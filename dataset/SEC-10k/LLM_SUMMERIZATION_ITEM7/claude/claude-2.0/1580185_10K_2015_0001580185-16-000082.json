Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors\u201d and the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements\u201d sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a diversified financial services company that specializes in providing solutions to consumers in need of cash. Our direct-to-consumer businesses use the internet, television, direct mailing, and other channels to offer a variety of solutions including structured settlement payment purchasing, mortgage origination (both purchase and refinancing), prepaid cards and access to personal lending. We warehouse, securitize, sell or otherwise finance the financial assets that we purchase in transactions that are structured to ultimately generate cash proceeds to us that exceed the purchase price we paid for those assets.\nWe currently operate our business through two business segments: (i) Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing and (ii) Home Lending. Our Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment provides liquidity to customers by purchasing structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams. Our Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment also includes prepaid card solutions, providing access to personal lending and funding for pre-settled legal claims as well as our corporate activities. Our Home Lending segment specializes in originating, selling and servicing residential mortgage loans.\nIn recent years we have focused on leveraging our brands, direct marketing capabilities and operational and underwriting capabilities to enter into new lines of business. We have executed on this strategy in 2015 through the acquisition of our mortgage lending business, J.G. Wentworth Home Lending, and the development of our prepaid card solutions and our platform for access to personal lending. As of December 31, 2015, our prepaid card solutions and personal lending platform were still in the nascent stage of development and had not generated significant revenues. Following this expansion, we are focusing on integration, stabilization and profitability, while also looking to grow our nascent lines of business.\n2015 Highlights\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We executed on our strategy of becoming a more diversified company by acquiring Home Lending on July 31, 2015 and establishing the Home Lending segment. For the five months ended December 31, 2015, Home Lending originated approximately 3,300 mortgage loans totaling $843.2 million (inclusive of $0.3 million of mortgage-brokered origination activity) and generated $2.0 million in pre-tax income.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment reported a loss before income taxes of $217.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to income before income taxes of $117.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a $224.7 million decline in revenue and $121.6 million of impairment charges. In late 2015, we began to implement a series of transformation efforts to offset the challenges that resulted in the segment's disappointing results, including cost reduction activities that we anticipate will result in approximately $25 to $30 million in annual pre-tax cost savings, a restructuring of the purchasing organization, and a realignment of our marketing activities that together, we believe, will more appropriately size the business to the segment's current market conditions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Consolidated Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>296,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>494,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(198,009\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>511,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income before income taxes\n</td> <td>(215,356\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(333,109\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(282.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Benefit) provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>(18,216\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39,356\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(186.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>(197,140\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(293,753\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(304.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>(101,828\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(167,230\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(255.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income attributable to The J.G.

Our Home Lending segment, which we acquired on July 31, 2015, generated pre-tax income of $2.0 million in the current year.\nWe recorded a consolidated income tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2015 of $18.2 million compared to a provision for income taxes of $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our overall effective tax rate was 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to an overall effective rate of 17.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The reduction in the overall effective tax rate was due primarily to the impact of the permanent differences between book and taxable income (loss), including the $121.6 million impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets recorded in 2015.\nThe net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interests represents the portion of (loss) earnings attributable to the economic interests in JGW LLC held by the non-controlling Common Interestholders.

The $1.3 million decrease in interest income on pre-settlement funding transaction receivables was due to a reduction in the associated VIE and other finance receivables resulting from management's decision to curtail purchases of such assets in April 2015.\nRealized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt, and derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was comprised of the following:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(60,367\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gains (losses) on securitized finance receivables, debt and related derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75,834\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(160,790\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(189.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives related to warehouse facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(441.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total realized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt and derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(221,082\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(73.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $160.8 million change in unrealized gains (losses) on securitized finance receivables, debt and related derivatives was primarily the result of an unfavorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value our residual interest cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a favorable movement in the associated fair value interest rate during the year ended December 31, 2014. Specifically, the discount rate used to fair value our residual interests increased from 5.97% as of December 31, 2014 to 8.30% as of December 31, 2015 as result of the widening of spreads in the asset-backed securities market during 2015. In comparison, the discount rate used to fair value our residual interests decreased from 7.85% as of December 31, 2013 to 5.97% at December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of both the decrease in spreads in the asset-backed securities market and in long term interest rates in general during 2014; both of which are used in the calculation of the fair value discount rate used to estimate the fair value of our residual interest cash flows.\nTotal realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $60.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of the following: (i) approximately $45.2 million of the decrease was due to a decrease in the discount rate applied to TRB purchases, or purchase yield, as compared to the prior year coupled with an unfavorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value these assets during the respective periods, and (ii) approximately\n$15.2 million of the decrease was due to a $73.8 million decrease, or 7.0%, in guaranteed structured settlements, annuities and lotteries and life contingent structured settlements and annuities TRB purchases, from $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $976.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nA decrease in our purchase yield in isolation results in an increase in the purchase price of a structured settlement, annuity or lottery transaction which consequently results in a reduced realized or unrealized gain on unsecuritized finance receivables. During 2015, we experienced significant competitive pressure in the segment and despite efforts to increase purchase yields, our average purchase yield on guaranteed structured settlements (the largest component of our TRB purchases) decreased approximately 109 basis points in 2015 from the prior year.\nIn contrast to the impact of purchase yield on our revenues, an increase (decrease) in the fair value discount rate in isolation results in a decrease (increase) in the estimated fair value of the associated asset which consequently results in a reduced realized or unrealized gain on unsecuritized finance receivables. The weighted average discount rate used to fair value our unsecuritized guaranteed structured settlement finance receivables as of December 31, 2015 was 4.94%, 110 basis-points higher than the 3.84% weighted average discount rate used to fair value our unsecuritized guaranteed structured settlement finance receivables as of December 31, 2014. In contrast, the 3.84% weighted average discount rate used as of December 31, 2014 was 112 basis-points lower than the 4.96% weighted average discount rate used to fair value our guaranteed structured settlement finance receivables of December 31, 2013. The increase in the fair value discount rates used to discount our unsecuritized finance receivables during 2015 was attributable to the increase in the spreads in the asset-backed securities market, partially offset by a general decline in interest rates as evidenced by the yield on 10-year LIBOR swaps decreasing from an average of 2.7% in 2014 to 2.2% in 2015.\nRealized and unrealized (losses) gains on marketable securities, net, was a $4.6 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2015, an unfavorable change from the $0.9 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to lower investment returns on marketable securities. The decrease was primarily offset by a corresponding decrease in installment obligations (income) expense, net. These amounts relate to the marketable securities and installment obligations payable on our consolidated balance sheets. The marketable securities are owned by us but are held to fully offset our installment obligations liability. Therefore, increases or decreases in gains on marketable securities do not impact our net income.\nGain on extinguishment of debt, net, was $0.6 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 2015 gain resulted from the early repayment of the 2004-A securitization debt. The associated finance receivables were included in the 2015-1 securitization. In 2014, we repaid approximately $6.1 million of long-term debt issued by the 2002-A securitization and recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of $0.3 million.\nThe $2.1 million decrease in realized gains on notes receivable, at fair value resulted from the repayment of a note receivable during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $487.0 million, an increase of $110.4 million, or 29.3%, from expenses of $376.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAdvertising expense, which consists of our marketing costs including television, internet, direct mail and other related expenses, decreased to $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a $13.2 million decrease in our television spend that was partially offset by a $4.7 million net increase in our internet, direct mailing, and other advertising expenses. We continually assess the effectiveness of our advertising initiatives and adjust the timing, investment and advertising channels on an ongoing basis.\nInterest expense, which includes interest on our securitization and other VIE long-term debt, warehouse facilities and our term loan, increased by 3.1% to $207.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $200.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $6.3 million increase was primarily attributable to: (i) a $4.2 million increase in interest expense associated with our VIE securitized debt that resulted from an increase in the average outstanding balance between periods, partially offset by a decrease in the interest rate used to calculate interest expense and (ii) a $1.9 million increase in interest expense associated with our VIE long term debt that was principally due an increase in the average outstanding balance of our residual term debt and an increase and in the corresponding interest rate. In August 2015, we amended our residual term loan to increase the principal amount outstanding by $25.0 million to $133.0 million. In connection with the amendment, the interest rate increased from 7.00% to 7.25%.\nCompensation and benefits expense decreased to $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to (i) a $3.5 million decrease in incentive compensation expense and (ii) a $1.1 million reduction in share based compensation expense, which was partially offset by (a) a $1.0 million increase in severance expense related to the departure of several senior executives during the year ended 2015, including our former President and Chief Operating Officer, and (b) higher labor costs necessary to execute on our strategy of entering new lines of business and improving our information, data and analytic capabilities.\nProfessional and consulting costs increased to $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to $3.8 million in third-party fees incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of Home Lending and the reorganization of our structured settlement purchasing organization, partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in legal expense.\nThe decrease in debt issuance costs from the prior year was due to a $1.9 million reduction in underwriting fees resulting from the lower volume of securitized debt issued in the current year. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we issued approximately $475.9 million in securitized debt, a decrease of $193.1 million from the approximately $669.0 million in securitized debt issued in 2014. Underwriting fees associated with our securitizations are calculated as a percentage of the principal amount of debt issued.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we re-evaluated our projections for our Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment based on lower than anticipated results, a significant decline in the stock price of our Class A common stock, and a re-assessment of the reporting unit's brand strategy. Accordingly, we determined these events constituted a triggering event requiring us to test the goodwill and definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the 2011 acquisition of Orchard Acquisition Company, or OAC, for potential impairment. As a result of this analysis, we determined in the third quarter that the trade name within the reporting unit was impaired and recorded a $29.9 million impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test. The results of the analysis indicated an additional impairment of the trade name as well as an impairment of the goodwill within the reporting unit. Consequently, we recorded an additional impairment charge of $91.7 million in the fourth quarter comprised of the following: (i) an $85.0 million write-down of goodwill, (ii) an additional $5.6 million write-down of the indefinite-lived trade name, and (iii) and a $1.1 million write-down of other intangible assets. While we believe our assumptions used in the determination of the asset's fair value are reasonable, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Less than anticipated revenues generated by the remaining intangible assets, an increase in discount rates, and/or a decrease in our projected growth rates used in the discounted cash flow model could result in future impairment charges.\nComparison of Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td>

7.6%, from revenues of $459.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.The increase was primarily attributable to a $47.9 million increase in unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt and derivatives and a $14.5 million increase in interest income. This was partially offset by a $14.4 million decrease in realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities, net, and a $13.9 million decrease in gain on extinguishment of debt, net.\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $187.0 million, an increase of $14.5 million, or 8.4%, from $172.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in our finance receivables balance.\nUnrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt, and derivatives was $300.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $47.9 million, or 18.9%, from $252.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily driven by a $42.6 million increase in unrealized gains on securitized finance receivables, debt and related derivatives, including our residual interest in securitized finance receivables, which resulted from a more favorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value our residual interest cash flows during the respective periods.\nRealized and unrealized gains on marketable securities, net, was $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease from a $15.3 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2013, due to lower investment returns on marketable securities. The decrease was primarily offset by a corresponding decrease in installment obligations expense, net. These amounts relate to the marketable securities and installment obligations payable on our consolidated balance sheets. The marketable securities are owned by us but are held to fully offset our installment obligations liability. Therefore, increases or decreases in gains on marketable securities do not impact our net income.\nGain on extinguishment of debt, net, was $0.3 million and $14.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2014, we repaid approximately $6.1 million of long-term debt issued by the 2002-A securitization and recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of $0.3 million. During 2013 and in connection with our 2013-3 securitization, we repaid approximately $64.0 million of long term debt issued by a permanent financing VIE and recorded a one-time gain on debt extinguishment of $22.1 million that was reduced by a debt prepayment penalty and hedge breakage costs totaling $7.9 million in aggregate.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $376.6 million, a decrease of $18.6 million, or 4.7%, from expenses of $395.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nAdvertising expense, which consists of our marketing costs including television, internet, direct mail and other related expenses, decreased to $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $70.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to the timing of our new internet and television advertising initiatives.\nInterest expense, which includes interest on our securitization debt, warehouse facilities and the term loan, increased by 4.0% to $200.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $193.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This $7.8 million increase was primarily driven by a $16.3 million increase in interest expense associated with our securitization debt that resulted from an increase in the average debt balances outstanding, partially offset by a $7.8 million decrease in the interest expense associated with our term loan resulting from a partial repayment in December 2013 and the associated amendment that reduced the term loan's coupon interest rate.\nCompensation and benefits expense decreased to $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $42.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of cost savings associated with the downsizing of our Boynton Beach office.\nGeneral and administrative costs decreased to $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to decreases of $1.5 million in rent and utilities and $0.5 million in information technology expense that resulted from the closing of our Boynton Beach office. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $1.0 million in insurance expense that was the result of additional insurance requirements associated with becoming a publicly-traded company.\nProvision for losses on finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased to $4.8 million from $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to a reduction in the provision for losses associated with pre-settlement funding transactions.\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased to $4.2 million from $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to certain intangible assets that arose in connection with the our merger with Orchard Acquisition Company, LLC and its subsidiaries in 2011 becoming fully amortized by the end of fiscal year 2013 and a decrease in the depreciation on fixed assets resulting from the downsizing of our Boynton Beach office.\nImpairment charges and loss on disposal of assets for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $4.2 million primarily due to the $4.0 million write-down of costs capitalized in conjunction with a software development project that we decided to discontinue in the fourth quarter of 2013.\nRestructuring Expense\nIn April 2013, we announced our intention to restructure our Boynton Beach office. In connection with this announcement, we recorded a restructuring charge of $3.6 million which was recorded in the following statement of operations line items: $2.9 million in compensation and benefits and $0.7 million in general and administrative. The associated workforce reductions were substantially completed as of December 31, 2013.\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net Income (Loss), a Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nWe use Adjusted Net Income (Loss), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of our results from operations, which we define as our net income (loss) under GAAP before non-cash compensation expenses, certain other non-routine expenses, provision for or benefit from income taxes and the amounts related to the consolidation of the securitization and permanent financing trusts we use to finance our business. We use Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as a measure of our overall performance because the operations of these variable interest entities do not impact the Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment's business performance. In addition, the add-backs described above are consistent with adjustments permitted under our term loan agreement.\nYou should not consider Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nA reconciliation of our (loss) income before income taxes as reported under GAAP to Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for our Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment was as follows:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(217,348\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to reflect de-consolidation of securitizations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination of unrealized gain/loss on finance receivables, long-term debt and derivatives from post securitization due to changes in interest rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(84,955\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42,358\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination of interest income from securitized finance receivables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(171,773\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(166,888\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(150,945\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income on retained interests in finance receivables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Servicing income on securitized finance receivables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination of interest expense on long-term debt related to securitization and permanent financing trusts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees relating to securitizations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of prefunding on unsecuritized finance receivables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,566\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges and loss on disposal of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance, mergers and acquisitions and consulting expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,383\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Net (Loss) Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,386\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment reported Adjusted Net Loss of $1.4 million compared to Adjusted Net Income of $43.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The primary driver behind the $45.0 million unfavorable change was a $60.4 million decline in realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables which resulted from: (i) the combined effect of a decline in purchase yields and an increase in the fair value discount rates between periods, and (ii) a $73.8 million, or 7.0%, decrease in guaranteed structured settlements, annuities and lotteries and life contingent structured settlements and annuities TRB purchases. Partially offsetting the decrease in realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables was an $8.5 million decrease in advertising expense and a $1.9 million decrease in debt issuance costs from the prior year. As a result of these items, total expenses, after adjusting for the impact of the de-consolidation of the securitization entities, share-based compensation, income taxes, and other non-routine items decreased $10.6 million from the prior year.\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nAdjusted Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased $3.0 million to $43.6 million from $46.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $13.9 million decrease in gains on debt extinguishment, partially offset by a $10.7 million decrease in total expenses, after adjusting for the impact of the de-consolidation of the securitization entities, share-based compensation, income taxes, and other non-routine items. During 2013 and in connection with our 2013-3 securitization, we repaid approximately $64.0 million of long term debt issued by a permanent financing VIE and recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of $22.1 million that was reduced by a debt prepayment penalty and hedge breakage costs totaling $7.9 million in aggregate.\nHome Lending\nHome Lending Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe table below presents the results of operations for our Home Lending segment from July 31, 2015, the date of our acquisition, through December 31, 2015.\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REVENUES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>809\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized and unrealized gains on sale of mortgage loans held for sale, net of direct costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in mortgage servicing rights, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Servicing, broker, and other fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan origination fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EXPENSES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional and consulting\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>685\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct subservicing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>948\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>735\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Metrics\nKey operating statistics related to the origination and servicing of mortgage loans since the July 31, 2015 acquisition date were as follows:\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Period July 31, 2015 through December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan Origination\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate locks - units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate locks - volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,290,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans closed - units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans closed - volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>843,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of 12/31/2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage Servicing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan count - servicing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average loan amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.72\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn evaluating performance, we net gains on mortgage loans sold, unrealized gains on mortgage loans held for sale, interest rate lock commitments, or IRLCs, and associated derivative instruments (i.e., forward sales commitments to deliver mortgage loans and forwards sales of MBS) resulting from fair value mark-to-market adjustments, with direct costs such as fees paid to third parties to originate and sell the associated mortgage loans, and present it as realized and unrealized gains on sale of mortgage loans held for sale, net of direct costs in our consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated $20.5 million in gross revenue from the sale of mortgage loans and netted against it $1.9 million in direct costs.\nLoan origination fee income of $2.5 million represents revenue earned from originating mortgage loans and generally represents flat, per loan fee amounts.\nServicing, broker and other fees for the Home Lending segment represent revenue recognized for servicing mortgage loans for various investors that are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance. The primary driver of our servicing revenue is our MSR portfolio, which had an outstanding unpaid principal balance of $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2015, an increase of $212.4 million from the acquisition date.\nU.S. GAAP requires that MSRs initially be recorded at fair value at the time the underlying mortgage loans are sold with servicing rights retained. MSRs are subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting period. The increase (decrease) in the value of our MSR portfolio results from: (i) loans sold with servicing rights retained, (ii) the runoff of our MSR portfolio including payoffs, and (iii) changes in fair valuation inputs and assumptions are included in the changes in mortgage servicing rights, net in our consolidated statement of operations. From the date of acquisition through December 31, 2015, the fair value of our MSRs increased by approximately $1.6 million primarily due to the $212.4 million increase in the unpaid principal balance of our MSR portfolio.\nInterest income principally relates to our mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value which is accrued to income based on the principal amount outstanding and contractual interest rates.\nAdvertising expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 included approximately $0.7 million in costs associated with the re-branding of WestStar Mortgage Inc. as J.G. Wentworth Home Lending, Inc. (and ultimately J. G. Wentworth Home Lending, LLC) and the production costs for new television commercials that began to air in the third quarter of 2015.\nInterest expense represents interest on Home Lending's: (i) five warehouse credit facilities with various financial institutions used to originate mortgage loans held for sale that have a combined maximum borrowing capacity of $200.0 million; and (ii) an operating line of credit (collateralized by our MSRs) with a maximum borrowing capacity of $6.0 million.\nCompensation and benefits includes salaries for Home Lending employees, commissions paid to loan officers, applicable taxes and the cost of providing employee benefits.\nHome Lending's general and administrative expense primarily represents the cost to lease and operate the segment's headquarters in Woodbridge, Virginia and the various retail and direct lending call center offices across the country.\nThe provision for losses represents an estimate of losses to be incurred on the repurchase or indemnification of purchasers of mortgage loans. Certain sales contracts and GSE standards require us to repurchase a loan or indemnify the purchaser or insurer for losses if a borrower fails to make initial loan payments or if the accompanying mortgage loan fails to meet certain customary representations and warranties, such as the nature and extent of underwriting standards. In the event of a breach of the representations and warranties, we may be required to either repurchase the loan or indemnify the purchaser for losses it sustains on the loan. We record a provision for estimated repurchases and loss indemnification on loans sold, which is charged to the provision for losses.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income, a Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nWe use Adjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of Home Lending's results from operations, which we define as our net income under GAAP before non-cash compensation expenses, certain other non-routine expenses, and provision for or benefit from income taxes. We exclude these items in our calculation of Adjusted Net Income since we do not consider them part of our core operating results. In addition, these excluded items are consistent with adjustments permitted under our term loan agreement.\nYou should not consider Adjusted Net Income as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted Net Income may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nA reconciliation of our net income before income taxes as reported under GAAP to Adjusted Net Income for our Home Lending segment was as follows:\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income before taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>None\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Net Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nQuarterly Financial Data\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>First Quarter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands, except for per share data)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(113,213\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64,879\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,649\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,615\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>(107,420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57,627\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26,633\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,460\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>(52,446\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,930\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,337\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,115\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to The J.G.

The cash used in operating activities does not reflect the financing of our purchased receivables which is an integral part of our Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment and is reflected in net cash provided by financing activities. The $274.1 million decrease in the net cash used in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to: (i) a $155.1 million decrease related to changes in restricted cash and investments primarily due to the timing and structure of securitizations in the fourth quarters of 2015, 2014 and 2013, (ii) a $54.1 million decrease in purchases of finance receivables, (iii) a $27.0 increase in collections on finance receivables, (iv) a $24.6 million decrease resulting from the Home Lending segment's proceeds from the sale and principal payments on mortgage loans held for sale (net of originations and purchases of mortgages held for sale), and (v) a $21.9 million increase in net proceeds from the sale of finance receivables.\nUntil our 2015-3 securitization, our securitization transactions had historically been structured with an \"initial close\" in which we issued the principal amount of securitized debt and received: (i) cash in exchange for assets delivered and (ii) restricted cash in exchange for assets to be delivered 60 to 90 days in the future (referred to as the \"pre-funding\" date). On the pre-funding date, additional assets would be delivered to the lenders in return for the lifting of restrictions on the restricted cash. As a result\nof structuring the securitizations in this fashion, our restricted cash balances have fluctuated significantly depending on the timing of the transactions' initial close and their associated pre-funding dates.\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 included the impact of an $88.9 million increase in restricted cash that primarily related to the net effect of the following: (a) both 2013-3 securitization's initial-close and pre-funding occurring in the fourth quarter of 2013 and (b) our 2014-3 securitization's initial-close occurring in the fourth quarter of 2014 but the associated pre-funding occurring in the first quarter of 2015. As a result of the timing of the 2013-3 and 2014-3 pre-fundings, restricted cash increased $71.8 million between December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 included the impact of a $66.2 million decrease in restricted cash during the year that primarily related to the net effect of: (a) the timing of 2014-3 securitization's pre-funding discussed previously and (b) our 2015-3 securitization being structured with only an initial-close and not having an associated pre-funding. The impact of the timing and structure of the 2014-3 and 2015-3 securitizations was a $71.8 million decrease in our restricted cash balance between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015.\nCash Flow from Investment Activities\nNet cash used in investment activities was $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to net cash provided by investment activities of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $56.3 million change was primarily due to: (i) $47.4 million of net cash used to acquire our Home Lending segment in 2015 and (ii) the collection of a $6.1 million note receivable in 2014.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $191.9 million and $396.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The $204.7 million decrease was primarily attributable to a $280.7 million decrease in proceeds received from the issuance of securitization and other VIE long-term debt combined with a $10.0 million increase in purchases of treasury stock, partially offset by: (i) a $45.2 million increase in proceeds (net of repayments) from our revolving credit facilities, and (ii) a $38.1 million reduction in the repayment of securitization and other VIE long-term debt and derivatives.\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $399.8 million and $312.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The cash used in operating activities does not reflect the financing of our purchased receivables which is an integral part of our business and is reflected in the cash flow from financing activities. This $87.0 million increase was primarily driven by a $92.4 million increase in the change in restricted cash and investments due to the timing of our securitizations in the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013 and a $47.9 million increase in unrealized gains (losses) on VIE finance receivables, long-term debt and derivatives due to a more favorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value our residual interest cash flows during the respective periods. These increases in cash used in operating activities were partially offset by a $34.8 million increase in net income and a $21.8 million increase in gain on extinguishment of debt that resulted from the one-time gain on debt extinguishment we recorded in 2013 when we repaid a portion of long-term debt issued by a permanent financing VIE in connection with our 2013-3 securitization.\nCash Flow from Investment Activities\nNet cash provided by investment activities was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $4.5 million for the year ended 2013. The $1.3 million increase was primarily driven by a $3.6 million increase in receipts from notes receivable and a $0.8 million decrease in purchases of intangible and fixed assets, net of sales proceeds partially offset by the collection of a $5.2 million note receivable from an affiliate in the prior year. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2014 we received $2.1 million of cash in connection with the merger of one of our subsidiaries with and into JGW Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of JLL Fund V AIF II, L.P. with JGW Holdings, Inc. surviving the merger and becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary. Please refer to Note 2 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $396.6 million and $244.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, representing an increase of $152.4 million which was primarily attributable to a $171.2 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of VIE long-term debt and a $63.1 million decrease in repayments of warehouse facilities. These increases in cash provided by financing activities were partially offset by a $98.9 million decrease in gross proceeds from the revolving credit facility. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was also attributable to non-recurring transactions that occurred during 2013. In 2013, we entered into a new credit facility which generated net proceeds of $557.2 million. In connection with the entry into this new credit facility, we made a cash distribution of $459.6 million to Common Interestholders and made $143.5 million in repayments under our existing debt obligations. Additionally, the issuance of Class A common stock pursuant to our IPO in November 2013 generated net proceeds to us of $141.3 million, $123.0 million of which was used to repay a portion of our term loan and related fees.\nFunding Sources\nWe utilize a number of different funding sources to finance our segments and their associated business activities.\nStructured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing Segment\nStructured Settlements and Annuities\nWe finance our guaranteed structured settlement and annuity payment stream purchases with available cash and cash equivalents or through four separate warehouse facilities. As of December 31, 2015, these four warehouse facilities had $750.0 million of aggregate capacity which consisted of: (i) a $300.0 million syndicated warehouse facility with a revolving period that ends in July 2016; (ii) a $300.0 million warehouse facility with a revolving period that ends in November 2016; (iii) a $100.0 million warehouse facility with a 2 year evergreen feature that requires the lender to give us 24 months' notice prior to terminating the facility's revolving line of credit; and (iv) a $50.0 million warehouse facility with a revolving period that ends in October 2016. Subsequent to the expiration or termination of their respective revolving lines of credit, each of our warehouse facilities has an amortization period of between 18 and 24 months before the final maturity, allowing us time to exit or refinance the warehouse facility after the revolving period has ended. As of December 31, 2015, we had $710.8 million in total unused borrowings capacity under any of the four separate warehouse facilities used to finance our guaranteed structured settlement and annuity payment stream purchases.\nWe regularly assess our warehouse facilities and adjust the nature and amount of our committed warehouse lines in light of market conditions. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we terminated the $50.0 million warehouse facility and may seek to amend the remaining three warehouse facilities to better reflect our financing needs as we proceed through the annual renewal processes in 2016.\nOur warehouse facilities are structured with advance rates that range from 92.5% to 95.5% and discount rates that range from 7.3% to 9.2%. The discount rate is either fixed over the term of the facility or is based on a fixed spread over a floating swap rate, which we then fix through interest rate swaps at the time of the borrowing. The discount rate is used to discount the payment streams we have purchased, and these discounted payment streams are then multiplied by the advance rate to determine the amount of funds that are available to us under the warehouse facilities.\nWe have historically undertaken non-recourse term securitizations once we have aggregated in our warehouse facilities a sufficient aggregate value of structured settlement and annuity payment streams to undertake a securitization. At the close of each such securitization, the outstanding amount under each of the warehouse facilities is repaid. The amount of net proceeds we receive from securitizations is typically in excess of the amount of funds required to repay the warehouse facilities, resulting in a positive cash flow at the time of securitization. We completed three securitizations in 2015, 2014 and 2013. On March 31, 2015, we closed our 2015-1 securitization with an aggregate note issuance amount of $214.1 million and a deal discount rate of 3.64% which generated net proceeds to us of $128.0 million. On July 28, 2015, we closed our 2015-2 securitization with an aggregate note issuance amount of $158.5 million and a deal discount rate of 4.18%, which generated net proceeds to us of $73.5 million. On November 30, 2015, we closed our 2015-3 securitization with an aggregate note issuance amount of $103.3 million and a deal discount rate of 4.46% which generated net proceeds to us of $32.4 million.\nWe intend, subject to market conditions, management discretion and other relevant factors, to undertake multiple securitizations or other financing transactions per year in the future. Other forms of financing transactions we may utilize include direct asset sales in which we sell entire finance receivable pools to third-parties, as opposed to retaining residual interests in the\nassets as we have historically done in our securitizations. In late 2015, we completed a direct asset sale comprised of approximately $20.8 million in discounted TRB purchases based on a discount rate of 5.42% that generated $6.3 million in net proceeds to us. In February 2016 we also executed a direct asset sale of up to $161.3 million in discounted TRB purchases based on a discount rate of 5.02% consisting of two asset pools. The first pool closed on February 18, 2016, consisted of $91.3 million in discounted TRB purchases, and generated net proceeds to us of over $26 million. The second pool of up to $70.0 million is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016 and will generate additional cash at that time. Diversifying our financing strategy allows us to realize greater cost efficiencies in our capital market transactions and provides us with increased flexibility.\nThe counterparties to the structured settlement and annuity payment streams we purchase have mostly investment grade credit ratings. Approximately 71.2% of the counterparties to structured settlement payment streams that we purchased in 2015 were rated A3\u201d or better by Moody's. This reduced credit risk, together with the long weighted average life and low pre-payment risk, results in a desirable asset class that can be securitized and sold in the asset-backed security market or through outright-sale transactions.\nLife Contingent Structured Settlements and Life Contingent Annuities\nWe finance our purchases of life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams through a committed permanent financing facility with a capacity of $150.0 million. This facility allows us to purchase life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams without assuming any mortality risk. This facility is structured as a permanent facility, whereby the life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams we purchase are financed for their entire life and remain within the facility until maturity. The payment streams purchased are funded at a fixed advance rate of 94%, while the discount rate used to value the payment streams is variable, depending on the characteristics of the payment streams. The life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams that we purchase are discounted at a higher rate than the discount rates applied to those payment streams under the committed permanent financing facility, with the result that the funds available to be drawn under the facility exceed the purchase price for the payment streams we purchase. This positive cash flow is used to support our business and cover a portion of our operating expenses. As of December 31, 2015, our permanent financing facility had $79.8 million of unused capacity for our life contingent annuity and structured settlement businesses.\nLotteries\nBeginning in 2013, we have been purchasing lottery payment streams. We have structured two of our guaranteed structured settlement and annuity warehouse facilities to allow us to finance lottery payment streams. This allows us to aggregate a pool of such payment streams that we subsequently securitize together with structured settlement and annuity payment streams. Lottery payment streams were included in all of our securitizations during 2015, 2014 and 2013. We intend to continue to securitize and /or include in direct asset sales lottery payment streams in the future.\nHistorically, we have funded the purchase of lottery payment streams through non-recourse financing as well as a diversified institutional funding base of more than five institutional investors who purchase lottery payment streams directly from us. These investors are either insurance companies or asset managers. Lottery payment streams are purchased by the investors and the transactions are structured as an asset sale to the investor. We earn the difference between the discount rate at which we purchase the lottery payment stream from the lottery prizewinner and the discount rate at which we sell the lottery payment stream to the investor.\nPre-Settlement Funding\nWe previously financed our pre-settlement funding transactions through a revolving credit facility. The $35.0 million facility was structured with a revolving period that ended on December 31, 2015. The principal amount outstanding under the facility as of December 31, 2015 was converted into a \"term advance\" requiring minimum principal payments over the subsequent 24 month amortization period with interest payable monthly and calculated in the same manner as the original credit facility.\nWe decided, beginning in April 2015, to curtail our purchases of pre-settlement transactions. We have, however, and will continue to broker leads for such transactions to third parties in exchange for broker or referral fees. This change has not had a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.\nCredit Facility\nWe have (i) a widely syndicated senior secured term loan with a principal balance of $449.5 million as of December 31,\n2015 which matures in February 2019, and (ii) a $20.0 million revolving commitment that matures in August 2017. At each interest reset date, we have the option to elect that the senior secured term loan be either a Eurodollar loan or a Base Rate loan. If a Eurodollar loan, interest accrues at either Libor or 1.0% (whichever is greater) plus a spread of 6.0%. If a Base Rate loan, interest accrues at prime or 2.0% (whichever is greater) plus a spread of 5.0%. The revolving commitment has the same interest rate terms as the senior secured term loan. There are no principal payments due on the senior secured term loan until its maturity in February 2019.\nThe Credit Facility requires us, to the extent that as of the last day of any fiscal quarter there are outstanding balances on the revolving commitment that exceed specific thresholds (i.e., generally 15% of the $20.0 million borrowing capacity, or $3.0 million), to comply with a maximum total leverage ratio, as defined. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving commitment, and, as a result, the maximum total leverage ratio requirement was not applicable. Had the leverage ratio requirement been applicable as of December 31, 2015, we would not have satisfied the maximum total leverage ratio requirement and would have been required to repay the outstanding borrowings in excess of the specified threshold.\nResidual Financing\nOn August 13, 2015, we amended the terms of our Residual Term Facility. The amendment primarily increased the principal balance to $133.0 million from $108.0 million. This facility is now secured by the cash flows from our residual interests in 28 securitizations and is structured with a $133.0 million A1 Note due in May 2021. The amendment also increased the interest rate on the Residual Term Facility to 7.25% from 7.0%. The Residual Term Facility does not require minimum annual principal payments.\nSecuritization Debt\nWe elected fair value treatment under Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 825, Financial Instruments, to measure the VIE long-term debt issued by securitization and permanent financing trusts and related VIE finance receivables. We have determined that measurement of the VIE long-term debt issued by securitization and permanent financing trusts at fair value better correlates with the fair value of the VIE finance receivables held by special purpose entities, or SPEs, which are held to provide the cash flow for the note obligations. The VIE debt issued by SPEs is non-recourse to us or our subsidiaries. Certain of our subsidiaries continue to receive fees for servicing the securitized assets which are eliminated in consolidation. In addition, the risk to our non-SPE subsidiaries from SPE losses is limited to cash reserve and residual interest amounts.\nOther Financing\nWe maintain other permanent financing arrangements that have been used in the past for longer term funding purposes. Each of these arrangements has assets pledged as collateral, the cash flows from which are used to satisfy the loan obligations. These other financing arrangements are more fully described in Notes 19 and 20 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nHome Lending Segment\nMortgage Loans Held For Sale\nWe finance our mortgage loan origination activities primarily through five separate warehouse facilities with an aggregate capacity of $200.0 million as of December 31, 2015. Subsequent to year-end, we expanded our borrowing facilities and the current aggregate borrowing capacity to $235.0 million. These credit facilities are generally renewed annually for a period of twelve months and represent secured lending facilities with our originated mortgage loans serving as collateral. In addition, our lenders require pledge fund deposits of approximately one percent of the facility's capacity be maintained with the lender. Without these facilities we would not be able to meet our short-term liquidity requirements to operate our Home Lending segment.\nOur Home Lending segment typically holds its mortgage loan inventory for 30-45 days with these warehouse facilities until the loans are sold to take-out investors or securitized directly with Ginnie Mae or Fannie Mae, at which time the amount outstanding with the warehouse facilities are repaid.\nThese warehouse facilities are used strictly to fund the origination of mortgage loans. Our ability to fund current operations depends upon our ability to secure these types of short-term financings on acceptable terms and to renew or replace the financings as they expire.\nOperating Line of Credit\nWe maintain a $6.0 million line of credit with a financial institution that is generally renewed annually for a period of twelve months and represents a secured lending facility with our MSRs serving as collateral.\nConsolidated Liquidity Needs\nShort-Term Liquidity Needs\nOur liquidity needs over the next 12 months are expected to be provided through: (i) cash generated from the purchase and subsequent securitization and other financing of structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams, and (ii) cash generated from our Home Lending segment's operations. Additionally, we may consider the financing of other uncollateralized assets such as our residual interests from recent securitizations that were not financed via the Residual Term Facility. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to securitize our payment streams or securitize/sell our mortgage loans at favorable rates, or obtain financing through borrowing or other means.\nLong-Term Liquidity Needs\nOur most significant needs for liquidity beyond the next 12 months are the repayment of the principal and interest amounts of our outstanding senior secured term loan and the repayment of our residual financing facility. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs through excess cash flow generated through our securitization program, bank borrowings, debt refinancings, and new debt and equity offerings. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to securitize our payment streams at favorable rates or obtain financing through borrowing or other means, refinance our debt or raise new debt or equity.\nAs a consequence of the initial sales and any future exchanges of Common Interests for shares of our Class A common stock or Class C common stock, we may increase our share of the tax basis of the assets then owned by JGW LLC. Any such increase in tax basis is anticipated to allow us the ability to reduce the amount of future tax payments to the extent that we have future taxable income. We are obligated, pursuant to our tax receivable agreement with all Common Interestholders who held in excess of approximately 1% of the Common Interests as of immediately prior to our IPO, to pay to such Common Interestholders, 85% of the amount of income tax we save for each tax period as a result of the tax benefits generated from the initial sales and any subsequent exchange of Common Interests for our Class A common stock or Class C common stock and from the use of certain tax attributes. We expect to fund these long-term requirements under the tax receivable agreement with tax distributions received from JGW LLC and, if necessary, loans from JGW LLC.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments (excluding interest rate swaps which are discussed in Derivatives and Other Hedging Instruments\u201d) as of December 31, 2015, and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. The table also reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding debt based on scheduled and/or expected repayment dates and the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2015. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as referenced in the table:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

The amendment also increased the interest rate on the Residual Term Facility to 7.25% from 7.0%. The Residual Term Facility does not require minimum annual principal payments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn establishing accounting policies within the framework of U.S. GAAP, management must make certain assessments, estimates, and choices that will result in the application of these principals in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies and estimates that we consider to be critical.\nConsolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The J.G. Wentworth Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest, and those variable interest entities where our wholly-owned subsidiaries are the primary beneficiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nIn the normal course of business, we are involved with various entities that are considered to be VIEs. A VIE is an entity that has either a total investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest under the voting interest model of consolidation. We are required to consolidate any VIE if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has the power to direct those activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses from or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We review all significant interests in the VIEs we are involved with including consideration of the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance and whether we have control over those activities. On an ongoing basis, we assess whether or not we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE.\nAs a result of adopting ASC 810, Consolidations, we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIEs used to securitize our finance receivables ( VIE finance receivables\u201d). We elected the fair value option with respect to assets and liabilities in our securitization VIEs as part of their initial consolidation on January 1, 2010.\nThe debt issued by our securitization VIEs is reported on our consolidated balance sheets as VIE long-term debt issued by securitization and permanent financing trusts, at fair value ( VIE securitization debt\u201d). The VIE securitization debt is recourse solely to the VIE finance receivables held by such SPEs thus is non-recourse to us and other consolidated subsidiaries. The VIEs will continue in operation until all securitization debt is paid and all residual cash flows are collected. Most consolidated VIEs have expected lives in excess of 20 years.\nWe acquire receivables associated with structured settlement payments from individuals in exchange for cash, and these receivables are carried at fair value. Unearned income is calculated as the amount the fair value exceeds the cost basis of the receivables. Unearned income on structured settlements is recognized as interest income using the effective interest method over the life of the related structured settlement. Changes in fair value are recorded in unrealized gains on finance receivables, long- term debt and derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe, through our subsidiaries, sell finance receivables to SPEs. An SPE issues notes secured by undivided interests in the receivables. Payments due on these notes generally correspond to receipts from the receivables in terms of the timing of payments due. We retain an interest in the SPEs and are deemed to have control over these SPEs due to our servicing or subservicing role and therefore consolidate these SPEs.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when the following conditions have been satisfied: (1) the transferred assets have been isolated from the Company, beyond the reach of the Company and its creditors; (2) the transferee obtains the right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets; and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity, or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets or through an agreement that permits the transferee to require the transferor to repurchase the transferred financial assets that is so favorable to the transferee that it is probable that the transferee will require the transferor to repurchase them. Transfers that do not meet the criteria to be accounted for as sales are accounted for as secured borrowings.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurement establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs of valuation techniques used to measure fair value. These three levels of fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices in markets that are not active or quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable, reflecting the entity's own assumptions about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the assets or owes the liabilities rather than an entity specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities at the measurement date. We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. We also evaluate various factors to determine whether certain transactions are orderly and may make adjustments to transactions or quoted prices when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have decreased significantly.\nThe above conditions could cause certain assets and liabilities to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2 or Level 3 or reclassified from Level 2 to Level 3. The inputs or methodology used for valuing the assets or liabilities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with the assets and liabilities.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in the business combination. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual measurement dates at the reporting unit level. We have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative testing for impairment is necessary. The initial qualitative approach assesses whether the existence of events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than carrying value, the two step quantitative impairment test is performed. A step 1 analysis involves calculating the fair value of the associated reporting unit and comparing it to the reporting unit's carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, step 2 of the impairment test must be performed. Step 2 involves calculating and comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value. Impairment is recognized if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its net book value. Such loss is calculated as the difference between the estimated implied fair value of goodwill and its carrying amount.\nWe have intangible assets which have indefinite and definite lives. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's carrying value may not be fully recoverable, and are tested at least annually. An impairment loss, calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset, is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset is less than the corresponding carrying value. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets include a trade name and licenses and approvals.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of databases, customer relationships, trade names and affinity relationships. Our databases are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 10 years. Customer relationships are amortized over their useful lives of 3 to 15 years; amortizable trade names are amortized over the useful life of 3 years; and affinity relationships are amortized over their useful life of 10 years.\nIncome Taxes\nJGW LLC and the majority of its subsidiaries operate in the U.S. as non-tax paying entities, and are treated as disregarded entities for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes and generally as corporate entities in non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, certain of JGW LLC's wholly owned subsidiaries are operating as corporations within the U.S. and subject to U.S. federal and state tax. As non-tax paying entities, the majority of JGW LLC's net income or loss is attributable to its members and included in their tax returns. The current and deferred income tax provision (benefit) relates to both the income (loss) attributable to the Corporation from JGW LLC and to the tax-paying subsidiaries of JGW LLC.\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of the differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe analyze our tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state and local tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. If, based on this analysis, we determine that uncertainties in tax positions exist, a reserve will be established. We will recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the consolidated statements of operations.\nTax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and evaluating tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties under U.S. GAAP. Management reviews its tax positions periodically and adjusts its tax balances as new information becomes available.\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe qualify as an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and may opt to, rely on exemptions from certain financial disclosure requirements under U.S. GAAP that are applicable to other companies that are not emerging growth companies. We intend to take advantage of the\nbenefits of this extended transition period. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers which relates to how an entity recognizes the revenue it expects to be entitled to for the transfer of promised goods and services to customers. The ASU will replace certain existing revenue recognition guidance when it becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of the ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-13, Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity which relates to how an entity accounts for the financial assets and the financial liabilities of a consolidated collateralized financing entity at fair value. The ASU will allow an entity to elect to measure their financial assets and financial liabilities using either the measurement alternative provided under this ASU, which allows for the entity to measure both the financial assets and the financial liabilities of its collateralized financing entities in its consolidated financial statements using the more observable fair value of either the financial assets or financial liabilities, or under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2015 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern which requires management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The standard is effective for all entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Management does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis which requires an entity to re-evaluate its consolidation for limited partnerships or similar entities. The ASU requires an entity to apply this amendment using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The ASU changes the criteria that an entity uses to identify a variable interest entity, how it characterizes the VIE for a limited partnership or similar entity and how it determines the primary beneficiary. For public entities, the ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and for nonpublic entities beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs which relates to how an entity accounts for the recognition of debt issuance costs as a deferred charge. The ASU will require an entity to recognize debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2015 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The standard requires the new guidance to be adopted on a retrospective basis wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented will be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying this ASU. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments which relates to how and when the acquiring entity recognizes adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period. This ASU eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for these adjustments to their respective provisional amount with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2015 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016. Management does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes which requires an entity to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as concurrent in the classifies statement of financial position. For public entities, the ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and for all other entities beginning after\nDecember 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. Management does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Although the ASU retains many current requirements, it significantly revises an entity's accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017 and for all other entities beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases, at the commencement date of each lease. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments of this update should be applied using a modified retrospective approach, which requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors\u201d and the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements\u201d sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a diversified financial services company that specializes in providing solutions to consumers in need of cash. Our direct-to-consumer businesses use the internet, television, direct mailing, and other channels to offer a variety of solutions including structured settlement payment purchasing, mortgage origination (both purchase and refinancing), prepaid cards and access to personal lending. We warehouse, securitize, sell or otherwise finance the financial assets that we purchase in transactions that are structured to ultimately generate cash proceeds to us that exceed the purchase price we paid for those assets.\nWe currently operate our business through two business segments: (i) Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing and (ii) Home Lending. Our Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment provides liquidity to customers by purchasing structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams. Our Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment also includes prepaid card solutions, providing access to personal lending and funding for pre-settled legal claims as well as our corporate activities. Our Home Lending segment specializes in originating, selling and servicing residential mortgage loans.\nIn recent years we have focused on leveraging our brands, direct marketing capabilities and operational and underwriting capabilities to enter into new lines of business. We have executed on this strategy in 2015 through the acquisition of our mortgage lending business, J.G. Wentworth Home Lending, and the development of our prepaid card solutions and our platform for access to personal lending. As of December 31, 2015, our prepaid card solutions and personal lending platform were still in the nascent stage of development and had not generated significant revenues. Following this expansion, we are focusing on integration, stabilization and profitability, while also looking to grow our nascent lines of business.\n2015 Highlights\n \u2022 We executed on our strategy of becoming a more diversified company by acquiring Home Lending on July 31, 2015 and establishing the Home Lending segment. For the five months ended December 31, 2015, Home Lending originated approximately 3,300 mortgage loans totaling $843.2 million (inclusive of $0.3 million of mortgage-brokered origination activity) and generated $2.0 million in pre-tax income. \n \u2022 Our Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment reported a loss before income taxes of $217.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to income before income taxes of $117.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a $224.7 million decline in revenue and $121.6 million of impairment charges. In late 2015, we began to implement a series of transformation efforts to offset the challenges that resulted in the segment's disappointing results, including cost reduction activities that we anticipate will result in approximately $25 to $30 million in annual pre-tax cost savings, a restructuring of the purchasing organization, and a realignment of our marketing activities that together, we believe, will more appropriately size the business to the segment's current market conditions. \nResults of Operations\nComparison of Consolidated Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>296,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>494,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(198,009\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>511,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income before income taxes\n</td> <td>(215,356\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(333,109\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(282.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Benefit) provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>(18,216\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39,356\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(186.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>(197,140\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(293,753\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(304.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>(101,828\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(167,230\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(255.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income attributable to The J.G.

Our Home Lending segment, which we acquired on July 31, 2015, generated pre-tax income of $2.0 million in the current year.\nWe recorded a consolidated income tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2015 of $18.2 million compared to a provision for income taxes of $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our overall effective tax rate was 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to an overall effective rate of 17.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The reduction in the overall effective tax rate was due primarily to the impact of the permanent differences between book and taxable income (loss), including the $121.6 million impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets recorded in 2015.\nThe net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interests represents the portion of (loss) earnings attributable to the economic interests in JGW LLC held by the non-controlling Common Interestholders.

These increases were partially offset by a $13.9 million decrease in gain on extinguishment of debt, net.\nWe recorded a consolidated income tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2014 of $21.1 million compared to a provision for income taxes of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in our tax provision was primarily due to us owning an economic interest in JGW LLC for the entire 2014 fiscal year compared to the approximately 1.5 month period following our IPO during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nThe $65.4 million in net income attributable to non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2014 represents the non-controlling interests' 55.7% weighted average economic interest in JGW LLC's net income for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $67.4 million net income attributable to non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2013 represents the sum of: (i) 100% of the JGW LLC's net income for the period January 1, 2013

The $1.3 million decrease in interest income on pre-settlement funding transaction receivables was due to a reduction in the associated VIE and other finance receivables resulting from management's decision to curtail purchases of such assets in April 2015.\nRealized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt, and derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was comprised of the following:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(60,367\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gains (losses) on securitized finance receivables, debt and related derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75,834\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(160,790\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(189.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives related to warehouse facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(441.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total realized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt and derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(221,082\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(73.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $160.8 million change in unrealized gains (losses) on securitized finance receivables, debt and related derivatives was primarily the result of an unfavorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value our residual interest cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a favorable movement in the associated fair value interest rate during the year ended December 31, 2014. Specifically, the discount rate used to fair value our residual interests increased from 5.97% as of December 31, 2014 to 8.30% as of December 31, 2015 as result of the widening of spreads in the asset-backed securities market during 2015. In comparison, the discount rate used to fair value our residual interests decreased from 7.85% as of December 31, 2013 to 5.97% at December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of both the decrease in spreads in the asset-backed securities market and in long term interest rates in general during 2014; both of which are used in the calculation of the fair value discount rate used to estimate the fair value of our residual interest cash flows.\nTotal realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $60.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of the following: (i) approximately $45.2 million of the decrease was due to a decrease in the discount rate applied to TRB purchases, or purchase yield, as compared to the prior year coupled with an unfavorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value these assets during the respective periods, and (ii) approximately\n$15.2 million of the decrease was due to a $73.8 million decrease, or 7.0%, in guaranteed structured settlements, annuities and lotteries and life contingent structured settlements and annuities TRB purchases, from $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $976.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nA decrease in our purchase yield in isolation results in an increase in the purchase price of a structured settlement, annuity or lottery transaction which consequently results in a reduced realized or unrealized gain on unsecuritized finance receivables. During 2015, we experienced significant competitive pressure in the segment and despite efforts to increase purchase yields, our average purchase yield on guaranteed structured settlements (the largest component of our TRB purchases) decreased approximately 109 basis points in 2015 from the prior year.\nIn contrast to the impact of purchase yield on our revenues, an increase (decrease) in the fair value discount rate in isolation results in a decrease (increase) in the estimated fair value of the associated asset which consequently results in a reduced realized or unrealized gain on unsecuritized finance receivables. The weighted average discount rate used to fair value our unsecuritized guaranteed structured settlement finance receivables as of December 31, 2015 was 4.94%, 110 basis-points higher than the 3.84% weighted average discount rate used to fair value our unsecuritized guaranteed structured settlement finance receivables as of December 31, 2014. In contrast, the 3.84% weighted average discount rate used as of December 31, 2014 was 112 basis-points lower than the 4.96% weighted average discount rate used to fair value our guaranteed structured settlement finance receivables of December 31, 2013. The increase in the fair value discount rates used to discount our unsecuritized finance receivables during 2015 was attributable to the increase in the spreads in the asset-backed securities market, partially offset by a general decline in interest rates as evidenced by the yield on 10-year LIBOR swaps decreasing from an average of 2.7% in 2014 to 2.2% in 2015.\nRealized and unrealized (losses) gains on marketable securities, net, was a $4.6 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2015, an unfavorable change from the $0.9 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to lower investment returns on marketable securities. The decrease was primarily offset by a corresponding decrease in installment obligations (income) expense, net. These amounts relate to the marketable securities and installment obligations payable on our consolidated balance sheets. The marketable securities are owned by us but are held to fully offset our installment obligations liability. Therefore, increases or decreases in gains on marketable securities do not impact our net income.\nGain on extinguishment of debt, net, was $0.6 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 2015 gain resulted from the early repayment of the 2004-A securitization debt. The associated finance receivables were included in the 2015-1 securitization. In 2014, we repaid approximately $6.1 million of long-term debt issued by the 2002-A securitization and recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of $0.3 million.\nThe $2.1 million decrease in realized gains on notes receivable, at fair value resulted from the repayment of a note receivable during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $487.0 million, an increase of $110.4 million, or 29.3%, from expenses of $376.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAdvertising expense, which consists of our marketing costs including television, internet, direct mail and other related expenses, decreased to $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a $13.2 million decrease in our television spend that was partially offset by a $4.7 million net increase in our internet, direct mailing, and other advertising expenses. We continually assess the effectiveness of our advertising initiatives and adjust the timing, investment and advertising channels on an ongoing basis.\nInterest expense, which includes interest on our securitization and other VIE long-term debt, warehouse facilities and our term loan, increased by 3.1% to $207.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $200.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $6.3 million increase was primarily attributable to: (i) a $4.2 million increase in interest expense associated with our VIE securitized debt that resulted from an increase in the average outstanding balance between periods, partially offset by a decrease in the interest rate used to calculate interest expense and (ii) a $1.9 million increase in interest expense associated with our VIE long term debt that was principally due an increase in the average outstanding balance of our residual term debt and an increase and in the corresponding interest rate. In August 2015, we amended our residual term loan to increase the principal amount outstanding by $25.0 million to $133.0 million. In connection with the amendment, the interest rate increased from 7.00% to 7.25%.\nCompensation and benefits expense decreased to $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to (i) a $3.5 million decrease in incentive compensation expense and (ii) a $1.1 million reduction in share based compensation expense, which was partially offset by (a) a $1.0 million increase in severance expense related to the departure of several senior executives during the year ended 2015, including our former President and Chief Operating Officer, and (b) higher labor costs necessary to execute on our strategy of entering new lines of business and improving our information, data and analytic capabilities.\nProfessional and consulting costs increased to $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to $3.8 million in third-party fees incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of Home Lending and the reorganization of our structured settlement purchasing organization, partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in legal expense.\nThe decrease in debt issuance costs from the prior year was due to a $1.9 million reduction in underwriting fees resulting from the lower volume of securitized debt issued in the current year. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we issued approximately $475.9 million in securitized debt, a decrease of $193.1 million from the approximately $669.0 million in securitized debt issued in 2014. Underwriting fees associated with our securitizations are calculated as a percentage of the principal amount of debt issued.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we re-evaluated our projections for our Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment based on lower than anticipated results, a significant decline in the stock price of our Class A common stock, and a re-assessment of the reporting unit's brand strategy. Accordingly, we determined these events constituted a triggering event requiring us to test the goodwill and definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the 2011 acquisition of Orchard Acquisition Company, or OAC, for potential impairment. As a result of this analysis, we determined in the third quarter that the trade name within the reporting unit was impaired and recorded a $29.9 million impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test. The results of the analysis indicated an additional impairment of the trade name as well as an impairment of the goodwill within the reporting unit. Consequently, we recorded an additional impairment charge of $91.7 million in the fourth quarter comprised of the following: (i) an $85.0 million write-down of goodwill, (ii) an additional $5.6 million write-down of the indefinite-lived trade name, and (iii) and a $1.1 million write-down of other intangible assets. While we believe our assumptions used in the determination of the asset's fair value are reasonable, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Less than anticipated revenues generated by the remaining intangible assets, an increase in discount rates, and/or a decrease in our projected growth rates used in the discounted cash flow model could result in future impairment charges.\nComparison of Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td>

7.6%, from revenues of $459.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.The increase was primarily attributable to a $47.9 million increase in unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt and derivatives and a $14.5 million increase in interest income. This was partially offset by a $14.4 million decrease in realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities, net, and a $13.9 million decrease in gain on extinguishment of debt, net.\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $187.0 million, an increase of $14.5 million, or 8.4%, from $172.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in our finance receivables balance.\nUnrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt, and derivatives was $300.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $47.9 million, or 18.9%, from $252.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily driven by a $42.6 million increase in unrealized gains on securitized finance receivables, debt and related derivatives, including our residual interest in securitized finance receivables, which resulted from a more favorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value our residual interest cash flows during the respective periods.\nRealized and unrealized gains on marketable securities, net, was $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease from a $15.3 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2013, due to lower investment returns on marketable securities. The decrease was primarily offset by a corresponding decrease in installment obligations expense, net. These amounts relate to the marketable securities and installment obligations payable on our consolidated balance sheets. The marketable securities are owned by us but are held to fully offset our installment obligations liability. Therefore, increases or decreases in gains on marketable securities do not impact our net income.\nGain on extinguishment of debt, net, was $0.3 million and $14.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2014, we repaid approximately $6.1 million of long-term debt issued by the 2002-A securitization and recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of $0.3 million. During 2013 and in connection with our 2013-3 securitization, we repaid approximately $64.0 million of long term debt issued by a permanent financing VIE and recorded a one-time gain on debt extinguishment of $22.1 million that was reduced by a debt prepayment penalty and hedge breakage costs totaling $7.9 million in aggregate.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $376.6 million, a decrease of $18.6 million, or 4.7%, from expenses of $395.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nAdvertising expense, which consists of our marketing costs including television, internet, direct mail and other related expenses, decreased to $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $70.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to the timing of our new internet and television advertising initiatives.\nInterest expense, which includes interest on our securitization debt, warehouse facilities and the term loan, increased by 4.0% to $200.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $193.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This $7.8 million increase was primarily driven by a $16.3 million increase in interest expense associated with our securitization debt that resulted from an increase in the average debt balances outstanding, partially offset by a $7.8 million decrease in the interest expense associated with our term loan resulting from a partial repayment in December 2013 and the associated amendment that reduced the term loan's coupon interest rate.\nCompensation and benefits expense decreased to $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $42.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of cost savings associated with the downsizing of our Boynton Beach office.\nGeneral and administrative costs decreased to $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to decreases of $1.5 million in rent and utilities and $0.5 million in information technology expense that resulted from the closing of our Boynton Beach office. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $1.0 million in insurance expense that was the result of additional insurance requirements associated with becoming a publicly-traded company.\nProvision for losses on finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased to $4.8 million from $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to a reduction in the provision for losses associated with pre-settlement funding transactions.\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased to $4.2 million from $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to certain intangible assets that arose in connection with the our merger with Orchard Acquisition Company, LLC and its subsidiaries in 2011 becoming fully amortized by the end of fiscal year 2013 and a decrease in the depreciation on fixed assets resulting from the downsizing of our Boynton Beach office.\nImpairment charges and loss on disposal of assets for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $4.2 million primarily due to the $4.0 million write-down of costs capitalized in conjunction with a software development project that we decided to discontinue in the fourth quarter of 2013.\nRestructuring Expense\nIn April 2013, we announced our intention to restructure our Boynton Beach office. In connection with this announcement, we recorded a restructuring charge of $3.6 million which was recorded in the following statement of operations line items: $2.9 million in compensation and benefits and $0.7 million in general and administrative. The associated workforce reductions were substantially completed as of December 31, 2013.\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net Income (Loss), a Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nWe use Adjusted Net Income (Loss), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of our results from operations, which we define as our net income (loss) under GAAP before non-cash compensation expenses, certain other non-routine expenses, provision for or benefit from income taxes and the amounts related to the consolidation of the securitization and permanent financing trusts we use to finance our business. We use Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as a measure of our overall performance because the operations of these variable interest entities do not impact the Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment's business performance. In addition, the add-backs described above are consistent with adjustments permitted under our term loan agreement.\nYou should not consider Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nA reconciliation of our (loss) income before income taxes as reported under GAAP to Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for our Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment was as follows:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(217,348\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to reflect de-consolidation of securitizations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination of unrealized gain/loss on finance receivables, long-term debt and derivatives from post securitization due to changes in interest rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(84,955\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42,358\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination of interest income from securitized finance receivables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(171,773\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(166,888\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(150,945\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income on retained interests in finance receivables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Servicing income on securitized finance receivables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination of interest expense on long-term debt related to securitization and permanent financing trusts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees relating to securitizations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of prefunding on unsecuritized finance receivables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,566\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges and loss on disposal of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance, mergers and acquisitions and consulting expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,383\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Net (Loss) Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,386\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment reported Adjusted Net Loss of $1.4 million compared to Adjusted Net Income of $43.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The primary driver behind the $45.0 million unfavorable change was a $60.4 million decline in realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables which resulted from: (i) the combined effect of a decline in purchase yields and an increase in the fair value discount rates between periods, and (ii) a $73.8 million, or 7.0%, decrease in guaranteed structured settlements, annuities and lotteries and life contingent structured settlements and annuities TRB purchases. Partially offsetting the decrease in realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables was an $8.5 million decrease in advertising expense and a $1.9 million decrease in debt issuance costs from the prior year. As a result of these items, total expenses, after adjusting for the impact of the de-consolidation of the securitization entities, share-based compensation, income taxes, and other non-routine items decreased $10.6 million from the prior year.\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nAdjusted Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased $3.0 million to $43.6 million from $46.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $13.9 million decrease in gains on debt extinguishment, partially offset by a $10.7 million decrease in total expenses, after adjusting for the impact of the de-consolidation of the securitization entities, share-based compensation, income taxes, and other non-routine items. During 2013 and in connection with our 2013-3 securitization, we repaid approximately $64.0 million of long term debt issued by a permanent financing VIE and recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of $22.1 million that was reduced by a debt prepayment penalty and hedge breakage costs totaling $7.9 million in aggregate.\nHome Lending\nHome Lending Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe table below presents the results of operations for our Home Lending segment from July 31, 2015, the date of our acquisition, through December 31, 2015.\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REVENUES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>809\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized and unrealized gains on sale of mortgage loans held for sale, net of direct costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in mortgage servicing rights, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Servicing, broker, and other fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan origination fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EXPENSES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional and consulting\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>685\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct subservicing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>948\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>735\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Metrics\nKey operating statistics related to the origination and servicing of mortgage loans since the July 31, 2015 acquisition date were as follows:\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Period July 31, 2015 through December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan Origination\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate locks - units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate locks - volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,290,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans closed - units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans closed - volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>843,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of 12/31/2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage Servicing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan count - servicing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average loan amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.72\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn evaluating performance, we net gains on mortgage loans sold, unrealized gains on mortgage loans held for sale, interest rate lock commitments, or IRLCs, and associated derivative instruments (i.e., forward sales commitments to deliver mortgage loans and forwards sales of MBS) resulting from fair value mark-to-market adjustments, with direct costs such as fees paid to third parties to originate and sell the associated mortgage loans, and present it as realized and unrealized gains on sale of mortgage loans held for sale, net of direct costs in our consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated $20.5 million in gross revenue from the sale of mortgage loans and netted against it $1.9 million in direct costs.\nLoan origination fee income of $2.5 million represents revenue earned from originating mortgage loans and generally represents flat, per loan fee amounts.\nServicing, broker and other fees for the Home Lending segment represent revenue recognized for servicing mortgage loans for various investors that are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance. The primary driver of our servicing revenue is our MSR portfolio, which had an outstanding unpaid principal balance of $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2015, an increase of $212.4 million from the acquisition date.\nU.S. GAAP requires that MSRs initially be recorded at fair value at the time the underlying mortgage loans are sold with servicing rights retained. MSRs are subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting period. The increase (decrease) in the value of our MSR portfolio results from: (i) loans sold with servicing rights retained, (ii) the runoff of our MSR portfolio including payoffs, and (iii) changes in fair valuation inputs and assumptions are included in the changes in mortgage servicing rights, net in our consolidated statement of operations. From the date of acquisition through December 31, 2015, the fair value of our MSRs increased by approximately $1.6 million primarily due to the $212.4 million increase in the unpaid principal balance of our MSR portfolio.\nInterest income principally relates to our mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value which is accrued to income based on the principal amount outstanding and contractual interest rates.\nAdvertising expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 included approximately $0.7 million in costs associated with the re-branding of WestStar Mortgage Inc. as J.G. Wentworth Home Lending, Inc. (and ultimately J. G. Wentworth Home Lending, LLC) and the production costs for new television commercials that began to air in the third quarter of 2015.\nInterest expense represents interest on Home Lending's: (i) five warehouse credit facilities with various financial institutions used to originate mortgage loans held for sale that have a combined maximum borrowing capacity of $200.0 million; and (ii) an operating line of credit (collateralized by our MSRs) with a maximum borrowing capacity of $6.0 million.\nCompensation and benefits includes salaries for Home Lending employees, commissions paid to loan officers, applicable taxes and the cost of providing employee benefits.\nHome Lending's general and administrative expense primarily represents the cost to lease and operate the segment's headquarters in Woodbridge, Virginia and the various retail and direct lending call center offices across the country.\nThe provision for losses represents an estimate of losses to be incurred on the repurchase or indemnification of purchasers of mortgage loans. Certain sales contracts and GSE standards require us to repurchase a loan or indemnify the purchaser or insurer for losses if a borrower fails to make initial loan payments or if the accompanying mortgage loan fails to meet certain customary representations and warranties, such as the nature and extent of underwriting standards. In the event of a breach of the representations and warranties, we may be required to either repurchase the loan or indemnify the purchaser for losses it sustains on the loan. We record a provision for estimated repurchases and loss indemnification on loans sold, which is charged to the provision for losses.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income, a Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nWe use Adjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of Home Lending's results from operations, which we define as our net income under GAAP before non-cash compensation expenses, certain other non-routine expenses, and provision for or benefit from income taxes. We exclude these items in our calculation of Adjusted Net Income since we do not consider them part of our core operating results. In addition, these excluded items are consistent with adjustments permitted under our term loan agreement.\nYou should not consider Adjusted Net Income as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted Net Income may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nA reconciliation of our net income before income taxes as reported under GAAP to Adjusted Net Income for our Home Lending segment was as follows:\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income before taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>None\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Net Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nQuarterly Financial Data\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>First Quarter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands, except for per share data)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(113,213\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64,879\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,649\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,615\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>(107,420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57,627\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26,633\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,460\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>(52,446\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,930\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,337\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,115\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to The J.G.

The cash used in operating activities does not reflect the financing of our purchased receivables which is an integral part of our Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment and is reflected in net cash provided by financing activities. The $274.1 million decrease in the net cash used in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to: (i) a $155.1 million decrease related to changes in restricted cash and investments primarily due to the timing and structure of securitizations in the fourth quarters of 2015, 2014 and 2013, (ii) a $54.1 million decrease in purchases of finance receivables, (iii) a $27.0 increase in collections on finance receivables, (iv) a $24.6 million decrease resulting from the Home Lending segment's proceeds from the sale and principal payments on mortgage loans held for sale (net of originations and purchases of mortgages held for sale), and (v) a $21.9 million increase in net proceeds from the sale of finance receivables.\nUntil our 2015-3 securitization, our securitization transactions had historically been structured with an \"initial close\" in which we issued the principal amount of securitized debt and received: (i) cash in exchange for assets delivered and (ii) restricted cash in exchange for assets to be delivered 60 to 90 days in the future (referred to as the \"pre-funding\" date). On the pre-funding date, additional assets would be delivered to the lenders in return for the lifting of restrictions on the restricted cash. As a result\nof structuring the securitizations in this fashion, our restricted cash balances have fluctuated significantly depending on the timing of the transactions' initial close and their associated pre-funding dates.\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 included the impact of an $88.9 million increase in restricted cash that primarily related to the net effect of the following: (a) both 2013-3 securitization's initial-close and pre-funding occurring in the fourth quarter of 2013 and (b) our 2014-3 securitization's initial-close occurring in the fourth quarter of 2014 but the associated pre-funding occurring in the first quarter of 2015. As a result of the timing of the 2013-3 and 2014-3 pre-fundings, restricted cash increased $71.8 million between December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 included the impact of a $66.2 million decrease in restricted cash during the year that primarily related to the net effect of: (a) the timing of 2014-3 securitization's pre-funding discussed previously and (b) our 2015-3 securitization being structured with only an initial-close and not having an associated pre-funding. The impact of the timing and structure of the 2014-3 and 2015-3 securitizations was a $71.8 million decrease in our restricted cash balance between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015.\nCash Flow from Investment Activities\nNet cash used in investment activities was $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to net cash provided by investment activities of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $56.3 million change was primarily due to: (i) $47.4 million of net cash used to acquire our Home Lending segment in 2015 and (ii) the collection of a $6.1 million note receivable in 2014.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $191.9 million and $396.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The $204.7 million decrease was primarily attributable to a $280.7 million decrease in proceeds received from the issuance of securitization and other VIE long-term debt combined with a $10.0 million increase in purchases of treasury stock, partially offset by: (i) a $45.2 million increase in proceeds (net of repayments) from our revolving credit facilities, and (ii) a $38.1 million reduction in the repayment of securitization and other VIE long-term debt and derivatives.\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $399.8 million and $312.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The cash used in operating activities does not reflect the financing of our purchased receivables which is an integral part of our business and is reflected in the cash flow from financing activities. This $87.0 million increase was primarily driven by a $92.4 million increase in the change in restricted cash and investments due to the timing of our securitizations in the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013 and a $47.9 million increase in unrealized gains (losses) on VIE finance receivables, long-term debt and derivatives due to a more favorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value our residual interest cash flows during the respective periods. These increases in cash used in operating activities were partially offset by a $34.8 million increase in net income and a $21.8 million increase in gain on extinguishment of debt that resulted from the one-time gain on debt extinguishment we recorded in 2013 when we repaid a portion of long-term debt issued by a permanent financing VIE in connection with our 2013-3 securitization.\nCash Flow from Investment Activities\nNet cash provided by investment activities was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $4.5 million for the year ended 2013. The $1.3 million increase was primarily driven by a $3.6 million increase in receipts from notes receivable and a $0.8 million decrease in purchases of intangible and fixed assets, net of sales proceeds partially offset by the collection of a $5.2 million note receivable from an affiliate in the prior year. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2014 we received $2.1 million of cash in connection with the merger of one of our subsidiaries with and into JGW Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of JLL Fund V AIF II, L.P. with JGW Holdings, Inc. surviving the merger and becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary. Please refer to Note 2 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $396.6 million and $244.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, representing an increase of $152.4 million which was primarily attributable to a $171.2 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of VIE long-term debt and a $63.1 million decrease in repayments of warehouse facilities. These increases in cash provided by financing activities were partially offset by a $98.9 million decrease in gross proceeds from the revolving credit facility. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was also attributable to non-recurring transactions that occurred during 2013. In 2013, we entered into a new credit facility which generated net proceeds of $557.2 million. In connection with the entry into this new credit facility, we made a cash distribution of $459.6 million to Common Interestholders and made $143.5 million in repayments under our existing debt obligations. Additionally, the issuance of Class A common stock pursuant to our IPO in November 2013 generated net proceeds to us of $141.3 million, $123.0 million of which was used to repay a portion of our term loan and related fees.\nFunding Sources\nWe utilize a number of different funding sources to finance our segments and their associated business activities.\nStructured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing Segment\nStructured Settlements and Annuities\nWe finance our guaranteed structured settlement and annuity payment stream purchases with available cash and cash equivalents or through four separate warehouse facilities. As of December 31, 2015, these four warehouse facilities had $750.0 million of aggregate capacity which consisted of: (i) a $300.0 million syndicated warehouse facility with a revolving period that ends in July 2016; (ii) a $300.0 million warehouse facility with a revolving period that ends in November 2016; (iii) a $100.0 million warehouse facility with a 2 year evergreen feature that requires the lender to give us 24 months' notice prior to terminating the facility's revolving line of credit; and (iv) a $50.0 million warehouse facility with a revolving period that ends in October 2016. Subsequent to the expiration or termination of their respective revolving lines of credit, each of our warehouse facilities has an amortization period of between 18 and 24 months before the final maturity, allowing us time to exit or refinance the warehouse facility after the revolving period has ended. As of December 31, 2015, we had $710.8 million in total unused borrowings capacity under any of the four separate warehouse facilities used to finance our guaranteed structured settlement and annuity payment stream purchases.\nWe regularly assess our warehouse facilities and adjust the nature and amount of our committed warehouse lines in light of market conditions. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we terminated the $50.0 million warehouse facility and may seek to amend the remaining three warehouse facilities to better reflect our financing needs as we proceed through the annual renewal processes in 2016.\nOur warehouse facilities are structured with advance rates that range from 92.5% to 95.5% and discount rates that range from 7.3% to 9.2%. The discount rate is either fixed over the term of the facility or is based on a fixed spread over a floating swap rate, which we then fix through interest rate swaps at the time of the borrowing. The discount rate is used to discount the payment streams we have purchased, and these discounted payment streams are then multiplied by the advance rate to determine the amount of funds that are available to us under the warehouse facilities.\nWe have historically undertaken non-recourse term securitizations once we have aggregated in our warehouse facilities a sufficient aggregate value of structured settlement and annuity payment streams to undertake a securitization. At the close of each such securitization, the outstanding amount under each of the warehouse facilities is repaid. The amount of net proceeds we receive from securitizations is typically in excess of the amount of funds required to repay the warehouse facilities, resulting in a positive cash flow at the time of securitization. We completed three securitizations in 2015, 2014 and 2013. On March 31, 2015, we closed our 2015-1 securitization with an aggregate note issuance amount of $214.1 million and a deal discount rate of 3.64% which generated net proceeds to us of $128.0 million. On July 28, 2015, we closed our 2015-2 securitization with an aggregate note issuance amount of $158.5 million and a deal discount rate of 4.18%, which generated net proceeds to us of $73.5 million. On November 30, 2015, we closed our 2015-3 securitization with an aggregate note issuance amount of $103.3 million and a deal discount rate of 4.46% which generated net proceeds to us of $32.4 million.\nWe intend, subject to market conditions, management discretion and other relevant factors, to undertake multiple securitizations or other financing transactions per year in the future. Other forms of financing transactions we may utilize include direct asset sales in which we sell entire finance receivable pools to third-parties, as opposed to retaining residual interests in the\nassets as we have historically done in our securitizations. In late 2015, we completed a direct asset sale comprised of approximately $20.8 million in discounted TRB purchases based on a discount rate of 5.42% that generated $6.3 million in net proceeds to us. In February 2016 we also executed a direct asset sale of up to $161.3 million in discounted TRB purchases based on a discount rate of 5.02% consisting of two asset pools. The first pool closed on February 18, 2016, consisted of $91.3 million in discounted TRB purchases, and generated net proceeds to us of over $26 million. The second pool of up to $70.0 million is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016 and will generate additional cash at that time. Diversifying our financing strategy allows us to realize greater cost efficiencies in our capital market transactions and provides us with increased flexibility.\nThe counterparties to the structured settlement and annuity payment streams we purchase have mostly investment grade credit ratings. Approximately 71.2% of the counterparties to structured settlement payment streams that we purchased in 2015 were rated A3\u201d or better by Moody's. This reduced credit risk, together with the long weighted average life and low pre-payment risk, results in a desirable asset class that can be securitized and sold in the asset-backed security market or through outright-sale transactions.\nLife Contingent Structured Settlements and Life Contingent Annuities\nWe finance our purchases of life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams through a committed permanent financing facility with a capacity of $150.0 million. This facility allows us to purchase life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams without assuming any mortality risk. This facility is structured as a permanent facility, whereby the life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams we purchase are financed for their entire life and remain within the facility until maturity. The payment streams purchased are funded at a fixed advance rate of 94%, while the discount rate used to value the payment streams is variable, depending on the characteristics of the payment streams. The life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams that we purchase are discounted at a higher rate than the discount rates applied to those payment streams under the committed permanent financing facility, with the result that the funds available to be drawn under the facility exceed the purchase price for the payment streams we purchase. This positive cash flow is used to support our business and cover a portion of our operating expenses. As of December 31, 2015, our permanent financing facility had $79.8 million of unused capacity for our life contingent annuity and structured settlement businesses.\nLotteries\nBeginning in 2013, we have been purchasing lottery payment streams. We have structured two of our guaranteed structured settlement and annuity warehouse facilities to allow us to finance lottery payment streams. This allows us to aggregate a pool of such payment streams that we subsequently securitize together with structured settlement and annuity payment streams. Lottery payment streams were included in all of our securitizations during 2015, 2014 and 2013. We intend to continue to securitize and /or include in direct asset sales lottery payment streams in the future.\nHistorically, we have funded the purchase of lottery payment streams through non-recourse financing as well as a diversified institutional funding base of more than five institutional investors who purchase lottery payment streams directly from us. These investors are either insurance companies or asset managers. Lottery payment streams are purchased by the investors and the transactions are structured as an asset sale to the investor. We earn the difference between the discount rate at which we purchase the lottery payment stream from the lottery prizewinner and the discount rate at which we sell the lottery payment stream to the investor.\nPre-Settlement Funding\nWe previously financed our pre-settlement funding transactions through a revolving credit facility. The $35.0 million facility was structured with a revolving period that ended on December 31, 2015. The principal amount outstanding under the facility as of December 31, 2015 was converted into a \"term advance\" requiring minimum principal payments over the subsequent 24 month amortization period with interest payable monthly and calculated in the same manner as the original credit facility.\nWe decided, beginning in April 2015, to curtail our purchases of pre-settlement transactions. We have, however, and will continue to broker leads for such transactions to third parties in exchange for broker or referral fees. This change has not had a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.\nCredit Facility\nWe have (i) a widely syndicated senior secured term loan with a principal balance of $449.5 million as of December 31,\n2015 which matures in February 2019, and (ii) a $20.0 million revolving commitment that matures in August 2017. At each interest reset date, we have the option to elect that the senior secured term loan be either a Eurodollar loan or a Base Rate loan. If a Eurodollar loan, interest accrues at either Libor or 1.0% (whichever is greater) plus a spread of 6.0%. If a Base Rate loan, interest accrues at prime or 2.0% (whichever is greater) plus a spread of 5.0%. The revolving commitment has the same interest rate terms as the senior secured term loan. There are no principal payments due on the senior secured term loan until its maturity in February 2019.\nThe Credit Facility requires us, to the extent that as of the last day of any fiscal quarter there are outstanding balances on the revolving commitment that exceed specific thresholds (i.e., generally 15% of the $20.0 million borrowing capacity, or $3.0 million), to comply with a maximum total leverage ratio, as defined. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving commitment, and, as a result, the maximum total leverage ratio requirement was not applicable. Had the leverage ratio requirement been applicable as of December 31, 2015, we would not have satisfied the maximum total leverage ratio requirement and would have been required to repay the outstanding borrowings in excess of the specified threshold.\nResidual Financing\nOn August 13, 2015, we amended the terms of our Residual Term Facility. The amendment primarily increased the principal balance to $133.0 million from $108.0 million. This facility is now secured by the cash flows from our residual interests in 28 securitizations and is structured with a $133.0 million A1 Note due in May 2021. The amendment also increased the interest rate on the Residual Term Facility to 7.25% from 7.0%. The Residual Term Facility does not require minimum annual principal payments.\nSecuritization Debt\nWe elected fair value treatment under Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 825, Financial Instruments, to measure the VIE long-term debt issued by securitization and permanent financing trusts and related VIE finance receivables. We have determined that measurement of the VIE long-term debt issued by securitization and permanent financing trusts at fair value better correlates with the fair value of the VIE finance receivables held by special purpose entities, or SPEs, which are held to provide the cash flow for the note obligations. The VIE debt issued by SPEs is non-recourse to us or our subsidiaries. Certain of our subsidiaries continue to receive fees for servicing the securitized assets which are eliminated in consolidation. In addition, the risk to our non-SPE subsidiaries from SPE losses is limited to cash reserve and residual interest amounts.\nOther Financing\nWe maintain other permanent financing arrangements that have been used in the past for longer term funding purposes. Each of these arrangements has assets pledged as collateral, the cash flows from which are used to satisfy the loan obligations. These other financing arrangements are more fully described in Notes 19 and 20 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nHome Lending Segment\nMortgage Loans Held For Sale\nWe finance our mortgage loan origination activities primarily through five separate warehouse facilities with an aggregate capacity of $200.0 million as of December 31, 2015. Subsequent to year-end, we expanded our borrowing facilities and the current aggregate borrowing capacity to $235.0 million. These credit facilities are generally renewed annually for a period of twelve months and represent secured lending facilities with our originated mortgage loans serving as collateral. In addition, our lenders require pledge fund deposits of approximately one percent of the facility's capacity be maintained with the lender. Without these facilities we would not be able to meet our short-term liquidity requirements to operate our Home Lending segment.\nOur Home Lending segment typically holds its mortgage loan inventory for 30-45 days with these warehouse facilities until the loans are sold to take-out investors or securitized directly with Ginnie Mae or Fannie Mae, at which time the amount outstanding with the warehouse facilities are repaid.\nThese warehouse facilities are used strictly to fund the origination of mortgage loans. Our ability to fund current operations depends upon our ability to secure these types of short-term financings on acceptable terms and to renew or replace the financings as they expire.\nOperating Line of Credit\nWe maintain a $6.0 million line of credit with a financial institution that is generally renewed annually for a period of twelve months and represents a secured lending facility with our MSRs serving as collateral.\nConsolidated Liquidity Needs\nShort-Term Liquidity Needs\nOur liquidity needs over the next 12 months are expected to be provided through: (i) cash generated from the purchase and subsequent securitization and other financing of structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams, and (ii) cash generated from our Home Lending segment's operations. Additionally, we may consider the financing of other uncollateralized assets such as our residual interests from recent securitizations that were not financed via the Residual Term Facility. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to securitize our payment streams or securitize/sell our mortgage loans at favorable rates, or obtain financing through borrowing or other means.\nLong-Term Liquidity Needs\nOur most significant needs for liquidity beyond the next 12 months are the repayment of the principal and interest amounts of our outstanding senior secured term loan and the repayment of our residual financing facility. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs through excess cash flow generated through our securitization program, bank borrowings, debt refinancings, and new debt and equity offerings. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to securitize our payment streams at favorable rates or obtain financing through borrowing or other means, refinance our debt or raise new debt or equity.\nAs a consequence of the initial sales and any future exchanges of Common Interests for shares of our Class A common stock or Class C common stock, we may increase our share of the tax basis of the assets then owned by JGW LLC. Any such increase in tax basis is anticipated to allow us the ability to reduce the amount of future tax payments to the extent that we have future taxable income. We are obligated, pursuant to our tax receivable agreement with all Common Interestholders who held in excess of approximately 1% of the Common Interests as of immediately prior to our IPO, to pay to such Common Interestholders, 85% of the amount of income tax we save for each tax period as a result of the tax benefits generated from the initial sales and any subsequent exchange of Common Interests for our Class A common stock or Class C common stock and from the use of certain tax attributes. We expect to fund these long-term requirements under the tax receivable agreement with tax distributions received from JGW LLC and, if necessary, loans from JGW LLC.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments (excluding interest rate swaps which are discussed in Derivatives and Other Hedging Instruments\u201d) as of December 31, 2015, and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. The table also reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding debt based on scheduled and/or expected repayment dates and the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2015. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as referenced in the table:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

Acquisition, the credit facility was modified to permit mortgage financing indebtedness. Associated with this amendment we paid $0.2 million of consulting fees and incurred approximately $0.7 million in consent fees which were deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the modified debt as an adjustment to interest expense. No principal payments are due on the term loan until the date of maturity. Total outstanding borrowings under the new senior secured credit facility was $449.5 million as of December 31, 2015. \n (c) Certain of our contractual obligations and commitments are funded through cash flows from certain VIE finance receivables included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n (d) On August 13, 2015, we amended the terms of our Residual Term Facility. The amendment primarily increased the principal balance from $108.0 million to $133.0 million. This facility is now secured by the cash flows from our residual interests in 28 securitizations and is structured with a $133.0 million A1 Note due in May 2021. The amendment also increased the interest rate on the Residual Term Facility to 7.25% from 7.0%. The Residual Term Facility does not require minimum annual principal payments. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn establishing accounting policies within the framework of U.S. GAAP, management must make certain assessments, estimates, and choices that will result in the application of these principals in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies and estimates that we consider to be critical.\nConsolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The J.G. Wentworth Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest, and those variable interest entities where our wholly-owned subsidiaries are the primary beneficiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nIn the normal course of business, we are involved with various entities that are considered to be VIEs. A VIE is an entity that has either a total investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest under the voting interest model of consolidation. We are required to consolidate any VIE if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has the power to direct those activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses from or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We review all significant interests in the VIEs we are involved with including consideration of the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance and whether we have control over those activities. On an ongoing basis, we assess whether or not we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE.\nAs a result of adopting ASC 810, Consolidations, we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIEs used to securitize our finance receivables ( VIE finance receivables\u201d). We elected the fair value option with respect to assets and liabilities in our securitization VIEs as part of their initial consolidation on January 1, 2010.\nThe debt issued by our securitization VIEs is reported on our consolidated balance sheets as VIE long-term debt issued by securitization and permanent financing trusts, at fair value ( VIE securitization debt\u201d). The VIE securitization debt is recourse solely to the VIE finance receivables held by such SPEs thus is non-recourse to us and other consolidated subsidiaries. The VIEs will continue in operation until all securitization debt is paid and all residual cash flows are collected. Most consolidated VIEs have expected lives in excess of 20 years.\nWe acquire receivables associated with structured settlement payments from individuals in exchange for cash, and these receivables are carried at fair value. Unearned income is calculated as the amount the fair value exceeds the cost basis of the receivables. Unearned income on structured settlements is recognized as interest income using the effective interest method over the life of the related structured settlement. Changes in fair value are recorded in unrealized gains on finance receivables, long- term debt and derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe, through our subsidiaries, sell finance receivables to SPEs. An SPE issues notes secured by undivided interests in the receivables. Payments due on these notes generally correspond to receipts from the receivables in terms of the timing of payments due. We retain an interest in the SPEs and are deemed to have control over these SPEs due to our servicing or subservicing role and therefore consolidate these SPEs.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when the following conditions have been satisfied: (1) the transferred assets have been isolated from the Company, beyond the reach of the Company and its creditors; (2) the transferee obtains the right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets; and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity, or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets or through an agreement that permits the transferee to require the transferor to repurchase the transferred financial assets that is so favorable to the transferee that it is probable that the transferee will require the transferor to repurchase them. Transfers that do not meet the criteria to be accounted for as sales are accounted for as secured borrowings.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurement establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs of valuation techniques used to measure fair value. These three levels of fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:\n \u2022 Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date. \n \u2022 Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices in markets that are not active or quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. \n \u2022 Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable, reflecting the entity's own assumptions about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. \nA financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the assets or owes the liabilities rather than an entity specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities at the measurement date. We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. We also evaluate various factors to determine whether certain transactions are orderly and may make adjustments to transactions or quoted prices when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have decreased significantly.\nThe above conditions could cause certain assets and liabilities to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2 or Level 3 or reclassified from Level 2 to Level 3. The inputs or methodology used for valuing the assets or liabilities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with the assets and liabilities.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in the business combination. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual measurement dates at the reporting unit level. We have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative testing for impairment is necessary. The initial qualitative approach assesses whether the existence of events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than carrying value, the two step quantitative impairment test is performed. A step 1 analysis involves calculating the fair value of the associated reporting unit and comparing it to the reporting unit's carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, step 2 of the impairment test must be performed. Step 2 involves calculating and comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value. Impairment is recognized if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its net book value. Such loss is calculated as the difference between the estimated implied fair value of goodwill and its carrying amount.\nWe have intangible assets which have indefinite and definite lives. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's carrying value may not be fully recoverable, and are tested at least annually. An impairment loss, calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset, is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset is less than the corresponding carrying value. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets include a trade name and licenses and approvals.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of databases, customer relationships, trade names and affinity relationships. Our databases are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 10 years. Customer relationships are amortized over their useful lives of 3 to 15 years; amortizable trade names are amortized over the useful life of 3 years; and affinity relationships are amortized over their useful life of 10 years.\nIncome Taxes\nJGW LLC and the majority of its subsidiaries operate in the U.S. as non-tax paying entities, and are treated as disregarded entities for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes and generally as corporate entities in non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, certain of JGW LLC's wholly owned subsidiaries are operating as corporations within the U.S. and subject to U.S. federal and state tax. As non-tax paying entities, the majority of JGW LLC's net income or loss is attributable to its members and included in their tax returns. The current and deferred income tax provision (benefit) relates to both the income (loss) attributable to the Corporation from JGW LLC and to the tax-paying subsidiaries of JGW LLC.\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of the differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe analyze our tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state and local tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. If, based on this analysis, we determine that uncertainties in tax positions exist, a reserve will be established. We will recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the consolidated statements of operations.\nTax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and evaluating tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties under U.S. GAAP. Management reviews its tax positions periodically and adjusts its tax balances as new information becomes available.\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe qualify as an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and may opt to, rely on exemptions from certain financial disclosure requirements under U.S. GAAP that are applicable to other companies that are not emerging growth companies. We intend to take advantage of the\nbenefits of this extended transition period. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers which relates to how an entity recognizes the revenue it expects to be entitled to for the transfer of promised goods and services to customers. The ASU will replace certain existing revenue recognition guidance when it becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of the ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-13, Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity which relates to how an entity accounts for the financial assets and the financial liabilities of a consolidated collateralized financing entity at fair value. The ASU will allow an entity to elect to measure their financial assets and financial liabilities using either the measurement alternative provided under this ASU, which allows for the entity to measure both the financial assets and the financial liabilities of its collateralized financing entities in its consolidated financial statements using the more observable fair value of either the financial assets or financial liabilities, or under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2015 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern which requires management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The standard is effective for all entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Management does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis which requires an entity to re-evaluate its consolidation for limited partnerships or similar entities. The ASU requires an entity to apply this amendment using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The ASU changes the criteria that an entity uses to identify a variable interest entity, how it characterizes the VIE for a limited partnership or similar entity and how it determines the primary beneficiary. For public entities, the ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and for nonpublic entities beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs which relates to how an entity accounts for the recognition of debt issuance costs as a deferred charge. The ASU will require an entity to recognize debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2015 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The standard requires the new guidance to be adopted on a retrospective basis wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented will be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying this ASU. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments which relates to how and when the acquiring entity recognizes adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period. This ASU eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for these adjustments to their respective provisional amount with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2015 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016. Management does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes which requires an entity to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as concurrent in the classifies statement of financial position. For public entities, the ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and for all other entities beginning after\nDecember 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. Management does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Although the ASU retains many current requirements, it significantly revises an entity's accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017 and for all other entities beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases, at the commencement date of each lease. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments of this update should be applied using a modified retrospective approach, which requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors\u201d and the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements\u201d sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a diversified financial services company that specializes in providing solutions to consumers in need of cash. Our direct-to-consumer businesses use the internet, television, direct mailing, and other channels to offer a variety of solutions including structured settlement payment purchasing, mortgage origination (both purchase and refinancing), prepaid cards and access to personal lending. We warehouse, securitize, sell or otherwise finance the financial assets that we purchase in transactions that are structured to ultimately generate cash proceeds to us that exceed the purchase price we paid for those assets.\nWe currently operate our business through two business segments: (i) Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing and (ii) Home Lending. Our Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment provides liquidity to customers by purchasing structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams. Our Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment also includes prepaid card solutions, providing access to personal lending and funding for pre-settled legal claims as well as our corporate activities. Our Home Lending segment specializes in originating, selling and servicing residential mortgage loans.\nIn recent years we have focused on leveraging our brands, direct marketing capabilities and operational and underwriting capabilities to enter into new lines of business. We have executed on this strategy in 2015 through the acquisition of our mortgage lending business, J.G. Wentworth Home Lending, and the development of our prepaid card solutions and our platform for access to personal lending. As of December 31, 2015, our prepaid card solutions and personal lending platform were still in the nascent stage of development and had not generated significant revenues. Following this expansion, we are focusing on integration, stabilization and profitability, while also looking to grow our nascent lines of business.\n2015 Highlights\n \u2022 We executed on our strategy of becoming a more diversified company by acquiring Home Lending on July 31, 2015 and establishing the Home Lending segment. For the five months ended December 31, 2015, Home Lending originated approximately 3,300 mortgage loans totaling $843.2 million (inclusive of $0.3 million of mortgage-brokered origination activity) and generated $2.0 million in pre-tax income. \n \u2022 Our Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment reported a loss before income taxes of $217.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to income before income taxes of $117.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a $224.7 million decline in revenue and $121.6 million of impairment charges. In late 2015, we began to implement a series of transformation efforts to offset the challenges that resulted in the segment's disappointing results, including cost reduction activities that we anticipate will result in approximately $25 to $30 million in annual pre-tax cost savings, a restructuring of the purchasing organization, and a realignment of our marketing activities that together, we believe, will more appropriately size the business to the segment's current market conditions. \nResults of Operations\nComparison of Consolidated Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\n\n(1) Includes activity since the acquisition of Home Lending on July 31, 2015.\nThe change in our net (loss) income before income taxes was principally due to a $335.1 million decline in pre-tax income from our Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment that was the result of: (i) a $221.1 million decrease in realized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long term debt and derivatives driven by: (a) an unfavorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value our residual interest cash flows, (b) lower TRB purchases, and (c) a decrease in the current year's discount rate applied to TRB purchases, and (ii) the current year's impairment charges totaling $121.6 million to reduce the segment's goodwill and intangible assets to their respective fair values. Our Home Lending segment, which we acquired on July 31, 2015, generated pre-tax income of $2.0 million in the current year.\nWe recorded a consolidated income tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2015 of $18.2 million compared to a provision for income taxes of $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our overall effective tax rate was 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to an overall effective rate of 17.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The reduction in the overall effective tax rate was due primarily to the impact of the permanent differences between book and taxable income (loss), including the $121.6 million impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets recorded in 2015.\nThe net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interests represents the portion of (loss) earnings attributable to the economic interests in JGW LLC held by the non-controlling Common Interestholders. The $101.8 million net loss attributable to non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2015 represents the non-controlling interests' 48.3% weighted average economic interest in JGW LLC's net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $65.4 million net income attributable to non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2014 represents the non-controlling interests' 55.7% weighted average economic interest in JGW LLC's net income for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nComparison of Consolidated Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\n\nThe change in our net income before income taxes was primarily due to: (i) a $47.9 million increase in unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt and derivatives that was the result of a more favorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value our residual interest cash flows and (ii) a $14.5 million increase in interest income that resulted from an increase in our finance receivable balances. These increases were partially offset by a $13.9 million decrease in gain on extinguishment of debt, net.\nWe recorded a consolidated income tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2014 of $21.1 million compared to a provision for income taxes of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in our tax provision was primarily due to us owning an economic interest in JGW LLC for the entire 2014 fiscal year compared to the approximately 1.5 month period following our IPO during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nThe $65.4 million in net income attributable to non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2014 represents the non-controlling interests' 55.7% weighted average economic interest in JGW LLC's net income for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $67.4 million net income attributable to non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2013 represents the sum of: (i) 100% of the JGW LLC's net income for the period January 1, 2013 through November 13, 2013 (the date of our IPO) and (ii) the non-controlling interests' 62.1% weighted average economic interest in JGW LLC's net loss for the period November 13, 2013 through December 31, 2013.\nComparison of Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\n\nRevenues\nTotal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $269.6 million, a decrease of $224.7 million, or 45.5%, from revenues of $494.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $221.1 million decrease in unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt and derivatives and a $5.5 million increase in realized and unrealized losses on marketable securities.\nInterest income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was comprised of the following:\n\nThe $4.9 million increase in accretion income on finance receivables was primarily due to an increase in our average outstanding securitized finance receivables balance partially offset by a decrease in the average fair value discount rates used to calculate interest income on the associated securitized assets during the periods. The $1.3 million decrease in interest income on pre-settlement funding transaction receivables was due to a reduction in the associated VIE and other finance receivables resulting from management's decision to curtail purchases of such assets in April 2015.\nRealized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt, and derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was comprised of the following:\n\nThe $160.8 million change in unrealized gains (losses) on securitized finance receivables, debt and related derivatives was primarily the result of an unfavorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value our residual interest cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a favorable movement in the associated fair value interest rate during the year ended December 31, 2014. Specifically, the discount rate used to fair value our residual interests increased from 5.97% as of December 31, 2014 to 8.30% as of December 31, 2015 as result of the widening of spreads in the asset-backed securities market during 2015. In comparison, the discount rate used to fair value our residual interests decreased from 7.85% as of December 31, 2013 to 5.97% at December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of both the decrease in spreads in the asset-backed securities market and in long term interest rates in general during 2014; both of which are used in the calculation of the fair value discount rate used to estimate the fair value of our residual interest cash flows.\nTotal realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $60.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of the following: (i) approximately $45.2 million of the decrease was due to a decrease in the discount rate applied to TRB purchases, or purchase yield, as compared to the prior year coupled with an unfavorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value these assets during the respective periods, and (ii) approximately\n$15.2 million of the decrease was due to a $73.8 million decrease, or 7.0%, in guaranteed structured settlements, annuities and lotteries and life contingent structured settlements and annuities TRB purchases, from $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $976.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nA decrease in our purchase yield in isolation results in an increase in the purchase price of a structured settlement, annuity or lottery transaction which consequently results in a reduced realized or unrealized gain on unsecuritized finance receivables. During 2015, we experienced significant competitive pressure in the segment and despite efforts to increase purchase yields, our average purchase yield on guaranteed structured settlements (the largest component of our TRB purchases) decreased approximately 109 basis points in 2015 from the prior year.\nIn contrast to the impact of purchase yield on our revenues, an increase (decrease) in the fair value discount rate in isolation results in a decrease (increase) in the estimated fair value of the associated asset which consequently results in a reduced realized or unrealized gain on unsecuritized finance receivables. The weighted average discount rate used to fair value our unsecuritized guaranteed structured settlement finance receivables as of December 31, 2015 was 4.94%, 110 basis-points higher than the 3.84% weighted average discount rate used to fair value our unsecuritized guaranteed structured settlement finance receivables as of December 31, 2014. In contrast, the 3.84% weighted average discount rate used as of December 31, 2014 was 112 basis-points lower than the 4.96% weighted average discount rate used to fair value our guaranteed structured settlement finance receivables of December 31, 2013. The increase in the fair value discount rates used to discount our unsecuritized finance receivables during 2015 was attributable to the increase in the spreads in the asset-backed securities market, partially offset by a general decline in interest rates as evidenced by the yield on 10-year LIBOR swaps decreasing from an average of 2.7% in 2014 to 2.2% in 2015.\nRealized and unrealized (losses) gains on marketable securities, net, was a $4.6 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2015, an unfavorable change from the $0.9 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to lower investment returns on marketable securities. The decrease was primarily offset by a corresponding decrease in installment obligations (income) expense, net. These amounts relate to the marketable securities and installment obligations payable on our consolidated balance sheets. The marketable securities are owned by us but are held to fully offset our installment obligations liability. Therefore, increases or decreases in gains on marketable securities do not impact our net income.\nGain on extinguishment of debt, net, was $0.6 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 2015 gain resulted from the early repayment of the 2004-A securitization debt. The associated finance receivables were included in the 2015-1 securitization. In 2014, we repaid approximately $6.1 million of long-term debt issued by the 2002-A securitization and recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of $0.3 million.\nThe $2.1 million decrease in realized gains on notes receivable, at fair value resulted from the repayment of a note receivable during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $487.0 million, an increase of $110.4 million, or 29.3%, from expenses of $376.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAdvertising expense, which consists of our marketing costs including television, internet, direct mail and other related expenses, decreased to $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a $13.2 million decrease in our television spend that was partially offset by a $4.7 million net increase in our internet, direct mailing, and other advertising expenses. We continually assess the effectiveness of our advertising initiatives and adjust the timing, investment and advertising channels on an ongoing basis.\nInterest expense, which includes interest on our securitization and other VIE long-term debt, warehouse facilities and our term loan, increased by 3.1% to $207.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $200.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $6.3 million increase was primarily attributable to: (i) a $4.2 million increase in interest expense associated with our VIE securitized debt that resulted from an increase in the average outstanding balance between periods, partially offset by a decrease in the interest rate used to calculate interest expense and (ii) a $1.9 million increase in interest expense associated with our VIE long term debt that was principally due an increase in the average outstanding balance of our residual term debt and an increase and in the corresponding interest rate. In August 2015, we amended our residual term loan to increase the principal amount outstanding by $25.0 million to $133.0 million. In connection with the amendment, the interest rate increased from 7.00% to 7.25%.\nCompensation and benefits expense decreased to $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to (i) a $3.5 million decrease in incentive compensation expense and (ii) a $1.1 million reduction in share based compensation expense, which was partially offset by (a) a $1.0 million increase in severance expense related to the departure of several senior executives during the year ended 2015, including our former President and Chief Operating Officer, and (b) higher labor costs necessary to execute on our strategy of entering new lines of business and improving our information, data and analytic capabilities.\nProfessional and consulting costs increased to $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to $3.8 million in third-party fees incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of Home Lending and the reorganization of our structured settlement purchasing organization, partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in legal expense.\nThe decrease in debt issuance costs from the prior year was due to a $1.9 million reduction in underwriting fees resulting from the lower volume of securitized debt issued in the current year. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we issued approximately $475.9 million in securitized debt, a decrease of $193.1 million from the approximately $669.0 million in securitized debt issued in 2014. Underwriting fees associated with our securitizations are calculated as a percentage of the principal amount of debt issued.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we re-evaluated our projections for our Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment based on lower than anticipated results, a significant decline in the stock price of our Class A common stock, and a re-assessment of the reporting unit's brand strategy. Accordingly, we determined these events constituted a triggering event requiring us to test the goodwill and definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the 2011 acquisition of Orchard Acquisition Company, or OAC, for potential impairment. As a result of this analysis, we determined in the third quarter that the trade name within the reporting unit was impaired and recorded a $29.9 million impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test. The results of the analysis indicated an additional impairment of the trade name as well as an impairment of the goodwill within the reporting unit. Consequently, we recorded an additional impairment charge of $91.7 million in the fourth quarter comprised of the following: (i) an $85.0 million write-down of goodwill, (ii) an additional $5.6 million write-down of the indefinite-lived trade name, and (iii) and a $1.1 million write-down of other intangible assets. While we believe our assumptions used in the determination of the asset's fair value are reasonable, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Less than anticipated revenues generated by the remaining intangible assets, an increase in discount rates, and/or a decrease in our projected growth rates used in the discounted cash flow model could result in future impairment charges.\nComparison of Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\n\nRevenues\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $494.4 million, an increase of $34.8 million, or 7.6%, from revenues of $459.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.The increase was primarily attributable to a $47.9 million increase in unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt and derivatives and a $14.5 million increase in interest income. This was partially offset by a $14.4 million decrease in realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities, net, and a $13.9 million decrease in gain on extinguishment of debt, net.\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $187.0 million, an increase of $14.5 million, or 8.4%, from $172.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in our finance receivables balance.\nUnrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt, and derivatives was $300.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $47.9 million, or 18.9%, from $252.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily driven by a $42.6 million increase in unrealized gains on securitized finance receivables, debt and related derivatives, including our residual interest in securitized finance receivables, which resulted from a more favorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value our residual interest cash flows during the respective periods.\nRealized and unrealized gains on marketable securities, net, was $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease from a $15.3 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2013, due to lower investment returns on marketable securities. The decrease was primarily offset by a corresponding decrease in installment obligations expense, net. These amounts relate to the marketable securities and installment obligations payable on our consolidated balance sheets. The marketable securities are owned by us but are held to fully offset our installment obligations liability. Therefore, increases or decreases in gains on marketable securities do not impact our net income.\nGain on extinguishment of debt, net, was $0.3 million and $14.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2014, we repaid approximately $6.1 million of long-term debt issued by the 2002-A securitization and recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of $0.3 million. During 2013 and in connection with our 2013-3 securitization, we repaid approximately $64.0 million of long term debt issued by a permanent financing VIE and recorded a one-time gain on debt extinguishment of $22.1 million that was reduced by a debt prepayment penalty and hedge breakage costs totaling $7.9 million in aggregate.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $376.6 million, a decrease of $18.6 million, or 4.7%, from expenses of $395.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nAdvertising expense, which consists of our marketing costs including television, internet, direct mail and other related expenses, decreased to $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $70.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to the timing of our new internet and television advertising initiatives.\nInterest expense, which includes interest on our securitization debt, warehouse facilities and the term loan, increased by 4.0% to $200.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $193.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This $7.8 million increase was primarily driven by a $16.3 million increase in interest expense associated with our securitization debt that resulted from an increase in the average debt balances outstanding, partially offset by a $7.8 million decrease in the interest expense associated with our term loan resulting from a partial repayment in December 2013 and the associated amendment that reduced the term loan's coupon interest rate.\nCompensation and benefits expense decreased to $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $42.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of cost savings associated with the downsizing of our Boynton Beach office.\nGeneral and administrative costs decreased to $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to decreases of $1.5 million in rent and utilities and $0.5 million in information technology expense that resulted from the closing of our Boynton Beach office. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $1.0 million in insurance expense that was the result of additional insurance requirements associated with becoming a publicly-traded company.\nProvision for losses on finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased to $4.8 million from $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to a reduction in the provision for losses associated with pre-settlement funding transactions.\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased to $4.2 million from $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to certain intangible assets that arose in connection with the our merger with Orchard Acquisition Company, LLC and its subsidiaries in 2011 becoming fully amortized by the end of fiscal year 2013 and a decrease in the depreciation on fixed assets resulting from the downsizing of our Boynton Beach office.\nImpairment charges and loss on disposal of assets for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $4.2 million primarily due to the $4.0 million write-down of costs capitalized in conjunction with a software development project that we decided to discontinue in the fourth quarter of 2013.\nRestructuring Expense\nIn April 2013, we announced our intention to restructure our Boynton Beach office. In connection with this announcement, we recorded a restructuring charge of $3.6 million which was recorded in the following statement of operations line items: $2.9 million in compensation and benefits and $0.7 million in general and administrative. The associated workforce reductions were substantially completed as of December 31, 2013.\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net Income (Loss), a Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nWe use Adjusted Net Income (Loss), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of our results from operations, which we define as our net income (loss) under GAAP before non-cash compensation expenses, certain other non-routine expenses, provision for or benefit from income taxes and the amounts related to the consolidation of the securitization and permanent financing trusts we use to finance our business. We use Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as a measure of our overall performance because the operations of these variable interest entities do not impact the Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment's business performance. In addition, the add-backs described above are consistent with adjustments permitted under our term loan agreement.\nYou should not consider Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nA reconciliation of our (loss) income before income taxes as reported under GAAP to Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for our Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment was as follows:\n\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment reported Adjusted Net Loss of $1.4 million compared to Adjusted Net Income of $43.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The primary driver behind the $45.0 million unfavorable change was a $60.4 million decline in realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables which resulted from: (i) the combined effect of a decline in purchase yields and an increase in the fair value discount rates between periods, and (ii) a $73.8 million, or 7.0%, decrease in guaranteed structured settlements, annuities and lotteries and life contingent structured settlements and annuities TRB purchases. Partially offsetting the decrease in realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables was an $8.5 million decrease in advertising expense and a $1.9 million decrease in debt issuance costs from the prior year. As a result of these items, total expenses, after adjusting for the impact of the de-consolidation of the securitization entities, share-based compensation, income taxes, and other non-routine items decreased $10.6 million from the prior year.\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nAdjusted Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased $3.0 million to $43.6 million from $46.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $13.9 million decrease in gains on debt extinguishment, partially offset by a $10.7 million decrease in total expenses, after adjusting for the impact of the de-consolidation of the securitization entities, share-based compensation, income taxes, and other non-routine items. During 2013 and in connection with our 2013-3 securitization, we repaid approximately $64.0 million of long term debt issued by a permanent financing VIE and recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of $22.1 million that was reduced by a debt prepayment penalty and hedge breakage costs totaling $7.9 million in aggregate.\nHome Lending\nHome Lending Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe table below presents the results of operations for our Home Lending segment from July 31, 2015, the date of our acquisition, through December 31, 2015.\n\nKey Metrics\nKey operating statistics related to the origination and servicing of mortgage loans since the July 31, 2015 acquisition date were as follows:\n\nIn evaluating performance, we net gains on mortgage loans sold, unrealized gains on mortgage loans held for sale, interest rate lock commitments, or IRLCs, and associated derivative instruments (i.e., forward sales commitments to deliver mortgage loans and forwards sales of MBS) resulting from fair value mark-to-market adjustments, with direct costs such as fees paid to third parties to originate and sell the associated mortgage loans, and present it as realized and unrealized gains on sale of mortgage loans held for sale, net of direct costs in our consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated $20.5 million in gross revenue from the sale of mortgage loans and netted against it $1.9 million in direct costs.\nLoan origination fee income of $2.5 million represents revenue earned from originating mortgage loans and generally represents flat, per loan fee amounts.\nServicing, broker and other fees for the Home Lending segment represent revenue recognized for servicing mortgage loans for various investors that are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance. The primary driver of our servicing revenue is our MSR portfolio, which had an outstanding unpaid principal balance of $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2015, an increase of $212.4 million from the acquisition date.\nU.S. GAAP requires that MSRs initially be recorded at fair value at the time the underlying mortgage loans are sold with servicing rights retained. MSRs are subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting period. The increase (decrease) in the value of our MSR portfolio results from: (i) loans sold with servicing rights retained, (ii) the runoff of our MSR portfolio including payoffs, and (iii) changes in fair valuation inputs and assumptions are included in the changes in mortgage servicing rights, net in our consolidated statement of operations. From the date of acquisition through December 31, 2015, the fair value of our MSRs increased by approximately $1.6 million primarily due to the $212.4 million increase in the unpaid principal balance of our MSR portfolio.\nInterest income principally relates to our mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value which is accrued to income based on the principal amount outstanding and contractual interest rates.\nAdvertising expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 included approximately $0.7 million in costs associated with the re-branding of WestStar Mortgage Inc. as J.G. Wentworth Home Lending, Inc. (and ultimately J. G. Wentworth Home Lending, LLC) and the production costs for new television commercials that began to air in the third quarter of 2015.\nInterest expense represents interest on Home Lending's: (i) five warehouse credit facilities with various financial institutions used to originate mortgage loans held for sale that have a combined maximum borrowing capacity of $200.0 million; and (ii) an operating line of credit (collateralized by our MSRs) with a maximum borrowing capacity of $6.0 million.\nCompensation and benefits includes salaries for Home Lending employees, commissions paid to loan officers, applicable taxes and the cost of providing employee benefits.\nHome Lending's general and administrative expense primarily represents the cost to lease and operate the segment's headquarters in Woodbridge, Virginia and the various retail and direct lending call center offices across the country.\nThe provision for losses represents an estimate of losses to be incurred on the repurchase or indemnification of purchasers of mortgage loans. Certain sales contracts and GSE standards require us to repurchase a loan or indemnify the purchaser or insurer for losses if a borrower fails to make initial loan payments or if the accompanying mortgage loan fails to meet certain customary representations and warranties, such as the nature and extent of underwriting standards. In the event of a breach of the representations and warranties, we may be required to either repurchase the loan or indemnify the purchaser for losses it sustains on the loan. We record a provision for estimated repurchases and loss indemnification on loans sold, which is charged to the provision for losses.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income, a Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nWe use Adjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of Home Lending's results from operations, which we define as our net income under GAAP before non-cash compensation expenses, certain other non-routine expenses, and provision for or benefit from income taxes. We exclude these items in our calculation of Adjusted Net Income since we do not consider them part of our core operating results. In addition, these excluded items are consistent with adjustments permitted under our term loan agreement.\nYou should not consider Adjusted Net Income as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted Net Income may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nA reconciliation of our net income before income taxes as reported under GAAP to Adjusted Net Income for our Home Lending segment was as follows:\n\nQuarterly Financial Data\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.\n\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $125.7 million and $399.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The cash used in operating activities does not reflect the financing of our purchased receivables which is an integral part of our Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment and is reflected in net cash provided by financing activities. The $274.1 million decrease in the net cash used in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to: (i) a $155.1 million decrease related to changes in restricted cash and investments primarily due to the timing and structure of securitizations in the fourth quarters of 2015, 2014 and 2013, (ii) a $54.1 million decrease in purchases of finance receivables, (iii) a $27.0 increase in collections on finance receivables, (iv) a $24.6 million decrease resulting from the Home Lending segment's proceeds from the sale and principal payments on mortgage loans held for sale (net of originations and purchases of mortgages held for sale), and (v) a $21.9 million increase in net proceeds from the sale of finance receivables.\nUntil our 2015-3 securitization, our securitization transactions had historically been structured with an \"initial close\" in which we issued the principal amount of securitized debt and received: (i) cash in exchange for assets delivered and (ii) restricted cash in exchange for assets to be delivered 60 to 90 days in the future (referred to as the \"pre-funding\" date). On the pre-funding date, additional assets would be delivered to the lenders in return for the lifting of restrictions on the restricted cash. As a result\nof structuring the securitizations in this fashion, our restricted cash balances have fluctuated significantly depending on the timing of the transactions' initial close and their associated pre-funding dates.\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 included the impact of an $88.9 million increase in restricted cash that primarily related to the net effect of the following: (a) both 2013-3 securitization's initial-close and pre-funding occurring in the fourth quarter of 2013 and (b) our 2014-3 securitization's initial-close occurring in the fourth quarter of 2014 but the associated pre-funding occurring in the first quarter of 2015. As a result of the timing of the 2013-3 and 2014-3 pre-fundings, restricted cash increased $71.8 million between December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 included the impact of a $66.2 million decrease in restricted cash during the year that primarily related to the net effect of: (a) the timing of 2014-3 securitization's pre-funding discussed previously and (b) our 2015-3 securitization being structured with only an initial-close and not having an associated pre-funding. The impact of the timing and structure of the 2014-3 and 2015-3 securitizations was a $71.8 million decrease in our restricted cash balance between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015.\nCash Flow from Investment Activities\nNet cash used in investment activities was $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to net cash provided by investment activities of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $56.3 million change was primarily due to: (i) $47.4 million of net cash used to acquire our Home Lending segment in 2015 and (ii) the collection of a $6.1 million note receivable in 2014.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $191.9 million and $396.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The $204.7 million decrease was primarily attributable to a $280.7 million decrease in proceeds received from the issuance of securitization and other VIE long-term debt combined with a $10.0 million increase in purchases of treasury stock, partially offset by: (i) a $45.2 million increase in proceeds (net of repayments) from our revolving credit facilities, and (ii) a $38.1 million reduction in the repayment of securitization and other VIE long-term debt and derivatives.\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $399.8 million and $312.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The cash used in operating activities does not reflect the financing of our purchased receivables which is an integral part of our business and is reflected in the cash flow from financing activities. This $87.0 million increase was primarily driven by a $92.4 million increase in the change in restricted cash and investments due to the timing of our securitizations in the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013 and a $47.9 million increase in unrealized gains (losses) on VIE finance receivables, long-term debt and derivatives due to a more favorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value our residual interest cash flows during the respective periods. These increases in cash used in operating activities were partially offset by a $34.8 million increase in net income and a $21.8 million increase in gain on extinguishment of debt that resulted from the one-time gain on debt extinguishment we recorded in 2013 when we repaid a portion of long-term debt issued by a permanent financing VIE in connection with our 2013-3 securitization.\nCash Flow from Investment Activities\nNet cash provided by investment activities was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $4.5 million for the year ended 2013. The $1.3 million increase was primarily driven by a $3.6 million increase in receipts from notes receivable and a $0.8 million decrease in purchases of intangible and fixed assets, net of sales proceeds partially offset by the collection of a $5.2 million note receivable from an affiliate in the prior year. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2014 we received $2.1 million of cash in connection with the merger of one of our subsidiaries with and into JGW Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of JLL Fund V AIF II, L.P. with JGW Holdings, Inc. surviving the merger and becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary. Please refer to Note 2 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $396.6 million and $244.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, representing an increase of $152.4 million which was primarily attributable to a $171.2 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of VIE long-term debt and a $63.1 million decrease in repayments of warehouse facilities. These increases in cash provided by financing activities were partially offset by a $98.9 million decrease in gross proceeds from the revolving credit facility. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was also attributable to non-recurring transactions that occurred during 2013. In 2013, we entered into a new credit facility which generated net proceeds of $557.2 million. In connection with the entry into this new credit facility, we made a cash distribution of $459.6 million to Common Interestholders and made $143.5 million in repayments under our existing debt obligations. Additionally, the issuance of Class A common stock pursuant to our IPO in November 2013 generated net proceeds to us of $141.3 million, $123.0 million of which was used to repay a portion of our term loan and related fees.\nFunding Sources\nWe utilize a number of different funding sources to finance our segments and their associated business activities.\nStructured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing Segment\nStructured Settlements and Annuities\nWe finance our guaranteed structured settlement and annuity payment stream purchases with available cash and cash equivalents or through four separate warehouse facilities. As of December 31, 2015, these four warehouse facilities had $750.0 million of aggregate capacity which consisted of: (i) a $300.0 million syndicated warehouse facility with a revolving period that ends in July 2016; (ii) a $300.0 million warehouse facility with a revolving period that ends in November 2016; (iii) a $100.0 million warehouse facility with a 2 year evergreen feature that requires the lender to give us 24 months' notice prior to terminating the facility's revolving line of credit; and (iv) a $50.0 million warehouse facility with a revolving period that ends in October 2016. Subsequent to the expiration or termination of their respective revolving lines of credit, each of our warehouse facilities has an amortization period of between 18 and 24 months before the final maturity, allowing us time to exit or refinance the warehouse facility after the revolving period has ended. As of December 31, 2015, we had $710.8 million in total unused borrowings capacity under any of the four separate warehouse facilities used to finance our guaranteed structured settlement and annuity payment stream purchases.\nWe regularly assess our warehouse facilities and adjust the nature and amount of our committed warehouse lines in light of market conditions. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we terminated the $50.0 million warehouse facility and may seek to amend the remaining three warehouse facilities to better reflect our financing needs as we proceed through the annual renewal processes in 2016.\nOur warehouse facilities are structured with advance rates that range from 92.5% to 95.5% and discount rates that range from 7.3% to 9.2%. The discount rate is either fixed over the term of the facility or is based on a fixed spread over a floating swap rate, which we then fix through interest rate swaps at the time of the borrowing. The discount rate is used to discount the payment streams we have purchased, and these discounted payment streams are then multiplied by the advance rate to determine the amount of funds that are available to us under the warehouse facilities.\nWe have historically undertaken non-recourse term securitizations once we have aggregated in our warehouse facilities a sufficient aggregate value of structured settlement and annuity payment streams to undertake a securitization. At the close of each such securitization, the outstanding amount under each of the warehouse facilities is repaid. The amount of net proceeds we receive from securitizations is typically in excess of the amount of funds required to repay the warehouse facilities, resulting in a positive cash flow at the time of securitization. We completed three securitizations in 2015, 2014 and 2013. On March 31, 2015, we closed our 2015-1 securitization with an aggregate note issuance amount of $214.1 million and a deal discount rate of 3.64% which generated net proceeds to us of $128.0 million. On July 28, 2015, we closed our 2015-2 securitization with an aggregate note issuance amount of $158.5 million and a deal discount rate of 4.18%, which generated net proceeds to us of $73.5 million. On November 30, 2015, we closed our 2015-3 securitization with an aggregate note issuance amount of $103.3 million and a deal discount rate of 4.46% which generated net proceeds to us of $32.4 million.\nWe intend, subject to market conditions, management discretion and other relevant factors, to undertake multiple securitizations or other financing transactions per year in the future. Other forms of financing transactions we may utilize include direct asset sales in which we sell entire finance receivable pools to third-parties, as opposed to retaining residual interests in the\nassets as we have historically done in our securitizations. In late 2015, we completed a direct asset sale comprised of approximately $20.8 million in discounted TRB purchases based on a discount rate of 5.42% that generated $6.3 million in net proceeds to us. In February 2016 we also executed a direct asset sale of up to $161.3 million in discounted TRB purchases based on a discount rate of 5.02% consisting of two asset pools. The first pool closed on February 18, 2016, consisted of $91.3 million in discounted TRB purchases, and generated net proceeds to us of over $26 million. The second pool of up to $70.0 million is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016 and will generate additional cash at that time. Diversifying our financing strategy allows us to realize greater cost efficiencies in our capital market transactions and provides us with increased flexibility.\nThe counterparties to the structured settlement and annuity payment streams we purchase have mostly investment grade credit ratings. Approximately 71.2% of the counterparties to structured settlement payment streams that we purchased in 2015 were rated A3\u201d or better by Moody's. This reduced credit risk, together with the long weighted average life and low pre-payment risk, results in a desirable asset class that can be securitized and sold in the asset-backed security market or through outright-sale transactions.\nLife Contingent Structured Settlements and Life Contingent Annuities\nWe finance our purchases of life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams through a committed permanent financing facility with a capacity of $150.0 million. This facility allows us to purchase life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams without assuming any mortality risk. This facility is structured as a permanent facility, whereby the life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams we purchase are financed for their entire life and remain within the facility until maturity. The payment streams purchased are funded at a fixed advance rate of 94%, while the discount rate used to value the payment streams is variable, depending on the characteristics of the payment streams. The life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams that we purchase are discounted at a higher rate than the discount rates applied to those payment streams under the committed permanent financing facility, with the result that the funds available to be drawn under the facility exceed the purchase price for the payment streams we purchase. This positive cash flow is used to support our business and cover a portion of our operating expenses. As of December 31, 2015, our permanent financing facility had $79.8 million of unused capacity for our life contingent annuity and structured settlement businesses.\nLotteries\nBeginning in 2013, we have been purchasing lottery payment streams. We have structured two of our guaranteed structured settlement and annuity warehouse facilities to allow us to finance lottery payment streams. This allows us to aggregate a pool of such payment streams that we subsequently securitize together with structured settlement and annuity payment streams. Lottery payment streams were included in all of our securitizations during 2015, 2014 and 2013. We intend to continue to securitize and /or include in direct asset sales lottery payment streams in the future.\nHistorically, we have funded the purchase of lottery payment streams through non-recourse financing as well as a diversified institutional funding base of more than five institutional investors who purchase lottery payment streams directly from us. These investors are either insurance companies or asset managers. Lottery payment streams are purchased by the investors and the transactions are structured as an asset sale to the investor. We earn the difference between the discount rate at which we purchase the lottery payment stream from the lottery prizewinner and the discount rate at which we sell the lottery payment stream to the investor.\nPre-Settlement Funding\nWe previously financed our pre-settlement funding transactions through a revolving credit facility. The $35.0 million facility was structured with a revolving period that ended on December 31, 2015. The principal amount outstanding under the facility as of December 31, 2015 was converted into a \"term advance\" requiring minimum principal payments over the subsequent 24 month amortization period with interest payable monthly and calculated in the same manner as the original credit facility.\nWe decided, beginning in April 2015, to curtail our purchases of pre-settlement transactions. We have, however, and will continue to broker leads for such transactions to third parties in exchange for broker or referral fees. This change has not had a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.\nCredit Facility\nWe have (i) a widely syndicated senior secured term loan with a principal balance of $449.5 million as of December 31,\n2015 which matures in February 2019, and (ii) a $20.0 million revolving commitment that matures in August 2017. At each interest reset date, we have the option to elect that the senior secured term loan be either a Eurodollar loan or a Base Rate loan. If a Eurodollar loan, interest accrues at either Libor or 1.0% (whichever is greater) plus a spread of 6.0%. If a Base Rate loan, interest accrues at prime or 2.0% (whichever is greater) plus a spread of 5.0%. The revolving commitment has the same interest rate terms as the senior secured term loan. There are no principal payments due on the senior secured term loan until its maturity in February 2019.\nThe Credit Facility requires us, to the extent that as of the last day of any fiscal quarter there are outstanding balances on the revolving commitment that exceed specific thresholds (i.e., generally 15% of the $20.0 million borrowing capacity, or $3.0 million), to comply with a maximum total leverage ratio, as defined. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving commitment, and, as a result, the maximum total leverage ratio requirement was not applicable. Had the leverage ratio requirement been applicable as of December 31, 2015, we would not have satisfied the maximum total leverage ratio requirement and would have been required to repay the outstanding borrowings in excess of the specified threshold.\nResidual Financing\nOn August 13, 2015, we amended the terms of our Residual Term Facility. The amendment primarily increased the principal balance to $133.0 million from $108.0 million. This facility is now secured by the cash flows from our residual interests in 28 securitizations and is structured with a $133.0 million A1 Note due in May 2021. The amendment also increased the interest rate on the Residual Term Facility to 7.25% from 7.0%. The Residual Term Facility does not require minimum annual principal payments.\nSecuritization Debt\nWe elected fair value treatment under Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 825, Financial Instruments, to measure the VIE long-term debt issued by securitization and permanent financing trusts and related VIE finance receivables. We have determined that measurement of the VIE long-term debt issued by securitization and permanent financing trusts at fair value better correlates with the fair value of the VIE finance receivables held by special purpose entities, or SPEs, which are held to provide the cash flow for the note obligations. The VIE debt issued by SPEs is non-recourse to us or our subsidiaries. Certain of our subsidiaries continue to receive fees for servicing the securitized assets which are eliminated in consolidation. In addition, the risk to our non-SPE subsidiaries from SPE losses is limited to cash reserve and residual interest amounts.\nOther Financing\nWe maintain other permanent financing arrangements that have been used in the past for longer term funding purposes. Each of these arrangements has assets pledged as collateral, the cash flows from which are used to satisfy the loan obligations. These other financing arrangements are more fully described in Notes 19 and 20 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nHome Lending Segment\nMortgage Loans Held For Sale\nWe finance our mortgage loan origination activities primarily through five separate warehouse facilities with an aggregate capacity of $200.0 million as of December 31, 2015. Subsequent to year-end, we expanded our borrowing facilities and the current aggregate borrowing capacity to $235.0 million. These credit facilities are generally renewed annually for a period of twelve months and represent secured lending facilities with our originated mortgage loans serving as collateral. In addition, our lenders require pledge fund deposits of approximately one percent of the facility's capacity be maintained with the lender. Without these facilities we would not be able to meet our short-term liquidity requirements to operate our Home Lending segment.\nOur Home Lending segment typically holds its mortgage loan inventory for 30-45 days with these warehouse facilities until the loans are sold to take-out investors or securitized directly with Ginnie Mae or Fannie Mae, at which time the amount outstanding with the warehouse facilities are repaid.\nThese warehouse facilities are used strictly to fund the origination of mortgage loans. Our ability to fund current operations depends upon our ability to secure these types of short-term financings on acceptable terms and to renew or replace the financings as they expire.\nOperating Line of Credit\nWe maintain a $6.0 million line of credit with a financial institution that is generally renewed annually for a period of twelve months and represents a secured lending facility with our MSRs serving as collateral.\nConsolidated Liquidity Needs\nShort-Term Liquidity Needs\nOur liquidity needs over the next 12 months are expected to be provided through: (i) cash generated from the purchase and subsequent securitization and other financing of structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams, and (ii) cash generated from our Home Lending segment's operations. Additionally, we may consider the financing of other uncollateralized assets such as our residual interests from recent securitizations that were not financed via the Residual Term Facility. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to securitize our payment streams or securitize/sell our mortgage loans at favorable rates, or obtain financing through borrowing or other means.\nLong-Term Liquidity Needs\nOur most significant needs for liquidity beyond the next 12 months are the repayment of the principal and interest amounts of our outstanding senior secured term loan and the repayment of our residual financing facility. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs through excess cash flow generated through our securitization program, bank borrowings, debt refinancings, and new debt and equity offerings. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to securitize our payment streams at favorable rates or obtain financing through borrowing or other means, refinance our debt or raise new debt or equity.\nAs a consequence of the initial sales and any future exchanges of Common Interests for shares of our Class A common stock or Class C common stock, we may increase our share of the tax basis of the assets then owned by JGW LLC. Any such increase in tax basis is anticipated to allow us the ability to reduce the amount of future tax payments to the extent that we have future taxable income. We are obligated, pursuant to our tax receivable agreement with all Common Interestholders who held in excess of approximately 1% of the Common Interests as of immediately prior to our IPO, to pay to such Common Interestholders, 85% of the amount of income tax we save for each tax period as a result of the tax benefits generated from the initial sales and any subsequent exchange of Common Interests for our Class A common stock or Class C common stock and from the use of certain tax attributes. We expect to fund these long-term requirements under the tax receivable agreement with tax distributions received from JGW LLC and, if necessary, loans from JGW LLC.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments (excluding interest rate swaps which are discussed in Derivatives and Other Hedging Instruments\u201d) as of December 31, 2015, and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. The table also reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding debt based on scheduled and/or expected repayment dates and the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2015. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as referenced in the table:\n\n (a) Included in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereof. \n (b) In July 2015 and in connection with the Home Lending Acquisition, the credit facility was modified to permit mortgage financing indebtedness. Associated with this amendment we paid $0.2 million of consulting fees and incurred approximately $0.7 million in consent fees which were deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the modified debt as an adjustment to interest expense. No principal payments are due on the term loan until the date of maturity. Total outstanding borrowings under the new senior secured credit facility was $449.5 million as of December 31, 2015. \n (c) Certain of our contractual obligations and commitments are funded through cash flows from certain VIE finance receivables included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n (d) On August 13, 2015, we amended the terms of our Residual Term Facility. The amendment primarily increased the principal balance from $108.0 million to $133.0 million. This facility is now secured by the cash flows from our residual interests in 28 securitizations and is structured with a $133.0 million A1 Note due in May 2021. The amendment also increased the interest rate on the Residual Term Facility to 7.25% from 7.0%. The Residual Term Facility does not require minimum annual principal payments. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn establishing accounting policies within the framework of U.S. GAAP, management must make certain assessments, estimates, and choices that will result in the application of these principals in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies and estimates that we consider to be critical.\nConsolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The J.G. Wentworth Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest, and those variable interest entities where our wholly-owned subsidiaries are the primary beneficiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nIn the normal course of business, we are involved with various entities that are considered to be VIEs. A VIE is an entity that has either a total investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest under the voting interest model of consolidation. We are required to consolidate any VIE if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has the power to direct those activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses from or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We review all significant interests in the VIEs we are involved with including consideration of the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance and whether we have control over those activities. On an ongoing basis, we assess whether or not we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE.\nAs a result of adopting ASC 810, Consolidations, we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIEs used to securitize our finance receivables ( VIE finance receivables\u201d). We elected the fair value option with respect to assets and liabilities in our securitization VIEs as part of their initial consolidation on January 1, 2010.\nThe debt issued by our securitization VIEs is reported on our consolidated balance sheets as VIE long-term debt issued by securitization and permanent financing trusts, at fair value ( VIE securitization debt\u201d). The VIE securitization debt is recourse solely to the VIE finance receivables held by such SPEs thus is non-recourse to us and other consolidated subsidiaries. The VIEs will continue in operation until all securitization debt is paid and all residual cash flows are collected. Most consolidated VIEs have expected lives in excess of 20 years.\nWe acquire receivables associated with structured settlement payments from individuals in exchange for cash, and these receivables are carried at fair value. Unearned income is calculated as the amount the fair value exceeds the cost basis of the receivables. Unearned income on structured settlements is recognized as interest income using the effective interest method over the life of the related structured settlement. Changes in fair value are recorded in unrealized gains on finance receivables, long- term debt and derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe, through our subsidiaries, sell finance receivables to SPEs. An SPE issues notes secured by undivided interests in the receivables. Payments due on these notes generally correspond to receipts from the receivables in terms of the timing of payments due. We retain an interest in the SPEs and are deemed to have control over these SPEs due to our servicing or subservicing role and therefore consolidate these SPEs.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when the following conditions have been satisfied: (1) the transferred assets have been isolated from the Company, beyond the reach of the Company and its creditors; (2) the transferee obtains the right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets; and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity, or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets or through an agreement that permits the transferee to require the transferor to repurchase the transferred financial assets that is so favorable to the transferee that it is probable that the transferee will require the transferor to repurchase them. Transfers that do not meet the criteria to be accounted for as sales are accounted for as secured borrowings.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurement establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs of valuation techniques used to measure fair value. These three levels of fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:\n \u2022 Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date. \n \u2022 Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices in markets that are not active or quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. \n \u2022 Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable, reflecting the entity's own assumptions about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. \nA financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the assets or owes the liabilities rather than an entity specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities at the measurement date. We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. We also evaluate various factors to determine whether certain transactions are orderly and may make adjustments to transactions or quoted prices when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have decreased significantly.\nThe above conditions could cause certain assets and liabilities to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2 or Level 3 or reclassified from Level 2 to Level 3. The inputs or methodology used for valuing the assets or liabilities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with the assets and liabilities.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in the business combination. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual measurement dates at the reporting unit level. We have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative testing for impairment is necessary. The initial qualitative approach assesses whether the existence of events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than carrying value, the two step quantitative impairment test is performed. A step 1 analysis involves calculating the fair value of the associated reporting unit and comparing it to the reporting unit's carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, step 2 of the impairment test must be performed. Step 2 involves calculating and comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value. Impairment is recognized if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its net book value. Such loss is calculated as the difference between the estimated implied fair value of goodwill and its carrying amount.\nWe have intangible assets which have indefinite and definite lives. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's carrying value may not be fully recoverable, and are tested at least annually. An impairment loss, calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset, is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset is less than the corresponding carrying value. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets include a trade name and licenses and approvals.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of databases, customer relationships, trade names and affinity relationships. Our databases are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 10 years. Customer relationships are amortized over their useful lives of 3 to 15 years; amortizable trade names are amortized over the useful life of 3 years; and affinity relationships are amortized over their useful life of 10 years.\nIncome Taxes\nJGW LLC and the majority of its subsidiaries operate in the U.S. as non-tax paying entities, and are treated as disregarded entities for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes and generally as corporate entities in non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, certain of JGW LLC's wholly owned subsidiaries are operating as corporations within the U.S. and subject to U.S. federal and state tax. As non-tax paying entities, the majority of JGW LLC's net income or loss is attributable to its members and included in their tax returns. The current and deferred income tax provision (benefit) relates to both the income (loss) attributable to the Corporation from JGW LLC and to the tax-paying subsidiaries of JGW LLC.\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of the differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe analyze our tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state and local tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. If, based on this analysis, we determine that uncertainties in tax positions exist, a reserve will be established. We will recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the consolidated statements of operations.\nTax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and evaluating tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties under U.S. GAAP. Management reviews its tax positions periodically and adjusts its tax balances as new information becomes available.\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe qualify as an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and may opt to, rely on exemptions from certain financial disclosure requirements under U.S. GAAP that are applicable to other companies that are not emerging growth companies. We intend to take advantage of the\nbenefits of this extended transition period. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers which relates to how an entity recognizes the revenue it expects to be entitled to for the transfer of promised goods and services to customers. The ASU will replace certain existing revenue recognition guidance when it becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of the ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-13, Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity which relates to how an entity accounts for the financial assets and the financial liabilities of a consolidated collateralized financing entity at fair value. The ASU will allow an entity to elect to measure their financial assets and financial liabilities using either the measurement alternative provided under this ASU, which allows for the entity to measure both the financial assets and the financial liabilities of its collateralized financing entities in its consolidated financial statements using the more observable fair value of either the financial assets or financial liabilities, or under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2015 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern which requires management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The standard is effective for all entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Management does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis which requires an entity to re-evaluate its consolidation for limited partnerships or similar entities. The ASU requires an entity to apply this amendment using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The ASU changes the criteria that an entity uses to identify a variable interest entity, how it characterizes the VIE for a limited partnership or similar entity and how it determines the primary beneficiary. For public entities, the ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and for nonpublic entities beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs which relates to how an entity accounts for the recognition of debt issuance costs as a deferred charge. The ASU will require an entity to recognize debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2015 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The standard requires the new guidance to be adopted on a retrospective basis wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented will be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying this ASU. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments which relates to how and when the acquiring entity recognizes adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period. This ASU eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for these adjustments to their respective provisional amount with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2015 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016. Management does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes which requires an entity to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as concurrent in the classifies statement of financial position. For public entities, the ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and for all other entities beginning after\nDecember 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. Management does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Although the ASU retains many current requirements, it significantly revises an entity's accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017 and for all other entities beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases, at the commencement date of each lease. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments of this update should be applied using a modified retrospective approach, which requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_tables": "Table 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>296,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>494,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(198,009\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>511,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income before income taxes\n</td> <td>(215,356\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(333,109\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(282.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Benefit) provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>(18,216\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39,356\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(186.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>(197,140\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(293,753\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(304.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>(101,828\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(167,230\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(255.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income attributable to The J.G.

decreased 40.1% to $296.4 million in 2015 compared to $494.4 million in 2014, primarily due to lower realized and unrealized gains on finance receivables in the Structured Settlements and Annuity Purchasing segment. \n\n- Net loss was $197.1 million in 2015 compared to net income of $96.6 million in 2014. The loss was mainly driven by a $221.1 million decrease in unrealized gains on finance receivables in the Structured Settlements segment, as well as $121.6 million in impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets.\n\n- In July 2015, the company acquired J.G. Wentworth Home Lending which contributed $26.7 million in revenue and $2.0 million in pre-tax income in 2015.\n\n- The Structured Settlements segment reported a pre-tax loss of $217.3 million in 2015 compared to pre-tax income of $117.8 million in 2014, primarily due to lower realized and unrealized gains on finance receivables. \n\n- The company took impairment charges of $121.6 million in 2015 related to goodwill and intangible assets in the Structured Settlements segment due to lower projected revenues.\n\n- Total TRB purchases decreased 8.4% to $987.6 million in 2015 compared to $1,077.8 million in 2014.\n\n- The company relies on securitizations, credit facilities, and other borrowings to finance operations and acquisitions. It completed 3 securitizations in 2015.\n\nIn summary, the company reported a large net loss in 2015 driven by the Structured Settlements segment, partially offset by the new Home Lending segment. Impairment charges also contributed to the loss."}
