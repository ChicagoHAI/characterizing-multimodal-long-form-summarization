Central Federal is a community-oriented financial institution founded in 1952, dedicated to serving the financial service needs of customers within its market area, which generally consists of Phelps County, Missouri, although it also services customers in the contiguous Missouri countries of Dent, Texas, Crawford, Pulaski and Maries. We currently operate out of our office in Rolla, Missouri.\nWe offer a variety of loan and deposit products to meet the borrowing needs of our customers. Our real estate loans consist primarily of residential loans, including owner-occupied and non-owner occupied one-to four-family residential loans. We also offer commercial and multi-family real estate loans, commercial business loans and consumer loans, including automobile and recreational vehicle loans. We are subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC, our primary federal regulator, and the FDIC, our deposit insurer. The Company is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\nWe will continue to explore ways to service our customers and their needs in order to be a full service banking institution. The results of our operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on interest-earning assets, primarily loans, and interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, consisting of deposits. The interest income we generate is based on the origination of commercial, mortgage and consumer loans. Our primary source of funding is deposits. The largest expenses we incur are associated with salaries and related employee benefits. It is critical for Central Federal to maintain appropriate regulatory leverage and risk-based capital ratios.\nOperating Strategy\nBuilding on our strengths as a community-oriented financial institution. We have operated continuously as a community-oriented financial institution since we were founded in 1952. We are committed to meeting the financial needs of our local community and are dedicated to providing quality personal service to our customers. In that regard, we are focused on building our customer base in the communities we serve through the enhancement of our products and additional marketing of these products and services. Further, we have provided our customers the opportunity to become shareholders through our stock offering.\nIncreasing loan production while maintaining our asset quality. Our loan portfolio has slightly declined over the past few years in our very competitive market area. Through additional marketing and perhaps the addition of more lending personnel, we hope to grow our loan portfolio. In growing the loan portfolio, we will seek to maintain strong asset quality by following prudent underwriting guidelines and utilizing our knowledge of our local market area.\nStrengthening our capital to protect against rising interest rates. We currently have a strong capital base which is sufficient for interest rate risk purposes in the current low interest rate environment given our interest rate risk profile. We know if interest rates rise, having a strong capital base will provide us with additional strength to withstand the impact of rising interest rates. Further, the cash generated from the conversion could be used to fund loans or purchase investment securities at higher interest rate levels should interest rates rise, providing additional net interest income.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term include the determination of the allowance for loan losses, valuation of foreclosed assets, and valuation of deferred tax assets.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is an estimate made by management as necessary to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense. Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after loan losses and loan growth. Loan losses are charged-off against the allowance when Central Federal determines the loan balance to be uncollectible. Cash received on previously charged-off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance. Although management believes the allowance to be adequate, ultimate losses may vary from its estimates. At least quarterly, the board of directors reviews the adequacy of the allowance, including consideration of the relevant risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions, and other factors. If the board of directors and management determine that changes are warranted based on those reviews, the allowance is adjusted. In addition, Central Federal's primary regulator may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available at the time of their examinations. The regulatory agency is not, however, directly involved in the determination of the allowance for loan losses, and any decisions to increase or decrease the allowance for loan losses are the responsibility of Central Federal's management.\nForeclosed Assets. Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets held for sale are carried at the lower of the new cost basis or fair value less costs to sell. This evaluation is inherently subjective and requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available. Due to potential changes in conditions, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in fair values will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nDeferred Tax Assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. These calculations are based on many complex factors including estimates of the timing of reversals of temporary differences, the interpretation of federal and state income tax laws, and a determination of the differences between the tax and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates and interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax liabilities.\nThe Company maintains significant net deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences, the largest of which relates to the Company's contribution to establish the Central Federal Community Foundation. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not\u201d that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon management's judgment and evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, including the forecasts of future income,\ntax planning strategies and assessments of the current and future economic and business conditions. The Company considers both positive and negative evidence regarding the ultimate realizability of the deferred tax assets. Positive evidence includes the ability to implement tax planning strategies to accelerate taxable income recognition and the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods. Negative evidence includes the continued expenses related to operating as a publicly traded company, current financial performance, and the general business and economic trends.\nIn connection with the offering of common stock, the Company contributed to the Central Federal Community Foundation $100,000 in cash and common stock with a fair value of approximately $688,000 (68,770 shares at the $10.00 offering price) for a total contribution of approximately $788,000. For Federal income tax purposes, the deduction for charitable contributions is limited to a maximum of 10% of taxable income before charitable contributions, net operating losses and dividends received deductions. We are permitted, under the Internal Revenue Code, to carry the excess contribution over the five-year period following the contribution to the charitable foundation, subject to the 10% annual limitation.\nWe may not have sufficient taxable income to be able to fully deduct the contribution in the year in which it is made or during the five-year carryover period permitted under the Internal Revenue Code. We estimate we will not be able to fully utilize the carryover, and we established a valuation allowance related to the entire deferred tax asset related to the contribution as it is not deemed to be realizable. This determination was based primarily upon the effect of anticipated costs related to operation as a publicly traded company and their effect on future taxable income. The creation of the valuation allowance does not have an effect on the Company's cash flows and may be recoverable in subsequent periods if the Company were to realize certain sustainable future taxable income. It is possible that future conditions may differ substantially from those anticipated in determining the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and adjustments may be required in the future.\nDetermining the ultimate settlement of any tax position requires significant estimates and judgements in arriving at the amount of tax benefits to be recognized in the financial statements. It is possible that the tax benefits realized upon the ultimate resolution of a tax position may result in tax benefits that are significantly different from those estimated.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nOverview. We had a net loss of\u2009 $873,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to net income, for Central Federal only, of\u2009 $69,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $942,000, or 1,365.2%, decrease in net income between the years was primarily a result of the foundation charitable contribution. Net interest income increased $219,000 and noninterest expense increased $1.3 million, due to the $788,000 contribution and an increase of\u2009 $376,000 for legal and professional fees related to outside consulting fees paid due to lack of a chief financial officer for the first half of 2016 and costs as a new public company.\nNet Interest Income. The following table presents a summary of net interest income before provision for loan losses.\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Components of net interest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans, Including Fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,302 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(48) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.09)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities and Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>233 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>242.65 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(102) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22.13) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(102) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22.13) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,128 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,909 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.47% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet interest income increased by $219,000, or 11.5%, to $2,128,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $1,909,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Although interest income on loans decreased by $48,000 from the year ended December 31, 2015, to the year ended December 31, 2016, the interest\nincome generated by the investment portfolio increased $165,000 over the prior year, and interest expense decreased by $102,000 during that same period. Securities and other interest income consists of interest on bank accounts, securities available for sale, certificates of deposits, federal funds sold and dividends on FHLB Stock.\nThe decrease in interest income on loans is primarily the result of a 10 basis point decrease in the yield on the loan portfolio.\nThe decrease in interest expense on deposits was due primarily to a decrease in the average rate on deposits of 27 basis points. The average balance of certificates of deposit decreased by $3.9 million and the average balance of interest-bearing DDA accounts increased by $7.8 million. This change in deposit mix contributed to a further decline in deposit costs.\nAverage Balances and Yields. The following table presents information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends from average interest-earning assets, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, and the resulting annualized average yields and costs. The yields and costs for the years indicated are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the years presented. Average balances have been calculated using daily balances, and non-accrual loans are included in average balances only. Loan fees are included in interest income on loans and are insignificant. Any adjustments necessary to present yields on a tax-equivalent basis are insignificant.\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>

The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. Changes attributable to changes in both rate and volume have been allocated proportionally based on the absolute dollar amounts of changes in each.

We maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level necessary to absorb management's best estimate of probable loan losses in the portfolio. Management reviews the level of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis based on a variety of factors. Management considers, among other factors, historical loss experience, type and amount of loans, borrower concentrations and current conditions of the economy. In addition, the allowance considers the level of loans which management monitors as a result of inconsistent repayment patterns. Such loans carry a higher degree of credit risk than our historical single-family lending.\nManagement also reviews individual loans for which full collectability may not be reasonably assured and considers, among other matters, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. This evaluation is ongoing and results in variations in our provision for loan losses.\nWe had no provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2016, nor was there a provision for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net loan recoveries amounted to $2,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to net charge offs of\u2009 $18,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAlthough management utilizes its best judgment in providing for losses, there can be no assurance that they will not have to change its allowance for loan losses in subsequent periods. The allowance for loan losses reflects the estimate we believe to be appropriate to cover incurred probable losses in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2016. While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, such estimates and assumptions could be proven incorrect in the future, and the actual amount of future provisions may exceed the amount of past provisions, and the increase in future provisions that may be required may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our primary regulator may comment during an examination on the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs. The regulatory agency is not, however, directly involved in the determination of the allowance for loan losses, and any decisions to increase or decrease the allowance for loan losses are the responsibility of Central Federal's management. Management will continue to monitor the allowance for loan losses and make additional provisions to the allowance as appropriate.\nAn analysis of the changes in the allowance for loan losses, non-performing loans and classified loans is presented under Allowance for Loan Losses, Analysis of Non-Performing Assets and Troubled Debt Restructurings, and Classified Assets below.\nNoninterest Income. Total noninterest income decreased by $12,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This was a result of customer service fees decreasing $5,000 and other non-interest income decreasing by $7,000.\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customer service fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.62)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36.84) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.11)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest Expenses. Total noninterest expenses increased by $1.3 million, or 65.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $788,000 contribution made to the Central Federal Community Foundation during the year ended December 31, 2016. Legal and professional services expense increased by $376,000 from year to year due to higher professional fees incurred as a public company and certain one-time events, including legal costs incurred for establishment of the ESOP and outside consulting fees paid due to lack of a CFO for half of the year. At this time, we do not expect this trend in legal and professional fees to continue. In addition, data processing and outside services increased by $17,000 from year to year attributable to IT and network expenses, the expense to introduce chip card technology and increases in data processing costs.\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation and employee benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.79% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data Processing and other outside services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.80 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FDIC insurance and regulatory assessmenet\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.00) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy and Equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>212 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.36) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal and Professional Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>376 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>383.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Supplies, Telephone, and Postage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.63 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operations of Foreclosed Assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contribution to Charitable Foundation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65.76% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM\u2009-\u2009Not meaningful\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). We had an income tax benefit of\u2009 $59,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to an income tax expense of\u2009 $44,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. This is due to a loss before income taxes of\u2009 $932,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to income before income taxes of\u2009 $113,000 during the same period in 2015. In 2016, we established a valuation allowance of\u2009 $236,000 on the entire deferred tax asset related to the contribution to the Central Federal Community Foundation of\u2009 $788,000 as it is not deemed to be realizable.\nBalance Sheet Analysis as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nTotal Assets. At December 31, 2016, total assets were $74.0 million, a decrease of\u2009 $6.9 million, or 8.5%, from total assets of\u2009 $80.9 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in total assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due mainly to the net effect of a $12.8 million, or a 51.2%, decrease in cash and cash equivalents while investments increased $6.1 million with the receipt of funds generated in the conversion of Central Federal to stock form. The decrease in other assets relates to the deferral of stock conversion costs of\u2009 $1.4 million at December 31, 2015.\nLoans. The largest portion of our loan portfolio consists of residential real estate loans which totaled $33.0 million, or 66.6%, and $31.7 million, or 63.2%, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Residential real estate loans increased by $1.3 million, or 4.1%, during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCommercial and multi-family real estate loans totaled $14.4 million and represented 29.2% of total loans at December 31, 2016. This is a decrease of\u2009 $1.7 million, or 10.5%, from $16.1 million, or 32.1% of total loans, at December 31, 2015. The market area served by Central Federal is very competitive and\ninterest rate sensitive. Commercial real estate loans generally consist of loans secured by multi-family residential rentals, retail stores, and other commercial real estate.\nCommercial business loans totaled $1.5 million and $2.0 million, comprising 3.1% and 3.9% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Commercial business loans decreased $408,000, or 20.9%, during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nConsumer and other loans increased by $140,000, or 33.5%, from $418,000 at December 31, 2015 to $558,000 at December 31, 2016.\nLoan Portfolio Composition.

The average life of loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments. In addition, due-on-sale clauses on loans generally give us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and, conversely, decrease when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially lower than rates on existing mortgage loans.\nLoan Activity.

Our primary sources of loan originations are existing customers, walk-in traffic, advertising and referrals from customers.\nWe did not sell any loans during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. From time to time we do buy participation loans. We did not purchase any loans during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses (allowance) is an estimate of probable loan losses in Central Federal's loan portfolio. The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense. Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after loan losses and loan growth. Loan losses are charged-off against the allowance when Central Federal determines the loan balance to be uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.\nGeneral Allowances. The general component of the loan loss allowance covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical losses adjusted for current qualitative factors. The historical loss component is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced by Central Federal over the most recent three years. This is adjusted for qualitative factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These qualitative factors include: (i) changes in the value of underlying collateral; (ii) changes in lending policies and underwriting practices; (iii) national and local economic trends and conditions; (iv) volume and terms of loans; (v) experience, ability and depth of lending management; (vi) changes in past due loans, nonaccrual loans, and credit quality; (vii) changes in loan file review; (viii) changes in credit concentrations and (ix) the impact of competition.\nSpecific Allowances. The specific component includes allowances for loans that are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that Central Federal will be unable to collect the scheduled payments and principal or interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Central Federal measures individual impairment based on the present value of expected future\ncash flows discounted at the original contractual interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, it may measure impairment based on an observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral, if collateral dependent. A loan is collateral dependent if the repayment is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral.\nUnallocated Allowances. Allowances other than general and specific allocations are included in the unallocated portion of the loan loss allowance. The unallocated allowance reflects the imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating the general allowance.\nAt December 31, 2016, the allowance was $263,000 and represented 0.5% of total loans. At December 31, 2015, the allowance was $261,000 and also represented 0.5% of total loans. At December 31, 2016, the largest allowance in the portfolio was the allowance for residential real estate loans, which made up about 68.9% of the total allowance at $181,000, and at December 31, 2015, the largest allowance in the portfolio was the allowance for residential real estate loans, which made up about 70.1% of the total allowance at $183,000.\nThe following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated. The allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in each category.\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\nAllowance\nto Total\nAllowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\nLoans in\nCategory to\nTotal Loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\nAllowance\nto Total\nAllowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\nLoans in\nCategory to\nTotal Loans\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial Business\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and Multi-Family\nReal Estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.2% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.5% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential Real Estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68.9% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.6% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63.2% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer and Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total allocated allowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85.2% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated allowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.8% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total allowance for loan loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>261 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2016, our allowance for loan losses of\u2009 $263,000 was 132.2% of non-performing loans. At December 31, 2015, our allowance for loan losses of\u2009 $261,000 was 33.5% of non-performing loans.\nAlthough we believe that we use the best available information to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and our results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. At least quarterly, the board of directors reviews the adequacy of the allowance, including consideration of the relevant risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions and other factors. If the board of directors and management determine that changes are warranted based on those reviews, the allowance is adjusted.\nFurthermore, while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and have taken into account the views of regulators and the current economic environment, there can be no assurance that in the future Central Federal's regulators will not require further increases in the allowance. The regulatory agency is not, however, directly involved in the determination of the allowance for loan losses, and any decisions to increase or decrease the allowance for loan losses are the responsibility of Central Federal's management. Any material increases in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nAnalysis of Loan Loss Experience.

The increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to $1,000 in charge-offs offset with $3,000 in recoveries. Charge-offs were minimal in 2016 with the largest charge-off being $1,000 in consumer loans. In 2015, the largest charge-off was for $17,000. The allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans ratio increased due to a decrease in non-performing loans to $199,000 as of December 31, 2016 from $779,000 as of December 31, 2015. Non-performing loans decreased due primarily to a commercial real estate loan which was paid off during 2016. The allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans as of December 31, 2016 increased by 0.01% to 0.53% compared to 0.52% as of December 31, 2015.\nDelinquencies.

Our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk, interest rate risk and market risk. Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or the principal balance of a loan when it is due. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of\ninterest income and/or the potential increase of interest expense as a result of changes in interest rates. Market risk reflects changes in the value of collateral underlying loans receivable and the valuation of real estate held by Central Federal. Other risks that we face are operational risk, liquidity risks and reputation risk. Operational risks include risks related to fraud, regulatory compliance, processing errors, technology, use of third-party vendors and disaster recovery. Liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors, lenders or potential borrowers. Reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press, whether true or not, could cause a decline in our customer base or income.\nAnalysis of Non-Performing Assets and Troubled Debt Restructurings. We consider foreclosed assets, which are assets repossessed by Central Federal, accruing loans 90 days or more past due and non-accrual loans to be non-performing assets. Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are considered foreclosed assets and are held for sale. These assets are initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure, which establishes a new cost basis for those assets. Any write-downs based on the asset's fair value at the date of foreclosure, or subsequent to the date of foreclosure, are charged to the allowance for loan losses. The assets held for sale are carried at the lower of the new cost basis or fair value less costs to sell.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when the collectability is considered to be uncertain or payments have become more than 90 days or more delinquent, unless the credit is well-secured and in process of collection. In some cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. Credit card loans and other personal loans are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. As of December 31, 2016, there were three loans on non-accrual status totaling $199,000, which is a decrease of\u2009 $480,000, from the two loans on non-accrual status amounting to $679,000 as of December 31, 2015. Nonaccrual loans for those periods represented .4% and 1.4% of total loans, respectively.\nUnder certain circumstances, Central Federal will provide borrowers relief through loan restructuring. A restructuring of debt constitutes a TDR if Central Federal, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial situation, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise have considered. Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment. Depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower, restructuring loans can involve loans remaining in full nonaccrual, moving to nonaccrual or continuing on accrual status.\nThe following table provides information with respect to our non-performing assets and accruing troubled debt restructurings at the dates indicated.\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-accrual loans: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer and Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accruing loans 90 days or more past due: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer and other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate owned\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>608 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accruing troubled debt restructurings (TDR): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing and accruing troubled debt restructurings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Ratios: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing loans to total loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.40% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.55% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing assets to total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.30% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.71% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing loans and accruing TDRs to total loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.40% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.55% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing assets and accruing TDRs to total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.30% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.71% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal non-performing loans decreased by $580,000 from $779,000 at December 31, 2015 to $199,000 at December 31, 2016. The majority of this change was due to a $390,000 commercial real estate loan which was paid off during 2016.\nForeclosed assets at December 31, 2016 consisted of one property totaling $26,000, which is a decrease from the three foreclosed properties at December 31, 2015 which totaled $608,000. The decline in the total amount of foreclosed assets is due primarily to three properties being sold. The first sale was for a property sold in Cuba, Missouri for $267,000, resulting in a gain of\u2009 $2,000. The second sale was a property sold in Rolla, Missouri for $91,000, at a gain of\u2009 $18,000. During the process of the second sale, the property was separated into 2 distinct properties. The third property was sold for $209,000, resulting in a loss of\u2009 $34,000.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had no loans which were not classified as nonaccrual, 90 days past due or troubled debt restructurings but where known information about possible credit problems of the borrowers caused management to have concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and which may result in the future inclusion of such items in non-performing loans.\nThe following table provides information with respect to partial charge-offs on non-performing loans and accruing troubled debt restructurings at the dates indicated.\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less partially charged off non-performing loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted non-performing loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing loans and accruing troubled debt restructurings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted non-performing loans and accruing troubled debt restructurings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted non-performing loans to total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted non-performing loans and accruing troubled debt restructurings to total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses to adjusted non-performing loans and accruing troubled debt\nrestructurings at end of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>132.2% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.5% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nClassified Assets. Central Federal assigns a risk rating to loans and foreclosed assets to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of the assets. These risk ratings are also subject to examination by Central Federal's regulators. We categorize the assets based on the financial condition of the borrowers, trends in the industries in which the borrower operates and the fair values of collateral securing the loans and foreclosed assets.\nLoans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. If left uncorrected, this potential weakness may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of Central Federal's credit position at some future date. Special mention loans are not adversely classified and do not expose Central Federal to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. Loans classified as substandard are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the repayment of the debt. Well-defined weaknesses include a borrower's lack of marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction on time, or the failure to fulfill economic expectations. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that Central Federal will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Special mention\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Substandard </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>613 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total criticized and classified loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreclosed assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>608 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total criticized and classified assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>760 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Portfolio. Our board of directors has the overall responsibility for the investment portfolio, including approval of the investment policy. Our primary investment objectives are: (i) to provide and maintain liquidity; (ii) to fully employ the available funds of Central Federal; (iii) to earn an average rate of return on invested funds competitive with comparable institutions; (iv) to manage interest rate risk; and (v) to limit credit and interest rate risk. Our chief executive officer is responsible for the implementation of our policy and monitoring our investment performance. Our board of directors reviews the status of our investment portfolio on a monthly basis.\nWe have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored agencies and of state and municipal governments, mortgage-backed securities and certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions. Within certain\nregulatory limits, we also may invest a portion of our assets in other permissible securities. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, we also are required to maintain an investment in the stock of that institution.\nThe following table sets forth the amortized costs and fair values of our available-for-sale securities at the dates indicated.\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amortized Cost\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amortized Cost\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Investments available-for-sale: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage Backed Securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,321 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Small Business Administration Pools\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>954 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Municipal Obligation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>403 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.

The increase is a result of purchasing several short-term certificates of deposit to provide a higher return than the overnight earnings rate; provided rate increases occur as projected, the cash flow will be reinvested at higher rates as they mature.\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Weighted\nAverage Rate\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Certificates of Deposit in Other Financial Institutions Maturing In: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,488 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.16% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.76 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.64% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities available-for-sale\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,581 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to our investment portfolio, at December 31, 2016 we held $97,000 of Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines stock, carried at cost.\nDeposits. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. Deposits generally are attracted from within our market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including non-interest-bearing demand deposits (such as checking accounts), interest-bearing demand deposit accounts (such as NOW and money market accounts), statement savings accounts, and certificates of deposit.

The higher balance at December 31, 2015 stemmed from the receipt of subscriptions in advance of the conversion of Central Federal to stock form, which were maintained during December 2015 in a deposit account at Central Federal. Interest-bearing demand deposits make up the majority of the deposit balance, accounting for $20.6 million, or 44.6%, and $18.8 million, or 28.2%, as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Non-interest bearing demand deposits decreased by $18.4 million due primarily to deposits held for subscriptions related to the company's stock conversion, being transferred to the holding company or invested. Savings accounts remained consistent.\nCertificates of deposits, specifically those less than $250,000, decreased by $3.3 million as a number of certificates matured in 2016. The follow table provides information regarding all of our certificates of deposit by time remaining until maturity as of December 31, 2016.\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td> Maturity Period at December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Three months or less\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over three months through six months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over six months through one year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over one year through three years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over three years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,684 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table indicates the amount of certificates of deposits with balances of\u2009 $100,000 or greater by time remaining until maturity as of December 31, 2016.\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td> Maturity Period at December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Three months or less\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>893 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over three months through six months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over six months through twelve months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over twelve months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nStockholders' Equity. Stockholders' equity increased by $14.1 million, or 103.3%, to $27.8 million at December 31, 2016 from $13.7 million at December 31, 2015 as the result of the conversion of Central Federal from a federally chartered mutual savings association into a federally chartered stock savings association and the related sale of common stock, which was completed on January 12, 2016. The proceeds from the sale of common stock in the subscription were the main source of the increase in stockholders' equity. As described above, the Company had a net loss of\u2009 $873,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity Management\nLiquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. Our primary sources of funds available to meet short-term liquidity needs consist of deposits, funds from scheduled loan payments, loan prepayments, and income on earning assets. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition.\nOur most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits, and securities available for sale. At December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled $12.2 million. Certificates of deposits in other financial institutions and securities available-for-sale totaled $4.7 million and $6.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016.\nOur cash flows are composed of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $ 40,000 and $715,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of activity in securities available-for-sale and loans, was $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and net cash provided by investing activities was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash used in financing activities, consisting of activity in deposit accounts and proceeds from sale of common stock, was $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities was $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCertificates of deposit maturing over the next 12 months total $12.3 million, or 65.6%, of certificates of deposits. Although we generally manage the pricing of our deposits to be competitive, management understands that if these maturing deposits are not reinvested or do not stay with Central Federal, we will be required to seek other sources of funding or rely on new certificates of deposit. If these deposits are withdrawn, it is anticipated that they would be funded with available cash or replaced with deposits from other customers. Federal Home Loan Bank or Federal Reserve Bank borrowings or proceeds from the sale of securities could also be used to replace unanticipated outflows of deposits.\nCapital Management\nWe are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the OCC, including risk-based capital measures. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At December 31, 2016, we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements, and were considered well capitalized\u201d under regulatory guidelines, with Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets ratio of 27.0%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 52.9%, a total-risk based capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 53.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 52.9%. Refer to Note 15 to the accompanying Notes to the Financial Statements.\nThe capital from the offering of Central Federal Bancshares common stock in connection with the conversion of Central Federal to stock form will significantly increase our liquidity and capital resources in future periods. Over time, the initial level of liquidity will be reduced as net proceeds from the stock offering are used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of lending activities. Our financial condition and results of operations will be enhanced by the capital from the offering, resulting in increased net interest-earning assets and net interest income. However, the large increase in equity resulting from the capital raised in the offering will, initially, have an adverse impact on our return on equity, and under OCC regulations, we were not allowed to repurchase any shares during the first year following the offering, unless extraordinary circumstances existed and we received regulatory approval.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. In the normal course of business, Central Federal has outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which are not included in the accompanying financial statements. Central Federal's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. Central Federal had $2.8 million in unfunded commitments under lines of credit, and no standby letters of credit, as of December 31, 2016. Unfunded commitments under lines of credit were $5.6 million and standby letters of credit were $15,000 as of December 31, 2015.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend a customer as long as there is no violation of any conditions established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Central Federal evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case by case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by Central Federal upon extension of credit, is based on management credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, and income producing commercial property.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by Central Federal to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Central Federal's policy for obtaining collateral, and the nature of such collateral, is essentially the same as that involved in making commitments to extend credit. Central Federal was not required to perform on any financial guarantees and did not incur any losses on its commitments.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nAs a result of our banking activities, we are exposed to interest rate risk. As a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit our exposure to changes in market interest rates. We manage interest rate sensitivity of our interest-bearing liabilities and interest-earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment.\nA major source of interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets as compared to the repricing of liabilities. Deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturity of deposits. As a result, sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect our earnings. We seek to reduce the potential volatility of our earnings by continually improving the matching between our asset and liability maturities and rates.\nCentral Federal's goal is to manage asset and liability positions to moderate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our earnings, while also controlling exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by our board of directors. These limits and guidelines reflect Central Federal's tolerance for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons.\nNet Portfolio Value. We currently utilize economic value of equity analysis to review our level of interest rate risk. We measure our interest rate risk through the use of a financial model provided by an outside consulting firm. This model measures interest rate risk by capturing changes in the economic value of assets and liabilities, based on a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. Economic value represents the market value of our assets and liabilities. These analyses assess the risk of loss in market risk-sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained 100 to 400 basis point increase or 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement.\nThe following table presents the change in the economic value of our equity at December 31, 2016 that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates based on assumptions we consider to be reasonable, with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counteract that change.\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> EVE as a Percentage of\nPresent Value of Assets(3)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in Interest\nRates\n(basis points)(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Estimated\nAmount(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Estimated Increase\n(Decrease) in EVE\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> EVE\nRatio(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n(basis points)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +400\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,504) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.85) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.09% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(61) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +300\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,629 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,505) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(661) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.13) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(101) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.48) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.70 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(598) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.83) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(133) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\nAssumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.\n(2)\nEVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts.\n(3)\nPresent value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets.\n(4)\nEVE Ratio represents EVE divided by the present value of assets.\nWe use various assumptions in assessing interest rate risk. These assumptions relate to interest rates, loan prepayment rates, deposit decay rates and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios, among others. As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analysis presented in the foregoing table. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgage loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, if there is a change in interest rates, expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. Prepayment rates can have a significant impact on interest income. Because of the large percentage of loans we hold, rising or falling interest rates have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of our earning assets that in turn affect the rate sensitivity position. When interest rates rise, prepayments tend to slow. When interest rates fall, prepayments tend to rise. Our asset sensitivity would be reduced if prepayments slow and vice versa. While we believe these assumptions to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future loan repayment activity.\nImpact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,\u201d an amendment to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. This amendment supersedes the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories, requires equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income, and simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The amendment requires public business entities that are required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet to measure that fair value using the exit price notion. The amendment requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total\nchange in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option. The amendment requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. The amendment reduces diversity in current practice by clarifying that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available for sale securities in combination with the entity's other deferred tax assets. This amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities should apply the amendment by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, with the exception of the amendment related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. The Company intends to adopt the accounting standard during the first quarter of 2018, as required, and is currently evaluating the impact of implementation.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments\u2009-\u2009Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The ASU requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. Additionally, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. For the Company, this update will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company has not yet determined the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on the consolidated financial statements.\nEffect of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe financial statements and related financial data presented in this prospectus have been prepared according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial positions and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and service.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nThe Company is a holding company that owns 100% of Central Federal. Central Federal is a community-oriented financial institution founded in 1952, dedicated to serving the financial service needs of customers within its market area, which generally consists of Phelps County, Missouri, although it also services customers in the contiguous Missouri countries of Dent, Texas, Crawford, Pulaski and Maries. We currently operate out of our office in Rolla, Missouri.\nWe offer a variety of loan and deposit products to meet the borrowing needs of our customers. Our real estate loans consist primarily of residential loans, including owner-occupied and non-owner occupied one-to four-family residential loans. We also offer commercial and multi-family real estate loans, commercial business loans and consumer loans, including automobile and recreational vehicle loans. We are subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC, our primary federal regulator, and the FDIC, our deposit insurer. The Company is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\nWe will continue to explore ways to service our customers and their needs in order to be a full service banking institution. The results of our operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on interest-earning assets, primarily loans, and interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, consisting of deposits. The interest income we generate is based on the origination of commercial, mortgage and consumer loans. Our primary source of funding is deposits. The largest expenses we incur are associated with salaries and related employee benefits. It is critical for Central Federal to maintain appropriate regulatory leverage and risk-based capital ratios.\nOperating Strategy\nBuilding on our strengths as a community-oriented financial institution. We have operated continuously as a community-oriented financial institution since we were founded in 1952. We are committed to meeting the financial needs of our local community and are dedicated to providing quality personal service to our customers. In that regard, we are focused on building our customer base in the communities we serve through the enhancement of our products and additional marketing of these products and services. Further, we have provided our customers the opportunity to become shareholders through our stock offering.\nIncreasing loan production while maintaining our asset quality. Our loan portfolio has slightly declined over the past few years in our very competitive market area. Through additional marketing and perhaps the addition of more lending personnel, we hope to grow our loan portfolio. In growing the loan portfolio, we will seek to maintain strong asset quality by following prudent underwriting guidelines and utilizing our knowledge of our local market area.\nStrengthening our capital to protect against rising interest rates. We currently have a strong capital base which is sufficient for interest rate risk purposes in the current low interest rate environment given our interest rate risk profile. We know if interest rates rise, having a strong capital base will provide us with additional strength to withstand the impact of rising interest rates. Further, the cash generated from the conversion could be used to fund loans or purchase investment securities at higher interest rate levels should interest rates rise, providing additional net interest income.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term include the determination of the allowance for loan losses, valuation of foreclosed assets, and valuation of deferred tax assets.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is an estimate made by management as necessary to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense. Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after loan losses and loan growth. Loan losses are charged-off against the allowance when Central Federal determines the loan balance to be uncollectible. Cash received on previously charged-off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance. Although management believes the allowance to be adequate, ultimate losses may vary from its estimates. At least quarterly, the board of directors reviews the adequacy of the allowance, including consideration of the relevant risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions, and other factors. If the board of directors and management determine that changes are warranted based on those reviews, the allowance is adjusted. In addition, Central Federal's primary regulator may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available at the time of their examinations. The regulatory agency is not, however, directly involved in the determination of the allowance for loan losses, and any decisions to increase or decrease the allowance for loan losses are the responsibility of Central Federal's management.\nForeclosed Assets. Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets held for sale are carried at the lower of the new cost basis or fair value less costs to sell. This evaluation is inherently subjective and requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available. Due to potential changes in conditions, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in fair values will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nDeferred Tax Assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. These calculations are based on many complex factors including estimates of the timing of reversals of temporary differences, the interpretation of federal and state income tax laws, and a determination of the differences between the tax and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates and interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax liabilities.\nThe Company maintains significant net deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences, the largest of which relates to the Company's contribution to establish the Central Federal Community Foundation. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not\u201d that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon management's judgment and evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, including the forecasts of future income,\ntax planning strategies and assessments of the current and future economic and business conditions. The Company considers both positive and negative evidence regarding the ultimate realizability of the deferred tax assets. Positive evidence includes the ability to implement tax planning strategies to accelerate taxable income recognition and the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods. Negative evidence includes the continued expenses related to operating as a publicly traded company, current financial performance, and the general business and economic trends.\nIn connection with the offering of common stock, the Company contributed to the Central Federal Community Foundation $100,000 in cash and common stock with a fair value of approximately $688,000 (68,770 shares at the $10.00 offering price) for a total contribution of approximately $788,000. For Federal income tax purposes, the deduction for charitable contributions is limited to a maximum of 10% of taxable income before charitable contributions, net operating losses and dividends received deductions. We are permitted, under the Internal Revenue Code, to carry the excess contribution over the five-year period following the contribution to the charitable foundation, subject to the 10% annual limitation.\nWe may not have sufficient taxable income to be able to fully deduct the contribution in the year in which it is made or during the five-year carryover period permitted under the Internal Revenue Code. We estimate we will not be able to fully utilize the carryover, and we established a valuation allowance related to the entire deferred tax asset related to the contribution as it is not deemed to be realizable. This determination was based primarily upon the effect of anticipated costs related to operation as a publicly traded company and their effect on future taxable income. The creation of the valuation allowance does not have an effect on the Company's cash flows and may be recoverable in subsequent periods if the Company were to realize certain sustainable future taxable income. It is possible that future conditions may differ substantially from those anticipated in determining the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and adjustments may be required in the future.\nDetermining the ultimate settlement of any tax position requires significant estimates and judgements in arriving at the amount of tax benefits to be recognized in the financial statements. It is possible that the tax benefits realized upon the ultimate resolution of a tax position may result in tax benefits that are significantly different from those estimated.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nOverview. We had a net loss of  $873,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to net income, for Central Federal only, of  $69,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $942,000, or 1,365.2%, decrease in net income between the years was primarily a result of the foundation charitable contribution. Net interest income increased $219,000 and noninterest expense increased $1.3 million, due to the $788,000 contribution and an increase of  $376,000 for legal and professional fees related to outside consulting fees paid due to lack of a chief financial officer for the first half of 2016 and costs as a new public company.\nNet Interest Income.

Although interest income on loans decreased by $48,000 from the year ended December 31, 2015, to the year ended December 31, 2016, the interest\nincome generated by the investment portfolio increased $165,000 over the prior year, and interest expense decreased by $102,000 during that same period. Securities and other interest income consists of interest on bank accounts, securities available for sale, certificates of deposits, federal funds sold and dividends on FHLB Stock.\nThe decrease in interest income on loans is primarily the result of a 10 basis point decrease in the yield on the loan portfolio.\nThe decrease in interest expense on deposits was due primarily to a decrease in the average rate on deposits of 27 basis points. The average balance of certificates of deposit decreased by $3.9 million and the average balance of interest-bearing DDA accounts increased by $7.8 million. This change in deposit mix contributed to a further decline in deposit costs.\nAverage Balances and Yields. The following table presents information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends from average interest-earning assets, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, and the resulting annualized average yields and costs. The yields and costs for the years indicated are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the years presented. Average balances have been calculated using daily balances, and non-accrual loans are included in average balances only. Loan fees are included in interest income on loans and are insignificant. Any adjustments necessary to present yields on a tax-equivalent basis are insignificant.\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>

We maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level necessary to absorb management's best estimate of probable loan losses in the portfolio. Management reviews the level of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis based on a variety of factors. Management considers, among other factors, historical loss experience, type and amount of loans, borrower concentrations and current conditions of the economy. In addition, the allowance considers the level of loans which management monitors as a result of inconsistent repayment patterns. Such loans carry a higher degree of credit risk than our historical single-family lending.\nManagement also reviews individual loans for which full collectability may not be reasonably assured and considers, among other matters, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. This evaluation is ongoing and results in variations in our provision for loan losses.\nWe had no provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2016, nor was there a provision for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net loan recoveries amounted to $2,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to net charge offs of  $18,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAlthough management utilizes its best judgment in providing for losses, there can be no assurance that they will not have to change its allowance for loan losses in subsequent periods. The allowance for loan losses reflects the estimate we believe to be appropriate to cover incurred probable losses in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2016. While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, such estimates and assumptions could be proven incorrect in the future, and the actual amount of future provisions may exceed the amount of past provisions, and the increase in future provisions that may be required may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our primary regulator may comment during an examination on the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs. The regulatory agency is not, however, directly involved in the determination of the allowance for loan losses, and any decisions to increase or decrease the allowance for loan losses are the responsibility of Central Federal's management. Management will continue to monitor the allowance for loan losses and make additional provisions to the allowance as appropriate.\nAn analysis of the changes in the allowance for loan losses, non-performing loans and classified loans is presented under Allowance for Loan Losses, Analysis of Non-Performing Assets and Troubled Debt Restructurings, and Classified Assets below.\nNoninterest Income. Total noninterest income decreased by $12,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This was a result of customer service fees decreasing $5,000 and other non-interest income decreasing by $7,000.\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customer service fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.62)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36.84) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.11)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest Expenses. Total noninterest expenses increased by $1.3 million, or 65.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $788,000 contribution made to the Central Federal Community Foundation during the year ended December 31, 2016. Legal and professional services expense increased by $376,000 from year to year due to higher professional fees incurred as a public company and certain one-time events, including legal costs incurred for establishment of the ESOP and outside consulting fees paid due to lack of a CFO for half of the year. At this time, we do not expect this trend in legal and professional fees to continue. In addition, data processing and outside services increased by $17,000 from year to year attributable to IT and network expenses, the expense to introduce chip card technology and increases in data processing costs.\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation and employee benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.79% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data Processing and other outside services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.80 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FDIC insurance and regulatory assessmenet\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.00) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy and Equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>212 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.36) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal and Professional Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>376 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>383.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Supplies, Telephone, and Postage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.63 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operations of Foreclosed Assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contribution to Charitable Foundation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65.76% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM - Not meaningful\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). We had an income tax benefit of  $59,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to an income tax expense of  $44,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. This is due to a loss before income taxes of  $932,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to income before income taxes of  $113,000 during the same period in 2015. In 2016, we established a valuation allowance of  $236,000 on the entire deferred tax asset related to the contribution to the Central Federal Community Foundation of  $788,000 as it is not deemed to be realizable.\nBalance Sheet Analysis as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nTotal Assets. At December 31, 2016, total assets were $74.0 million, a decrease of  $6.9 million, or 8.5%, from total assets of  $80.9 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in total assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due mainly to the net effect of a $12.8 million, or a 51.2%, decrease in cash and cash equivalents while investments increased $6.1 million with the receipt of funds generated in the conversion of Central Federal to stock form. The decrease in other assets relates to the deferral of stock conversion costs of  $1.4 million at December 31, 2015.\nLoans. The largest portion of our loan portfolio consists of residential real estate loans which totaled $33.0 million, or 66.6%, and $31.7 million, or 63.2%, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Residential real estate loans increased by $1.3 million, or 4.1%, during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCommercial and multi-family real estate loans totaled $14.4 million and represented 29.2% of total loans at December 31, 2016. This is a decrease of  $1.7 million, or 10.5%, from $16.1 million, or 32.1% of total loans, at December 31, 2015. The market area served by Central Federal is very competitive and\ninterest rate sensitive. Commercial real estate loans generally consist of loans secured by multi-family residential rentals, retail stores, and other commercial real estate.\nCommercial business loans totaled $1.5 million and $2.0 million, comprising 3.1% and 3.9% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Commercial business loans decreased $408,000, or 20.9%, during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nConsumer and other loans increased by $140,000, or 33.5%, from $418,000 at December 31, 2015 to $558,000 at December 31, 2016.\nLoan Portfolio Composition.

The average life of loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments. In addition, due-on-sale clauses on loans generally give us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and, conversely, decrease when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially lower than rates on existing mortgage loans.\nLoan Activity.

Our primary sources of loan originations are existing customers, walk-in traffic, advertising and referrals from customers.\nWe did not sell any loans during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. From time to time we do buy participation loans. We did not purchase any loans during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses (allowance) is an estimate of probable loan losses in Central Federal's loan portfolio. The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense. Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after loan losses and loan growth. Loan losses are charged-off against the allowance when Central Federal determines the loan balance to be uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.\nGeneral Allowances. The general component of the loan loss allowance covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical losses adjusted for current qualitative factors. The historical loss component is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced by Central Federal over the most recent three years. This is adjusted for qualitative factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These qualitative factors include: (i) changes in the value of underlying collateral; (ii) changes in lending policies and underwriting practices; (iii) national and local economic trends and conditions; (iv) volume and terms of loans; (v) experience, ability and depth of lending management; (vi) changes in past due loans, nonaccrual loans, and credit quality; (vii) changes in loan file review; (viii) changes in credit concentrations and (ix) the impact of competition.\nSpecific Allowances. The specific component includes allowances for loans that are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that Central Federal will be unable to collect the scheduled payments and principal or interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Central Federal measures individual impairment based on the present value of expected future\ncash flows discounted at the original contractual interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, it may measure impairment based on an observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral, if collateral dependent. A loan is collateral dependent if the repayment is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral.\nUnallocated Allowances. Allowances other than general and specific allocations are included in the unallocated portion of the loan loss allowance. The unallocated allowance reflects the imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating the general allowance.\nAt December 31, 2016, the allowance was $263,000 and represented 0.5% of total loans. At December 31, 2015, the allowance was $261,000 and also represented 0.5% of total loans. At December 31, 2016, the largest allowance in the portfolio was the allowance for residential real estate loans, which made up about 68.9% of the total allowance at $181,000, and at December 31, 2015, the largest allowance in the portfolio was the allowance for residential real estate loans, which made up about 70.1% of the total allowance at $183,000.\nThe following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated. The allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in each category.\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\nAllowance\nto Total\nAllowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\nLoans in\nCategory to\nTotal Loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\nAllowance\nto Total\nAllowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\nLoans in\nCategory to\nTotal Loans\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial Business\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and Multi-Family\nReal Estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.2% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.5% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential Real Estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68.9% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.6% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63.2% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer and Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total allocated allowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85.2% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated allowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.8% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total allowance for loan loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>261 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2016, our allowance for loan losses of  $263,000 was 132.2% of non-performing loans. At December 31, 2015, our allowance for loan losses of  $261,000 was 33.5% of non-performing loans.\nAlthough we believe that we use the best available information to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and our results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. At least quarterly, the board of directors reviews the adequacy of the allowance, including consideration of the relevant risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions and other factors. If the board of directors and management determine that changes are warranted based on those reviews, the allowance is adjusted.\nFurthermore, while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and have taken into account the views of regulators and the current economic environment, there can be no assurance that in the future Central Federal's regulators will not require further increases in the allowance. The regulatory agency is not, however, directly involved in the determination of the allowance for loan losses, and any decisions to increase or decrease the allowance for loan losses are the responsibility of Central Federal's management. Any material increases in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nAnalysis of Loan Loss Experience.

The increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to $1,000 in charge-offs offset with $3,000 in recoveries. Charge-offs were minimal in 2016 with the largest charge-off being $1,000 in consumer loans. In 2015, the largest charge-off was for $17,000. The allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans ratio increased due to a decrease in non-performing loans to $199,000 as of December 31, 2016 from $779,000 as of December 31, 2015. Non-performing loans decreased due primarily to a commercial real estate loan which was paid off during 2016. The allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans as of December 31, 2016 increased by 0.01% to 0.53% compared to 0.52% as of December 31, 2015.\nDelinquencies.

Our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk, interest rate risk and market risk. Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or the principal balance of a loan when it is due. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of\ninterest income and/or the potential increase of interest expense as a result of changes in interest rates. Market risk reflects changes in the value of collateral underlying loans receivable and the valuation of real estate held by Central Federal. Other risks that we face are operational risk, liquidity risks and reputation risk. Operational risks include risks related to fraud, regulatory compliance, processing errors, technology, use of third-party vendors and disaster recovery. Liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors, lenders or potential borrowers. Reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press, whether true or not, could cause a decline in our customer base or income.\nAnalysis of Non-Performing Assets and Troubled Debt Restructurings. We consider foreclosed assets, which are assets repossessed by Central Federal, accruing loans 90 days or more past due and non-accrual loans to be non-performing assets. Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are considered foreclosed assets and are held for sale. These assets are initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure, which establishes a new cost basis for those assets. Any write-downs based on the asset's fair value at the date of foreclosure, or subsequent to the date of foreclosure, are charged to the allowance for loan losses. The assets held for sale are carried at the lower of the new cost basis or fair value less costs to sell.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when the collectability is considered to be uncertain or payments have become more than 90 days or more delinquent, unless the credit is well-secured and in process of collection. In some cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. Credit card loans and other personal loans are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. As of December 31, 2016, there were three loans on non-accrual status totaling $199,000, which is a decrease of  $480,000, from the two loans on non-accrual status amounting to $679,000 as of December 31, 2015. Nonaccrual loans for those periods represented.4% and 1.4% of total loans, respectively.\nUnder certain circumstances, Central Federal will provide borrowers relief through loan restructuring. A restructuring of debt constitutes a TDR if Central Federal, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial situation, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise have considered. Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment. Depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower, restructuring loans can involve loans remaining in full nonaccrual, moving to nonaccrual or continuing on accrual status.\nThe following table provides information with respect to our non-performing assets and accruing troubled debt restructurings at the dates indicated.\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-accrual loans: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer and Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accruing loans 90 days or more past due: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer and other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate owned\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>608 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accruing troubled debt restructurings (TDR): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing and accruing troubled debt restructurings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Ratios: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing loans to total loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.40% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.55% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing assets to total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.30% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.71% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing loans and accruing TDRs to total loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.40% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.55% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing assets and accruing TDRs to total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.30% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.71% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal non-performing loans decreased by $580,000 from $779,000 at December 31, 2015 to $199,000 at December 31, 2016. The majority of this change was due to a $390,000 commercial real estate loan which was paid off during 2016.\nForeclosed assets at December 31, 2016 consisted of one property totaling $26,000, which is a decrease from the three foreclosed properties at December 31, 2015 which totaled $608,000. The decline in the total amount of foreclosed assets is due primarily to three properties being sold. The first sale was for a property sold in Cuba, Missouri for $267,000, resulting in a gain of  $2,000. The second sale was a property sold in Rolla, Missouri for $91,000, at a gain of  $18,000. During the process of the second sale, the property was separated into 2 distinct properties. The third property was sold for $209,000, resulting in a loss of  $34,000.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had no loans which were not classified as nonaccrual, 90 days past due or troubled debt restructurings but where known information about possible credit problems of the borrowers caused management to have concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and which may result in the future inclusion of such items in non-performing loans.\nThe following table provides information with respect to partial charge-offs on non-performing loans and accruing troubled debt restructurings at the dates indicated.\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less partially charged off non-performing loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted non-performing loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing loans and accruing troubled debt restructurings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted non-performing loans and accruing troubled debt restructurings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted non-performing loans to total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted non-performing loans and accruing troubled debt restructurings to total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses to adjusted non-performing loans and accruing troubled debt\nrestructurings at end of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>132.2% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.5% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nClassified Assets. Central Federal assigns a risk rating to loans and foreclosed assets to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of the assets. These risk ratings are also subject to examination by Central Federal's regulators. We categorize the assets based on the financial condition of the borrowers, trends in the industries in which the borrower operates and the fair values of collateral securing the loans and foreclosed assets.\nLoans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. If left uncorrected, this potential weakness may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of Central Federal's credit position at some future date. Special mention loans are not adversely classified and do not expose Central Federal to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. Loans classified as substandard are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the repayment of the debt. Well-defined weaknesses include a borrower's lack of marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction on time, or the failure to fulfill economic expectations. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that Central Federal will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Special mention\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Substandard </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>613 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total criticized and classified loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreclosed assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>608 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total criticized and classified assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>760 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Portfolio. Our board of directors has the overall responsibility for the investment portfolio, including approval of the investment policy. Our primary investment objectives are: (i) to provide and maintain liquidity; (ii) to fully employ the available funds of Central Federal; (iii) to earn an average rate of return on invested funds competitive with comparable institutions; (iv) to manage interest rate risk; and (v) to limit credit and interest rate risk. Our chief executive officer is responsible for the implementation of our policy and monitoring our investment performance. Our board of directors reviews the status of our investment portfolio on a monthly basis.\nWe have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored agencies and of state and municipal governments, mortgage-backed securities and certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions. Within certain\nregulatory limits, we also may invest a portion of our assets in other permissible securities. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, we also are required to maintain an investment in the stock of that institution.\nThe following table sets forth the amortized costs and fair values of our available-for-sale securities at the dates indicated.\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amortized Cost\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amortized Cost\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Investments available-for-sale: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage Backed Securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,321 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Small Business Administration Pools\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>954 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Municipal Obligation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>403 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.

The increase is a result of purchasing several short-term certificates of deposit to provide a higher return than the overnight earnings rate; provided rate increases occur as projected, the cash flow will be reinvested at higher rates as they mature.\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Weighted\nAverage Rate\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Certificates of Deposit in Other Financial Institutions Maturing In: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,488 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.16% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.76 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.64% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities available-for-sale\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,581 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to our investment portfolio, at December 31, 2016 we held $97,000 of Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines stock, carried at cost.\nDeposits. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. Deposits generally are attracted from within our market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including non-interest-bearing demand deposits (such as checking accounts), interest-bearing demand deposit accounts (such as NOW and money market accounts), statement savings accounts, and certificates of deposit. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate, among other factors.\nThe following table sets forth the balances of our deposit accounts at the dates indicated.\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest-Bearing DDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.5% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.8% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest-Bearing DDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.6% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,765 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.2% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Savings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of Deposit, $250,000 or more\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of Deposit, less than $250,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,502 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.3% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth deposit activity for the years indicated.\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20,392) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ending Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal deposits decreased by $20.4 million, or 30.6%, from $66.6 million, or 82.4% of total assets, at December 31, 2015 to $46.2 million, or 62.4% of total assets, at December 31, 2016. The higher balance at December 31, 2015 stemmed from the receipt of subscriptions in advance of the conversion of Central Federal to stock form, which were maintained during December 2015 in a deposit account at Central Federal. Interest-bearing demand deposits make up the majority of the deposit balance, accounting for $20.6 million, or 44.6%, and $18.8 million, or 28.2%, as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Non-interest bearing demand deposits decreased by $18.4 million due primarily to deposits held for subscriptions related to the company's stock conversion, being transferred to the holding company or invested. Savings accounts remained consistent.\nCertificates of deposits, specifically those less than $250,000, decreased by $3.3 million as a number of certificates matured in 2016.

Stockholders' equity increased by $14.1 million, or 103.3%, to $27.8 million at December 31, 2016 from $13.7 million at December 31, 2015 as the result of the conversion of Central Federal from a federally chartered mutual savings association into a federally chartered stock savings association and the related sale of common stock, which was completed on January 12, 2016. The proceeds from the sale of common stock in the subscription were the main source of the increase in stockholders' equity. As described above, the Company had a net loss of  $873,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity Management\nLiquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. Our primary sources of funds available to meet short-term liquidity needs consist of deposits, funds from scheduled loan payments, loan prepayments, and income on earning assets. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition.\nOur most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits, and securities available for sale. At December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled $12.2 million. Certificates of deposits in other financial institutions and securities available-for-sale totaled $4.7 million and $6.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016.\nOur cash flows are composed of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $ 40,000 and $715,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of activity in securities available-for-sale and loans, was $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and net cash provided by investing activities was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash used in financing activities, consisting of activity in deposit accounts and proceeds from sale of common stock, was $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities was $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCertificates of deposit maturing over the next 12 months total $12.3 million, or 65.6%, of certificates of deposits. Although we generally manage the pricing of our deposits to be competitive, management understands that if these maturing deposits are not reinvested or do not stay with Central Federal, we will be required to seek other sources of funding or rely on new certificates of deposit. If these deposits are withdrawn, it is anticipated that they would be funded with available cash or replaced with deposits from other customers. Federal Home Loan Bank or Federal Reserve Bank borrowings or proceeds from the sale of securities could also be used to replace unanticipated outflows of deposits.\nCapital Management\nWe are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the OCC, including risk-based capital measures. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At December 31, 2016, we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements, and were considered well capitalized\u201d under regulatory guidelines, with Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets ratio of 27.0%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 52.9%, a total-risk based capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 53.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 52.9%. Refer to Note 15 to the accompanying Notes to the Financial Statements.\nThe capital from the offering of Central Federal Bancshares common stock in connection with the conversion of Central Federal to stock form will significantly increase our liquidity and capital resources in future periods. Over time, the initial level of liquidity will be reduced as net proceeds from the stock offering are used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of lending activities. Our financial condition and results of operations will be enhanced by the capital from the offering, resulting in increased net interest-earning assets and net interest income. However, the large increase in equity resulting from the capital raised in the offering will, initially, have an adverse impact on our return on equity, and under OCC regulations, we were not allowed to repurchase any shares during the first year following the offering, unless extraordinary circumstances existed and we received regulatory approval.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. In the normal course of business, Central Federal has outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which are not included in the accompanying financial statements. Central Federal's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. Central Federal had $2.8 million in unfunded commitments under lines of credit, and no standby letters of credit, as of December 31, 2016. Unfunded commitments under lines of credit were $5.6 million and standby letters of credit were $15,000 as of December 31, 2015.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend a customer as long as there is no violation of any conditions established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Central Federal evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case by case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by Central Federal upon extension of credit, is based on management credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, and income producing commercial property.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by Central Federal to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Central Federal's policy for obtaining collateral, and the nature of such collateral, is essentially the same as that involved in making commitments to extend credit. Central Federal was not required to perform on any financial guarantees and did not incur any losses on its commitments.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nAs a result of our banking activities, we are exposed to interest rate risk. As a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit our exposure to changes in market interest rates. We manage interest rate sensitivity of our interest-bearing liabilities and interest-earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment.\nA major source of interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets as compared to the repricing of liabilities. Deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturity of deposits. As a result, sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect our earnings. We seek to reduce the potential volatility of our earnings by continually improving the matching between our asset and liability maturities and rates.\nCentral Federal's goal is to manage asset and liability positions to moderate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our earnings, while also controlling exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by our board of directors. These limits and guidelines reflect Central Federal's tolerance for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons.\nNet Portfolio Value. We currently utilize economic value of equity analysis to review our level of interest rate risk. We measure our interest rate risk through the use of a financial model provided by an outside consulting firm. This model measures interest rate risk by capturing changes in the economic value of assets and liabilities, based on a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. Economic value represents the market value of our assets and liabilities. These analyses assess the risk of loss in market risk-sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained 100 to 400 basis point increase or 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement.\nThe following table presents the change in the economic value of our equity at December 31, 2016 that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates based on assumptions we consider to be reasonable, with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counteract that change.\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> EVE as a Percentage of\nPresent Value of Assets(3)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in Interest\nRates\n(basis points)(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Estimated\nAmount(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Estimated Increase\n(Decrease) in EVE\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> EVE\nRatio(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n(basis points)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +400\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,504) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.85) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.09% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(61) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +300\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,629 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,505) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(661) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.13) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(101) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.48) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.70 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(598) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.83) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(133) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\nAssumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.\n(2)\nEVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts.\n(3)\nPresent value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets.\n(4)\nEVE Ratio represents EVE divided by the present value of assets.\nWe use various assumptions in assessing interest rate risk. These assumptions relate to interest rates, loan prepayment rates, deposit decay rates and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios, among others. As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analysis presented in the foregoing table. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgage loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, if there is a change in interest rates, expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. Prepayment rates can have a significant impact on interest income. Because of the large percentage of loans we hold, rising or falling interest rates have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of our earning assets that in turn affect the rate sensitivity position. When interest rates rise, prepayments tend to slow. When interest rates fall, prepayments tend to rise. Our asset sensitivity would be reduced if prepayments slow and vice versa. While we believe these assumptions to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future loan repayment activity.\nImpact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,\u201d an amendment to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. This amendment supersedes the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories, requires equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income, and simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The amendment requires public business entities that are required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet to measure that fair value using the exit price notion. The amendment requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total\nchange in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option. The amendment requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. The amendment reduces diversity in current practice by clarifying that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available for sale securities in combination with the entity's other deferred tax assets. This amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities should apply the amendment by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, with the exception of the amendment related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. The Company intends to adopt the accounting standard during the first quarter of 2018, as required, and is currently evaluating the impact of implementation.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The ASU requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. Additionally, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. For the Company, this update will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company has not yet determined the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on the consolidated financial statements.\nEffect of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe financial statements and related financial data presented in this prospectus have been prepared according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial positions and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and service.", "item_7_text": "Item 7.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nThe Company is a holding company that owns 100% of Central Federal. Central Federal is a community-oriented financial institution founded in 1952, dedicated to serving the financial service needs of customers within its market area, which generally consists of Phelps County, Missouri, although it also services customers in the contiguous Missouri countries of Dent, Texas, Crawford, Pulaski and Maries. We currently operate out of our office in Rolla, Missouri.\nWe offer a variety of loan and deposit products to meet the borrowing needs of our customers. Our real estate loans consist primarily of residential loans, including owner-occupied and non-owner occupied one-to four-family residential loans. We also offer commercial and multi-family real estate loans, commercial business loans and consumer loans, including automobile and recreational vehicle loans. We are subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC, our primary federal regulator, and the FDIC, our deposit insurer. The Company is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\nWe will continue to explore ways to service our customers and their needs in order to be a full service banking institution. The results of our operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on interest-earning assets, primarily loans, and interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, consisting of deposits. The interest income we generate is based on the origination of commercial, mortgage and consumer loans. Our primary source of funding is deposits. The largest expenses we incur are associated with salaries and related employee benefits. It is critical for Central Federal to maintain appropriate regulatory leverage and risk-based capital ratios.\nOperating Strategy\nBuilding on our strengths as a community-oriented financial institution. We have operated continuously as a community-oriented financial institution since we were founded in 1952. We are committed to meeting the financial needs of our local community and are dedicated to providing quality personal service to our customers. In that regard, we are focused on building our customer base in the communities we serve through the enhancement of our products and additional marketing of these products and services. Further, we have provided our customers the opportunity to become shareholders through our stock offering.\nIncreasing loan production while maintaining our asset quality. Our loan portfolio has slightly declined over the past few years in our very competitive market area. Through additional marketing and perhaps the addition of more lending personnel, we hope to grow our loan portfolio. In growing the loan portfolio, we will seek to maintain strong asset quality by following prudent underwriting guidelines and utilizing our knowledge of our local market area.\nStrengthening our capital to protect against rising interest rates. We currently have a strong capital base which is sufficient for interest rate risk purposes in the current low interest rate environment given our interest rate risk profile. We know if interest rates rise, having a strong capital base will provide us with additional strength to withstand the impact of rising interest rates. Further, the cash generated from the conversion could be used to fund loans or purchase investment securities at higher interest rate levels should interest rates rise, providing additional net interest income.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term include the determination of the allowance for loan losses, valuation of foreclosed assets, and valuation of deferred tax assets.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is an estimate made by management as necessary to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense. Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after loan losses and loan growth. Loan losses are charged-off against the allowance when Central Federal determines the loan balance to be uncollectible. Cash received on previously charged-off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance. Although management believes the allowance to be adequate, ultimate losses may vary from its estimates. At least quarterly, the board of directors reviews the adequacy of the allowance, including consideration of the relevant risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions, and other factors. If the board of directors and management determine that changes are warranted based on those reviews, the allowance is adjusted. In addition, Central Federal's primary regulator may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available at the time of their examinations. The regulatory agency is not, however, directly involved in the determination of the allowance for loan losses, and any decisions to increase or decrease the allowance for loan losses are the responsibility of Central Federal's management.\nForeclosed Assets. Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets held for sale are carried at the lower of the new cost basis or fair value less costs to sell. This evaluation is inherently subjective and requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available. Due to potential changes in conditions, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in fair values will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nDeferred Tax Assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. These calculations are based on many complex factors including estimates of the timing of reversals of temporary differences, the interpretation of federal and state income tax laws, and a determination of the differences between the tax and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates and interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax liabilities.\nThe Company maintains significant net deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences, the largest of which relates to the Company's contribution to establish the Central Federal Community Foundation. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not\u201d that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon management's judgment and evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, including the forecasts of future income,\ntax planning strategies and assessments of the current and future economic and business conditions. The Company considers both positive and negative evidence regarding the ultimate realizability of the deferred tax assets. Positive evidence includes the ability to implement tax planning strategies to accelerate taxable income recognition and the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods. Negative evidence includes the continued expenses related to operating as a publicly traded company, current financial performance, and the general business and economic trends.\nIn connection with the offering of common stock, the Company contributed to the Central Federal Community Foundation $100,000 in cash and common stock with a fair value of approximately $688,000 (68,770 shares at the $10.00 offering price) for a total contribution of approximately $788,000. For Federal income tax purposes, the deduction for charitable contributions is limited to a maximum of 10% of taxable income before charitable contributions, net operating losses and dividends received deductions. We are permitted, under the Internal Revenue Code, to carry the excess contribution over the five-year period following the contribution to the charitable foundation, subject to the 10% annual limitation.\nWe may not have sufficient taxable income to be able to fully deduct the contribution in the year in which it is made or during the five-year carryover period permitted under the Internal Revenue Code. We estimate we will not be able to fully utilize the carryover, and we established a valuation allowance related to the entire deferred tax asset related to the contribution as it is not deemed to be realizable. This determination was based primarily upon the effect of anticipated costs related to operation as a publicly traded company and their effect on future taxable income. The creation of the valuation allowance does not have an effect on the Company's cash flows and may be recoverable in subsequent periods if the Company were to realize certain sustainable future taxable income. It is possible that future conditions may differ substantially from those anticipated in determining the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and adjustments may be required in the future.\nDetermining the ultimate settlement of any tax position requires significant estimates and judgements in arriving at the amount of tax benefits to be recognized in the financial statements. It is possible that the tax benefits realized upon the ultimate resolution of a tax position may result in tax benefits that are significantly different from those estimated.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nOverview. We had a net loss of  $873,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to net income, for Central Federal only, of  $69,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $942,000, or 1,365.2%, decrease in net income between the years was primarily a result of the foundation charitable contribution. Net interest income increased $219,000 and noninterest expense increased $1.3 million, due to the $788,000 contribution and an increase of  $376,000 for legal and professional fees related to outside consulting fees paid due to lack of a chief financial officer for the first half of 2016 and costs as a new public company.\nNet Interest Income. The following table presents a summary of net interest income before provision for loan losses.\n\nNet interest income increased by $219,000, or 11.5%, to $2,128,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $1,909,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Although interest income on loans decreased by $48,000 from the year ended December 31, 2015, to the year ended December 31, 2016, the interest\nincome generated by the investment portfolio increased $165,000 over the prior year, and interest expense decreased by $102,000 during that same period. Securities and other interest income consists of interest on bank accounts, securities available for sale, certificates of deposits, federal funds sold and dividends on FHLB Stock.\nThe decrease in interest income on loans is primarily the result of a 10 basis point decrease in the yield on the loan portfolio.\nThe decrease in interest expense on deposits was due primarily to a decrease in the average rate on deposits of 27 basis points. The average balance of certificates of deposit decreased by $3.9 million and the average balance of interest-bearing DDA accounts increased by $7.8 million. This change in deposit mix contributed to a further decline in deposit costs.\nAverage Balances and Yields. The following table presents information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends from average interest-earning assets, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, and the resulting annualized average yields and costs. The yields and costs for the years indicated are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the years presented. Average balances have been calculated using daily balances, and non-accrual loans are included in average balances only. Loan fees are included in interest income on loans and are insignificant. Any adjustments necessary to present yields on a tax-equivalent basis are insignificant.\n\n(1)\nIncludes municipal obligations with an average balance and interest income of  $416,000 and $12,000, respectively.\n(2)\nInterest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities.\n(3)\nNet interest-earning assets represents total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities.\n(4)\nNet interest margin represents net interest income divided by total interest-earning assets.\nRate/Volume Analysis. The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. Changes attributable to changes in both rate and volume have been allocated proportionally based on the absolute dollar amounts of changes in each. The following table presents the rate volume analysis for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\n\nProvision for Loan Losses. We maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level necessary to absorb management's best estimate of probable loan losses in the portfolio. Management reviews the level of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis based on a variety of factors. Management considers, among other factors, historical loss experience, type and amount of loans, borrower concentrations and current conditions of the economy. In addition, the allowance considers the level of loans which management monitors as a result of inconsistent repayment patterns. Such loans carry a higher degree of credit risk than our historical single-family lending.\nManagement also reviews individual loans for which full collectability may not be reasonably assured and considers, among other matters, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. This evaluation is ongoing and results in variations in our provision for loan losses.\nWe had no provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2016, nor was there a provision for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net loan recoveries amounted to $2,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to net charge offs of  $18,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAlthough management utilizes its best judgment in providing for losses, there can be no assurance that they will not have to change its allowance for loan losses in subsequent periods. The allowance for loan losses reflects the estimate we believe to be appropriate to cover incurred probable losses in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2016. While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, such estimates and assumptions could be proven incorrect in the future, and the actual amount of future provisions may exceed the amount of past provisions, and the increase in future provisions that may be required may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our primary regulator may comment during an examination on the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs. The regulatory agency is not, however, directly involved in the determination of the allowance for loan losses, and any decisions to increase or decrease the allowance for loan losses are the responsibility of Central Federal's management. Management will continue to monitor the allowance for loan losses and make additional provisions to the allowance as appropriate.\nAn analysis of the changes in the allowance for loan losses, non-performing loans and classified loans is presented under Allowance for Loan Losses, Analysis of Non-Performing Assets and Troubled Debt Restructurings, and Classified Assets below.\nNoninterest Income. Total noninterest income decreased by $12,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This was a result of customer service fees decreasing $5,000 and other non-interest income decreasing by $7,000.\n\nNoninterest Expenses. Total noninterest expenses increased by $1.3 million, or 65.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $788,000 contribution made to the Central Federal Community Foundation during the year ended December 31, 2016. Legal and professional services expense increased by $376,000 from year to year due to higher professional fees incurred as a public company and certain one-time events, including legal costs incurred for establishment of the ESOP and outside consulting fees paid due to lack of a CFO for half of the year. At this time, we do not expect this trend in legal and professional fees to continue. In addition, data processing and outside services increased by $17,000 from year to year attributable to IT and network expenses, the expense to introduce chip card technology and increases in data processing costs.\n\nNM - Not meaningful\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). We had an income tax benefit of  $59,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to an income tax expense of  $44,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. This is due to a loss before income taxes of  $932,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to income before income taxes of  $113,000 during the same period in 2015. In 2016, we established a valuation allowance of  $236,000 on the entire deferred tax asset related to the contribution to the Central Federal Community Foundation of  $788,000 as it is not deemed to be realizable.\nBalance Sheet Analysis as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nTotal Assets. At December 31, 2016, total assets were $74.0 million, a decrease of  $6.9 million, or 8.5%, from total assets of  $80.9 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in total assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due mainly to the net effect of a $12.8 million, or a 51.2%, decrease in cash and cash equivalents while investments increased $6.1 million with the receipt of funds generated in the conversion of Central Federal to stock form. The decrease in other assets relates to the deferral of stock conversion costs of  $1.4 million at December 31, 2015.\nLoans. The largest portion of our loan portfolio consists of residential real estate loans which totaled $33.0 million, or 66.6%, and $31.7 million, or 63.2%, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Residential real estate loans increased by $1.3 million, or 4.1%, during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCommercial and multi-family real estate loans totaled $14.4 million and represented 29.2% of total loans at December 31, 2016. This is a decrease of  $1.7 million, or 10.5%, from $16.1 million, or 32.1% of total loans, at December 31, 2015. The market area served by Central Federal is very competitive and\ninterest rate sensitive. Commercial real estate loans generally consist of loans secured by multi-family residential rentals, retail stores, and other commercial real estate.\nCommercial business loans totaled $1.5 million and $2.0 million, comprising 3.1% and 3.9% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Commercial business loans decreased $408,000, or 20.9%, during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nConsumer and other loans increased by $140,000, or 33.5%, from $418,000 at December 31, 2015 to $558,000 at December 31, 2016.\nLoan Portfolio Composition. The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio at the dates indicated.\n\nLoan Maturity. The following table summarizes the scheduled repayments of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2016. Demand loans, loans having no stated repayment schedule or maturity and overdraft loans are reported as being due in one year or less. Actual maturities may differ due to prepayments.\n\nFixed vs Adjustable Rate Loans. The following table sets forth the dollar amount of all loans at December 31, 2016 that are due after December 31 2017, and that have either fixed interest rates, or floating or adjustable interest rates. The amounts shown below exclude deferred loan origination fees and deferred loan costs.\n\nScheduled contractual principal repayments of loans do not reflect the actual life of such assets. The average life of loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments. In addition, due-on-sale clauses on loans generally give us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and, conversely, decrease when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially lower than rates on existing mortgage loans.\nLoan Activity. The following table shows loan activity, consisting of loans originated, loan payoffs and loan charge-offs, for the year indicated.\n\nLoan originations come from a variety of sources. Our primary sources of loan originations are existing customers, walk-in traffic, advertising and referrals from customers.\nWe did not sell any loans during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. From time to time we do buy participation loans. We did not purchase any loans during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses (allowance) is an estimate of probable loan losses in Central Federal's loan portfolio. The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense. Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after loan losses and loan growth. Loan losses are charged-off against the allowance when Central Federal determines the loan balance to be uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.\nGeneral Allowances. The general component of the loan loss allowance covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical losses adjusted for current qualitative factors. The historical loss component is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced by Central Federal over the most recent three years. This is adjusted for qualitative factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These qualitative factors include: (i) changes in the value of underlying collateral; (ii) changes in lending policies and underwriting practices; (iii) national and local economic trends and conditions; (iv) volume and terms of loans; (v) experience, ability and depth of lending management; (vi) changes in past due loans, nonaccrual loans, and credit quality; (vii) changes in loan file review; (viii) changes in credit concentrations and (ix) the impact of competition.\nSpecific Allowances. The specific component includes allowances for loans that are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that Central Federal will be unable to collect the scheduled payments and principal or interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Central Federal measures individual impairment based on the present value of expected future\ncash flows discounted at the original contractual interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, it may measure impairment based on an observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral, if collateral dependent. A loan is collateral dependent if the repayment is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral.\nUnallocated Allowances. Allowances other than general and specific allocations are included in the unallocated portion of the loan loss allowance. The unallocated allowance reflects the imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating the general allowance.\nAt December 31, 2016, the allowance was $263,000 and represented 0.5% of total loans. At December 31, 2015, the allowance was $261,000 and also represented 0.5% of total loans. At December 31, 2016, the largest allowance in the portfolio was the allowance for residential real estate loans, which made up about 68.9% of the total allowance at $181,000, and at December 31, 2015, the largest allowance in the portfolio was the allowance for residential real estate loans, which made up about 70.1% of the total allowance at $183,000.\nThe following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated. The allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in each category.\n\nAt December 31, 2016, our allowance for loan losses of  $263,000 was 132.2% of non-performing loans. At December 31, 2015, our allowance for loan losses of  $261,000 was 33.5% of non-performing loans.\nAlthough we believe that we use the best available information to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and our results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. At least quarterly, the board of directors reviews the adequacy of the allowance, including consideration of the relevant risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions and other factors. If the board of directors and management determine that changes are warranted based on those reviews, the allowance is adjusted.\nFurthermore, while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and have taken into account the views of regulators and the current economic environment, there can be no assurance that in the future Central Federal's regulators will not require further increases in the allowance. The regulatory agency is not, however, directly involved in the determination of the allowance for loan losses, and any decisions to increase or decrease the allowance for loan losses are the responsibility of Central Federal's management. Any material increases in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nAnalysis of Loan Loss Experience. The following table sets forth an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the years indicated.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the allowance increased by $2,000 to $263,000, as compared to a decrease of  $18,000 to $261,000 during the same period in 2015. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to $1,000 in charge-offs offset with $3,000 in recoveries. Charge-offs were minimal in 2016 with the largest charge-off being $1,000 in consumer loans. In 2015, the largest charge-off was for $17,000. The allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans ratio increased due to a decrease in non-performing loans to $199,000 as of December 31, 2016 from $779,000 as of December 31, 2015. Non-performing loans decreased due primarily to a commercial real estate loan which was paid off during 2016. The allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans as of December 31, 2016 increased by 0.01% to 0.53% compared to 0.52% as of December 31, 2015.\nDelinquencies. The following table provides the information about delinquencies in our loan portfolio at the dates indicated.\n\nManaging risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution. Our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk, interest rate risk and market risk. Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or the principal balance of a loan when it is due. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of\ninterest income and/or the potential increase of interest expense as a result of changes in interest rates. Market risk reflects changes in the value of collateral underlying loans receivable and the valuation of real estate held by Central Federal. Other risks that we face are operational risk, liquidity risks and reputation risk. Operational risks include risks related to fraud, regulatory compliance, processing errors, technology, use of third-party vendors and disaster recovery. Liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors, lenders or potential borrowers. Reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press, whether true or not, could cause a decline in our customer base or income.\nAnalysis of Non-Performing Assets and Troubled Debt Restructurings. We consider foreclosed assets, which are assets repossessed by Central Federal, accruing loans 90 days or more past due and non-accrual loans to be non-performing assets. Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are considered foreclosed assets and are held for sale. These assets are initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure, which establishes a new cost basis for those assets. Any write-downs based on the asset's fair value at the date of foreclosure, or subsequent to the date of foreclosure, are charged to the allowance for loan losses. The assets held for sale are carried at the lower of the new cost basis or fair value less costs to sell.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when the collectability is considered to be uncertain or payments have become more than 90 days or more delinquent, unless the credit is well-secured and in process of collection. In some cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. Credit card loans and other personal loans are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. As of December 31, 2016, there were three loans on non-accrual status totaling $199,000, which is a decrease of  $480,000, from the two loans on non-accrual status amounting to $679,000 as of December 31, 2015. Nonaccrual loans for those periods represented.4% and 1.4% of total loans, respectively.\nUnder certain circumstances, Central Federal will provide borrowers relief through loan restructuring. A restructuring of debt constitutes a TDR if Central Federal, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial situation, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise have considered. Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment. Depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower, restructuring loans can involve loans remaining in full nonaccrual, moving to nonaccrual or continuing on accrual status.\nThe following table provides information with respect to our non-performing assets and accruing troubled debt restructurings at the dates indicated.\n\nTotal non-performing loans decreased by $580,000 from $779,000 at December 31, 2015 to $199,000 at December 31, 2016. The majority of this change was due to a $390,000 commercial real estate loan which was paid off during 2016.\nForeclosed assets at December 31, 2016 consisted of one property totaling $26,000, which is a decrease from the three foreclosed properties at December 31, 2015 which totaled $608,000. The decline in the total amount of foreclosed assets is due primarily to three properties being sold. The first sale was for a property sold in Cuba, Missouri for $267,000, resulting in a gain of  $2,000. The second sale was a property sold in Rolla, Missouri for $91,000, at a gain of  $18,000. During the process of the second sale, the property was separated into 2 distinct properties. The third property was sold for $209,000, resulting in a loss of  $34,000.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had no loans which were not classified as nonaccrual, 90 days past due or troubled debt restructurings but where known information about possible credit problems of the borrowers caused management to have concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and which may result in the future inclusion of such items in non-performing loans.\nThe following table provides information with respect to partial charge-offs on non-performing loans and accruing troubled debt restructurings at the dates indicated.\n\nClassified Assets. Central Federal assigns a risk rating to loans and foreclosed assets to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of the assets. These risk ratings are also subject to examination by Central Federal's regulators. We categorize the assets based on the financial condition of the borrowers, trends in the industries in which the borrower operates and the fair values of collateral securing the loans and foreclosed assets.\nLoans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. If left uncorrected, this potential weakness may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of Central Federal's credit position at some future date. Special mention loans are not adversely classified and do not expose Central Federal to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. Loans classified as substandard are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the repayment of the debt. Well-defined weaknesses include a borrower's lack of marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction on time, or the failure to fulfill economic expectations. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that Central Federal will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\n\nInvestment Portfolio. Our board of directors has the overall responsibility for the investment portfolio, including approval of the investment policy. Our primary investment objectives are: (i) to provide and maintain liquidity; (ii) to fully employ the available funds of Central Federal; (iii) to earn an average rate of return on invested funds competitive with comparable institutions; (iv) to manage interest rate risk; and (v) to limit credit and interest rate risk. Our chief executive officer is responsible for the implementation of our policy and monitoring our investment performance. Our board of directors reviews the status of our investment portfolio on a monthly basis.\nWe have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored agencies and of state and municipal governments, mortgage-backed securities and certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions. Within certain\nregulatory limits, we also may invest a portion of our assets in other permissible securities. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, we also are required to maintain an investment in the stock of that institution.\nThe following table sets forth the amortized costs and fair values of our available-for-sale securities at the dates indicated.\n\nAt December 31, 2016, our securities available-for-sale consisted of six mortgage-backed securities and a fully guaranteed Small Business Administration investment, with fair values of  $5,182,000 and $954,000, respectively, purchased during the year ended December 31, 2016, one municipal bond backed by a local school district with a fair value of  $403,000, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation common stock with a fair value of  $42,000 for a total of  $6,581,000 as compared to the December 31, 2015 available-for-sale security portfolio with a fair value of  $436,000.\nThe increase in securities of  $6.1 million resulted from cash available to invest as a result of the conversion of Central Federal to stock form.\nWe held $4.7 million of certificates of deposits in other financial institutions at December 31, 2016, compared to $2.5 million at December 31, 2015. The increase is a result of purchasing several short-term certificates of deposit to provide a higher return than the overnight earnings rate; provided rate increases occur as projected, the cash flow will be reinvested at higher rates as they mature.\n\nIn addition to our investment portfolio, at December 31, 2016 we held $97,000 of Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines stock, carried at cost.\nDeposits. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. Deposits generally are attracted from within our market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including non-interest-bearing demand deposits (such as checking accounts), interest-bearing demand deposit accounts (such as NOW and money market accounts), statement savings accounts, and certificates of deposit. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate, among other factors.\nThe following table sets forth the balances of our deposit accounts at the dates indicated.\n\nThe following table sets forth deposit activity for the years indicated.\n\nTotal deposits decreased by $20.4 million, or 30.6%, from $66.6 million, or 82.4% of total assets, at December 31, 2015 to $46.2 million, or 62.4% of total assets, at December 31, 2016. The higher balance at December 31, 2015 stemmed from the receipt of subscriptions in advance of the conversion of Central Federal to stock form, which were maintained during December 2015 in a deposit account at Central Federal. Interest-bearing demand deposits make up the majority of the deposit balance, accounting for $20.6 million, or 44.6%, and $18.8 million, or 28.2%, as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Non-interest bearing demand deposits decreased by $18.4 million due primarily to deposits held for subscriptions related to the company's stock conversion, being transferred to the holding company or invested. Savings accounts remained consistent.\nCertificates of deposits, specifically those less than $250,000, decreased by $3.3 million as a number of certificates matured in 2016. The follow table provides information regarding all of our certificates of deposit by time remaining until maturity as of December 31, 2016.\n\nThe following table indicates the amount of certificates of deposits with balances of  $100,000 or greater by time remaining until maturity as of December 31, 2016.\n\nStockholders' Equity. Stockholders' equity increased by $14.1 million, or 103.3%, to $27.8 million at December 31, 2016 from $13.7 million at December 31, 2015 as the result of the conversion of Central Federal from a federally chartered mutual savings association into a federally chartered stock savings association and the related sale of common stock, which was completed on January 12, 2016. The proceeds from the sale of common stock in the subscription were the main source of the increase in stockholders' equity. As described above, the Company had a net loss of  $873,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity Management\nLiquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. Our primary sources of funds available to meet short-term liquidity needs consist of deposits, funds from scheduled loan payments, loan prepayments, and income on earning assets. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition.\nOur most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits, and securities available for sale. At December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled $12.2 million. Certificates of deposits in other financial institutions and securities available-for-sale totaled $4.7 million and $6.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016.\nOur cash flows are composed of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $ 40,000 and $715,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of activity in securities available-for-sale and loans, was $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and net cash provided by investing activities was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash used in financing activities, consisting of activity in deposit accounts and proceeds from sale of common stock, was $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities was $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCertificates of deposit maturing over the next 12 months total $12.3 million, or 65.6%, of certificates of deposits. Although we generally manage the pricing of our deposits to be competitive, management understands that if these maturing deposits are not reinvested or do not stay with Central Federal, we will be required to seek other sources of funding or rely on new certificates of deposit. If these deposits are withdrawn, it is anticipated that they would be funded with available cash or replaced with deposits from other customers. Federal Home Loan Bank or Federal Reserve Bank borrowings or proceeds from the sale of securities could also be used to replace unanticipated outflows of deposits.\nCapital Management\nWe are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the OCC, including risk-based capital measures. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At December 31, 2016, we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements, and were considered well capitalized\u201d under regulatory guidelines, with Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets ratio of 27.0%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 52.9%, a total-risk based capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 53.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 52.9%. Refer to Note 15 to the accompanying Notes to the Financial Statements.\nThe capital from the offering of Central Federal Bancshares common stock in connection with the conversion of Central Federal to stock form will significantly increase our liquidity and capital resources in future periods. Over time, the initial level of liquidity will be reduced as net proceeds from the stock offering are used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of lending activities. Our financial condition and results of operations will be enhanced by the capital from the offering, resulting in increased net interest-earning assets and net interest income. However, the large increase in equity resulting from the capital raised in the offering will, initially, have an adverse impact on our return on equity, and under OCC regulations, we were not allowed to repurchase any shares during the first year following the offering, unless extraordinary circumstances existed and we received regulatory approval.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. In the normal course of business, Central Federal has outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which are not included in the accompanying financial statements. Central Federal's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. Central Federal had $2.8 million in unfunded commitments under lines of credit, and no standby letters of credit, as of December 31, 2016. Unfunded commitments under lines of credit were $5.6 million and standby letters of credit were $15,000 as of December 31, 2015.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend a customer as long as there is no violation of any conditions established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Central Federal evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case by case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by Central Federal upon extension of credit, is based on management credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, and income producing commercial property.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by Central Federal to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Central Federal's policy for obtaining collateral, and the nature of such collateral, is essentially the same as that involved in making commitments to extend credit. Central Federal was not required to perform on any financial guarantees and did not incur any losses on its commitments.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nAs a result of our banking activities, we are exposed to interest rate risk. As a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit our exposure to changes in market interest rates. We manage interest rate sensitivity of our interest-bearing liabilities and interest-earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment.\nA major source of interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets as compared to the repricing of liabilities. Deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturity of deposits. As a result, sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect our earnings. We seek to reduce the potential volatility of our earnings by continually improving the matching between our asset and liability maturities and rates.\nCentral Federal's goal is to manage asset and liability positions to moderate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our earnings, while also controlling exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by our board of directors. These limits and guidelines reflect Central Federal's tolerance for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons.\nNet Portfolio Value. We currently utilize economic value of equity analysis to review our level of interest rate risk. We measure our interest rate risk through the use of a financial model provided by an outside consulting firm. This model measures interest rate risk by capturing changes in the economic value of assets and liabilities, based on a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. Economic value represents the market value of our assets and liabilities. These analyses assess the risk of loss in market risk-sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained 100 to 400 basis point increase or 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement.\nThe following table presents the change in the economic value of our equity at December 31, 2016 that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates based on assumptions we consider to be reasonable, with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counteract that change.\n\n(1)\nAssumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.\n(2)\nEVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts.\n(3)\nPresent value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets.\n(4)\nEVE Ratio represents EVE divided by the present value of assets.\nWe use various assumptions in assessing interest rate risk. These assumptions relate to interest rates, loan prepayment rates, deposit decay rates and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios, among others. As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analysis presented in the foregoing table. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgage loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, if there is a change in interest rates, expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. Prepayment rates can have a significant impact on interest income. Because of the large percentage of loans we hold, rising or falling interest rates have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of our earning assets that in turn affect the rate sensitivity position. When interest rates rise, prepayments tend to slow. When interest rates fall, prepayments tend to rise. Our asset sensitivity would be reduced if prepayments slow and vice versa. While we believe these assumptions to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future loan repayment activity.\nImpact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,\u201d an amendment to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. This amendment supersedes the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories, requires equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income, and simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The amendment requires public business entities that are required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet to measure that fair value using the exit price notion. The amendment requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total\nchange in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option. The amendment requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. The amendment reduces diversity in current practice by clarifying that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available for sale securities in combination with the entity's other deferred tax assets. This amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities should apply the amendment by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, with the exception of the amendment related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. The Company intends to adopt the accounting standard during the first quarter of 2018, as required, and is currently evaluating the impact of implementation.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The ASU requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. Additionally, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. For the Company, this update will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company has not yet determined the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on the consolidated financial statements.\nEffect of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe financial statements and related financial data presented in this prospectus have been prepared according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial positions and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and service.", "item_7_tables": "Table 12: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars
