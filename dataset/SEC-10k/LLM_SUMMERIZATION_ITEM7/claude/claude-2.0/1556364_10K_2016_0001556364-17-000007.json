All forward-looking statements and reasons why results may differ included in this Form 10-K are made as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statement or reason why actual results may differ.\nOverview and Background\nWe are a specialty finance company that focuses on the origination, investment and management of commercial real estate loans primarily in the Western U.S. We provide customized, short-term capital to small and middle-market investors and developers who require speed and flexibility. We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are externally managed and advised by OFG, a specialized commercial real estate management company that has originated, serviced and managed alternative commercial real estate investments since 1951.\nThe Company is a Maryland corporation formed to reorganize the business of its predecessor, OMIF, into a publicly traded REIT. Beginning in 2009, OMIF experienced liquidity issues as its borrowers were unable to access credit sources to pay off its loans. OMIF eventually foreclosed on a substantial portion of its loan portfolio, repositioning many of the properties for investment or eventual sale. OMIF also experienced a significant increase in capital withdrawal requests that it was unable to honor due to insufficient cash, net of reserves, and restrictions under the terms of its bank line of credit. In addition, OMIF was restricted by provisions within the partnership agreement from making additional investments in loans while qualified redemption requests remained pending and unpaid. In addition to increasing investor liquidity through public listing of its stock, the Company was created to provide the opportunity for resuming mortgage lending activities, with the goal of increasing income to stockholders.\nOn May 20, 2013, OMIF merged with and into the Company with the Company as the surviving corporation, succeeding to and continuing the business and operations of OMIF. The Company now, by virtue of the Merger, directly or indirectly owns all of the assets and business formerly owned by OMIF. The Company is a deemed successor issuer to OMIF pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act, and on July 1, 2013, the Company's Common Stock was listed on the NYSE MKT exchange. For accounting purposes, the Merger has been treated as a transfer of assets and exchange of shares between entities under common control. The accounting basis used to initially record the assets and liabilities in the Company is the carryover basis of OMIF. OMIF was a California Limited Partnership registered with the SEC that was formed in 1983 for the purposes of funding and servicing short-term commercial real estate loans.\nOur primary sources of revenue are interest income earned on our loan investment portfolio and revenues we generate from our operating real estate assets. We have resumed originating loans and believe the Company is well positioned to capitalize on lending opportunities as the economy continues to recover. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to identify and make loans to suitable commercial real estate borrowers or have adequate capital and liquidity to fund such loans.\nOur operating results are affected primarily by:\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the level of foreclosures and related loan and real estate losses experienced;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the income or losses from foreclosed properties prior to the time of disposal, and our ability to dispose of those properties in a timely manner;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the amount of cash available to invest in loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the amount of borrowing to finance loan investments and our cost of funds on such borrowing;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the level of real estate lending activity in the markets serviced;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the ability to identify and lend to suitable borrowers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the interest rates we are able to charge on loans; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the level of delinquencies on loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBetween 2008 and 2013, we experienced increased delinquent loans and foreclosures which created substantial losses. As a result, we also owned significantly more real estate than in the past, which has reduced cash flow and net income. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 4% of our loans were impaired and/or past maturity, down from 8% as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we owned approximately $113 million of real estate held for sale or investment, which is approximately 44% of total assets, a decrease of $40.7 million or 15% of total assets as compared to December 31, 2015. During 2016, we sold seven real estate properties (three partial) for aggregate net sales proceeds of $90,997,000 (including note receivable of $1,595,000) and net gains totaling $24,498,000 ($20,782,000 to the Company after $3,716,000 gain attributable to non-controlling interest). We will continue to attempt to sell certain of our properties but may need to sell them for losses or wait until market values fully recover. In addition, under the REIT tax rules, we may be subject to a \"prohibited transaction\" penalty tax on tax gains from the sale of our properties in certain circumstances. In addition, we are also limited in the number and dollar amount of properties we can sell in a given year under the REIT tax rules.\nAlthough currently management believes that only one of our delinquent loans will result in loss to the Company (and has caused the Company to record a specific allowance for loan losses on such loan), real estate values could decrease further. Management continues to perform frequent evaluations of collateral values for our loans using internal and external sources, including the use of updated independent appraisals. As a result of these evaluations, the allowance for loan losses and our investments in real estate could increase or decrease in the near term, and such changes could be material.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur primary business objective is to provide our stockholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns by producing consistent and predictable dividends while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We believe we have positioned the Company for future growth and seek to increase funds from operations, or FFO, and distributions to stockholders through active portfolio management and execution of our business plan which is outlined below:\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Capitalize on market lending opportunity by leveraging existing origination network to expand our commercial real estate loan portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Enhance and reposition our commercial real estate assets through the investment of capital and strategic management.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Increase liquidity available for lending activities by focusing on opportunities to remove real estate assets from our balance sheet.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Manage leverage to marginally expand sources of liquidity while maintaining a conservative balance sheet.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCurrent Market Conditions, Risks and Recent Trends\nOur ability to execute our business strategy, particularly the growth of our loan portfolio, is dependent on many factors, including our ability to sell our real estate assets in a timely manner and access financing on favorable terms. The previous economic downturn had a significant negative impact on both us and our borrowers. If similar economic conditions recur in the future, it may limit our options to sell our real estate assets, obtaining financing on favorable terms or otherwise obtain necessary capital to make new loans, and may also adversely impact the creditworthiness of our borrowers which could result in their inability to repay their loans.\nThe commercial real estate markets continue to improve, but uncertainty remains as a result of global market instability, the current political climate and other matters and their potential impact on the U.S. economy and commercial real estate markets. In addition, the growth in multifamily rental rates seen over the past few years are showing signs of stabilizing. If real estate values decline again and/or rent growth subsides, it may limit our new loan originations since borrowers often use increases in the value of, and revenues produced from, their existing properties to support the purchase or investment in additional properties. Declining real estate values may also significantly increase the likelihood that we will have difficulty selling our existing real estate assets in a timely manner, and that we will incur losses on our loans in the event of default because the value of our collateral may be insufficient to cover our investment in the loan. Any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could adversely affect both our interest income from loans as well as our ability to originate loans, which would significantly impact our revenues, results of operations, financial condition, business prospects and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nThe economic environment over the past few years has seen continued improvement in commercial real estate values which has generally increased payoffs and reduced the credit exposure in our loan portfolio. We have made, and continue to make, modifications and extensions to loans when it is economically feasible to do so. In some cases, a modification is a more viable alternative to foreclosure proceedings when a borrower cannot comply with loan terms. In doing so, lower borrower interest rates, combined with non-performing loans, would lower our net interest margins when comparing interest income to our costs of financing. If the markets were to deteriorate and another prolonged economic downturn was to occur, we believe there could be additional loan modifications and delinquencies, which may result in reduced net interest margins and additional losses throughout our sector.\nWe believe that improvement in commercial real estate values has also resulted in increased values of some of our real estate assets. Accordingly, as our real estate assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell, it is possible that we have substantial imbedded gains in certain of our real estate properties held for sale and investment that are not reflected in our financial statements or in the value of our stock.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of how we report our financial condition and results of operations because their application places the most significant demands on the judgment of our management.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses for the reporting periods. Such estimates relate principally to the determination of (1) the allowance for loan losses, (2) the valuation of real estate held for sale and investment (at acquisition and subsequently) and 3) the recoverability of deferred income tax assets.\nAllowance for Loan Losses, Impaired Loans and Non-accrual Status\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses on our investments in mortgage loans. A loan is impaired when it is probable that we may not collect all principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. As part of the detailed loan review, we consider many factors about the specific loan, including payment history, asset performance, borrower's financial capability and other characteristics. Management evaluates loans for non-accrual status each reporting period. A loan is placed on non-accrual status when the loan payment deficiencies exceed 90 days, or earlier if collection of principal and interest is substantially in doubt. When a loan is classified as nonaccrual, interest accruals discontinue and all past due interest remains accrued until the loan becomes current, is paid off or is foreclosed upon. Interest accruals are resumed on such loans only when they are brought fully current with respect to interest and principal and when, in the judgment of management, the loans are estimated to be fully collectible as to both principal and interest. Cash receipts on nonaccrual loans are used to reduce any outstanding accrued interest, and then are recorded as interest income, except when such payments are specifically designated as principal reduction or when management does not believe our investment in the loan is fully recoverable. When a loan is considered impaired, management estimates impairment based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell, generally through the use of appraisals. The determination of the general reserve for loans that are not considered impaired and are collectively evaluated for impairment is based on estimates made by management including consideration of historical losses by portfolio segment, internal asset classifications, and qualitative factors to include economic trends in our service areas, industry experience and trends, geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, our underwriting policies, the character of the loan portfolio, and probable incurred losses inherent in the portfolio taken as a whole. The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense. Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth but actual results may vary and there is no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be sufficient. Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance.\nReal Estate Held for Sale\nReal estate held for sale includes real estate acquired in full or partial settlement of loan obligations, generally through foreclosure, that is being marketed for sale. Real estate held for sale is recorded at acquisition at the property's estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell.\nClassification as Held for Sale-Real estate asset is classified as held for sale in the period when (i) management approves a plan to sell the asset, (ii) the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to usual and customary terms, (iii) a program is initiated to locate a buyer and actively market the asset for sale at a reasonable price, and (iv) completion of the sale is probable within one year. Real estate held for sale is stated at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less disposal cost, with any write-down to fair value less estimated costs to sell recorded as an impairment loss. For any subsequent increase in fair value less disposal cost, the impairment loss may be reversed, but only up to the amount of cumulative loss previously recognized. Depreciation is not recorded on assets classified as held for sale.\nIf circumstances arise that were previously considered unlikely and, as a result, we decide not to sell the real estate asset previously classified as held for sale, the real estate asset is reclassified as held for investment. Upon reclassification, the real estate asset is measured at the lower of (i) its carrying amount prior to classification as held for sale, adjusted for depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the real estate been continuously classified as held for investment, or (ii) its estimated fair value at the time we decide not to sell.\nReal Estate Sales-We evaluate if real estate sale transactions qualify for recognition under the full accrual method, considering whether, among other criteria, the buyer's initial and continuing investments are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay, any receivable due to the Company is not subject to future subordination, the Company has transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership and the Company does not have a substantial continuing involvement with the sold real estate. At the time the sale is consummated, a gain or loss is recognized as the difference between the sale price less disposal cost and the carrying value of the real estate.\nReal Estate Held for Investment\nReal estate held for investment includes real estate purchased or acquired in full or partial settlement of loan obligations, generally through foreclosure, that is not being marketed for sale and is either being operated, such as rental properties; is being managed through the development process, including obtaining appropriate and necessary entitlements and permits and construction; or are idle properties awaiting more favorable market conditions or properties we cannot sell without placing our REIT status at risk or become subject to prohibited transactions penalty tax. Real estate held for investment is recorded at acquisition at the property's estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. Depreciation of buildings and improvements is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated remaining useful lives of buildings and improvements. Depreciation of tenant improvements is provided on the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease terms. Costs related to the improvement of real estate held for sale and investment are capitalized, whereas those related to holding the property are expensed. We evaluate real estate held for investment periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We evaluate cash flows and determine impairments on an individual property basis. In making this determination, we often obtain new appraisals and/or review, among other things, current and future cash flows associated with each property, market information, market prices of similar properties recently sold or currently being offered for sale, and other quantitative and qualitative factors. If an impairment indicator exists, we evaluate whether the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the property, and if we determine that the carrying value is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell and the carrying amount of the property.\nIncome Taxes\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT. As a result of our REIT qualification and distribution policy, we do not generally expect to pay U.S. federal corporate level income taxes. Many of the REIT requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to net capital gains, to our stockholders. If we have previously qualified as a REIT and fail to qualify as a REIT in any subsequent taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed REIT taxable income.\nWe have elected (or may elect) to treat certain of our existing or newly created corporate subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries (each a \"TRS\"). In general, a TRS of a REIT may hold assets that the REIT cannot hold directly and, subject to certain exceptions related to hotels and healthcare properties, may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. A TRS is treated as a regular corporation and is subject to federal, state, local and foreign taxes on its income and property.\nDeferred Income Taxes - Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities, if any. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A deferred tax asset is also recognized for net operating loss carryforwards of TRS entities. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount that is \"more likely than not\" to be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's TRS entities generating sufficient taxable income in future periods or employing certain tax planning strategies to realize such deferred tax assets. The estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets more likely than not to be realized often requires significant judgment on the part of management because realization may be dependent on the outcome of property sales and/or other events that are difficult to forecast.\nTax Positions - The accounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is \"more likely than not\" that the position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. We have analyzed our various federal and state filing positions and believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions are well documented and supported. There was no reserve for uncertain tax positions recorded as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nSignificant Developments During 2016\nLoan Activity - We originated 23 new loans totaling $97,124,000 (when fully funded) with a weighted average interest rate of 7.67%. We received full or partial repayment on 29 loans in the total amount of $55,764,000 with a weighted average interest rate of 8.0%. We recorded a net increase in specific loan loss allowances on two impaired loans totaling $694,000 and recorded an increase in the general allowance for loan losses of $590,000, for a total of $1,285,000.\nReal Estate Property Sales - We sold seven real estate properties (three partially) for aggregate net sales proceeds of $90,997,000 (including note receivable of $1,595,000) and net gains totaling $24,498,000 ($20,782,000 after portion attributable to non-controlling interest). The sale of one property resulted in the repayment of notes payable totaling $32,881,000.\nReal Estate Construction Projects - We continued the construction of the retail/condominium project owned by ZRV and incurred approximately $24,175,000 in capitalized costs. This project is expected to be completed during the end of the first quarter or beginning of the second quarter of 2017.\nFinancing Activities - We amended the credit and related agreements (the \"CB&T Credit Facility\") with California Bank & Trust (\"CB&T\") and First Bank to increase the maximum potential borrowings from $30,000,000 up to $50,000,000 and to extend the maturity date for borrowings under the facility to March 1, 2018. The amendment also permits the maximum commitment of the lenders, including such additional lenders as may be added by the parties, to be increased up to $75,000,000 if requested by the Company and approved by the lenders. We also repaid all amounts owed under the Secured Revolving Credit Agreement Loan with Opus Bank (the \"Opus Credit Facility\") and the facility has terminated.\nSubsequent Events - The following events have occurred during the first quarter of 2017 and are discussed in further detail in our consolidated financial statements under \"Note 16 - Subsequent Events\" in Item 8 of this Annual Report:\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> We sold the last parcel of unimproved land located in Gypsum, Colorado for net sales proceeds of $139,000 at no gain or loss.\n</td>

The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income from performing loans as the average balance of performing loans increased between 2015 and 2016 by approximately 70%. This increase was partially offset by the fact that the 2015 period included approximately $1,723,000 of interest income collected on an impaired loan that did not recur during 2016.\nRental and other income from real estate properties decreased $4,814,000 (38% decrease) to $7,977,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $12,791,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the sale of four operating properties during 2015 and five during 2016.\nExpenses\nManagement fees increased $1,235,000 (60% increase) and servicing fees increased $112,000 (60% increase) during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, due to an increase in the average balance of loans in our portfolio of 60% during 2016, as compared to 2015.\nThe maximum management and servicing fees were paid to the Manager during years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The maximum management fee permitted under the Company's charter is 2.75% per year of the average unpaid balance of loans and, accordingly, management fees have (and will continue to) increase proportionately as we deploy capital into loans and increase our loan balances. For the years 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the management fees were 2.75%, 2.75%, 2.75%, 2.74% and 2.67% of the average unpaid balance of loans, respectively.\nIn determining whether to take the maximum management fees permitted, the Manager may consider a number of factors, including current market yields, delinquency experience, un-invested cash and real estate activities. During 2016 and 2015, the Manager chose to take the maximum compensation that it is able to take pursuant to the charter and will likely continue to take the maximum compensation for the foreseeable future.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $290,000 (23% increase) during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher legal, consulting, appraisal, director and audit fees during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nRental and other expenses on real estate properties decreased $1,464,000 (17% decrease) during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to the sale of four operating properties during 2015 and five during 2016. This decrease was offset by an increase in property tax expense and other holding costs on the TOTB North apartment building held within TOTB Miami that could no longer be capitalized to the basis of the project once construction was completed in March 2016 (and before it was sold in September 2016) and also due to an increase in marketing related expenses for the ZRV property currently under construction during 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $794,000 (39% decrease) during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to the discontinuation of depreciation on certain properties that were moved to Held for Sale during 2015 and 2016.\nInterest expense increased $921,000 (48% increase) during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015, due to a higher amount of interest incurred on our lines of credit as the balances were higher during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015, due to an additional $3,830,000 advance taken on the TSV loan with RaboBank (the \"TSV Loan\") during the third quarter of 2015 and due to the fact that interest incurred on the TOTB North construction loan could no longer be capitalized to the renovation project beginning in March 2016 as construction was completed (and before it was sold in September 2016).\nThe provision for loan losses of $1,285,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 was the result of an analysis performed on the loan portfolio. The general loan loss allowance increased $590,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in the balance of performing loans during the year, an increase in the historical loss percentage on commercial loans and an increase in land loans in the portfolio which loan segment has a higher loss factor than the other segments. The specific loan loss allowance also increased $694,000 (net) during the year ended December 31, 2016 due primarily to the recording of a specific loan loss allowance of $733,000 as of December 31, 2016 on one impaired loan as a result of an updated analysis of the collateral value completed based on actual sales of units during 2016.\nThe reversal of the provision for loan losses of $1,027,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 was the result of an analysis performed on the loan portfolio. The general loan loss allowance increased $877,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to an increase in the balance of performing loans during the year (net of payoffs). There was also an increase in the balance of both land and residential loans which have a higher historical loss factor for purposes of the general allowance calculation. The specific loan loss allowance decreased $1,904,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015, because new appraisals obtained during 2015 on two impaired loans reflected increased values of the underlying collateral, thus, resulting in a decrease in the specific allowance on these loans.\nThe impairment losses on real estate properties of $3,228,000 and $1,589,000, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were the result of updated appraisals or other valuation information obtained on certain of our real estate properties during those years.\nGain on Sales of Real Estate\nGain on sales of real estate (excluding gain attributable to a non-controlling interest in 2016) increased $2,679,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, as a result of the sale of seven real estate properties during 2016 (three partially), resulting in net gains totaling $24,498,000 (see further detail under \"Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests\" and \"Real Estate Properties Held for Sale and Investment\" below). The gain from the sale of one of these properties was offset by net income attributable to a non-controlling interest of approximately $3,716,000, as a portion of the gain on sale of the property held within TOTB Miami, LLC was attributable to the non-controlling interest. During 2015, we sold eight real estate properties, resulting in gains totaling $21,666,000 and recognized $153,000 of deferred gain under the installment method related to the sale of the condominiums located in Santa Barbara, California in 2012 due to the remaining repayment of the carry back loan during 2015.\nWe believe, from period to period in the near term, there will be fluctuations in net income resulting from the lag time between the sale of our real estate assets and deployment of the proceeds into new loan investments.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit increased $7,342,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, as a result of the transfer of two properties into ZRV and conversion of ZRV into a taxable REIT subsidiary during the second quarter of 2016, which now makes the income (loss) from these real estate assets taxable. Due to differences between the book and tax basis of these assets and net losses experienced to date, a deferred tax asset and related income tax benefit totaling $7,249,000 was recorded as of December 31, 2016. The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 differed from the statutory tax rate because the properties held within the ZRV TRS had differences between their respective book and tax basis and management now projects that the Company will realize the benefits from deferred tax assets related to these basis differences. The Company also has approximately $5,514,000 of net Federal tax losses to date that can be carried forward to offset taxable income in future years. As a result, a $7,249,000 deferred tax benefit was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 (as compared to income tax expense of $93,000 during 2015).\nNet Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests increased $904,000 (34% increase) during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to the sale of the condominium units and renovated apartment building owned by TOTB Miami, LLC during 2016 as a portion of the gain on sale of approximately $3,716,000 was attributable to our joint venture partner in TOTB Miami. During 2015, we sold the shopping center owned by 720 University and a portion of the gain on sale of approximately $2,479,000 was attributable to our joint venture partner in 720 University.\nComparison of Results of Operations for Years Ended 2015 and 2014\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 93:

increased $2,895,000 (54% increase) to $8,277,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $5,382,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to the accretion of the remaining $512,000 discount on an impaired loan as the loan was repaid prior to maturity in the first quarter of 2015, the collection of past due interest related to an impaired loan that we foreclosed on during 2014 of approximately $1,723,000 (as compared to $517,000 that was collected during 2014) and an increase in the average balance of performing loans between 2014 and 2015 of approximately $32,234,000 (96)%.\nRental and other income from real estate properties increased $523,000 (4% increase) to $12,791,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $12,268,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to rental income from a real estate property obtained via foreclosure in December 2014, increased rental rates and/or occupancy on certain of our properties during 2014 and 2015 and increased income from the TSV retail property that was completed and partially occupied during the fourth quarter of 2014, net of the reduction in rental income following the sale of four operating properties during 2015.\nExpenses\nManagement fees amounted to approximately $2,051,000 (19% increase) and $1,727,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Servicing fees amounted to approximately $186,000 (19% increase) and $157,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $382,000 (23% decrease) during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to lower legal, appraisal, consulting and insurance expenses during 2015 as compared to 2014.\nRental and other expenses on real estate properties increased $352,000 (4% increase) during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to expenses incurred on the assisted living facility located in Bensalem, Pennsylvania that was obtained via foreclosure in December 2014 and the completion of the retail complex owned by TSV during the fourth quarter of 2014, and, thus, there was a full year of operating expenses for these properties during 2015. A significant portion of the TSV expenses were charged to tenants as common area maintenance (\"CAM\") reimbursements and reflected in the increase in revenue for the property during the period. These increased expenses were partially offset by a decrease in expenses as a result of the sale of eight properties during 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $203,000 (9% decrease) during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to the sale of five depreciable properties during 2015.\nInterest expense increased $776,000 (67% increase) during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, due to interest incurred on our lines of credit, the loans payable within TOTB and TSV and the amortization of deferred financing costs to interest expense from these debt instruments during the year ended December 31, 2015. All of these debt facilities, other than the CB&T Credit Facility and the Opus Credit Facility, began to incur interest expense subsequent to the third quarter of 2014.\nThe reversal of the provision for loan losses of $1,027,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 was the result of an analysis performed on the loan portfolio. The general loan loss allowance increased $877,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to an increase in the balance of performing loans during the year (net of payoffs). There was also an increase in the balance of both land and residential loans which have a higher historical loss factor for purposes of the general allowance calculation. The specific loan loss allowance decreased $1,904,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015, because new appraisals obtained during 2015 on two impaired loans reflected increased values of the underlying collateral, thus, resulting in a decrease in the specific allowance on these loans.\nThe reversal of the provision for loan losses of $1,870,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014 was the result of an analysis performed on the loan portfolio. The general loan loss allowance decreased $634,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to an increase in performing commercial loans during 2014 and due to refinements in the loss and delinquency factors applied by management to performing loans reflecting the positive trends in the economy from increasing property values over the year. The specific loan loss allowance decreased $1,236,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily because a new appraisal obtained on a $7,535,000 impaired loan reflected an increase in the value of the underlying collateral during 2014, thus, resulting in a decrease in the specific allowance on this loan of $1,248,000.\nThe impairment losses on real estate properties of $1,589,000 and $179,000, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were the result of updated appraisals or other valuation information obtained on certain of our real estate properties during those years.\nGain on Sales of Real Estate\nGain on sales of real estate (excluding gain attributable to a non-controlling interest in 2015) increased $18,575,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2015 was a result of the sale of eight real estate properties during 2015, resulting in gains totaling $21,666,000 (see further detail under \"Real Estate Properties Held for Sale and Investment\" below). We also recognized $153,000 of deferred gain under the installment method related to the sale of the condominiums located in Santa Barbara, California in 2012 due to the remaining repayment of the carry back loan during the first quarter of 2015. The gain from the sale of one of these properties was offset by net income attributable to a non-controlling interest of approximately $2,479,000, as a portion of the gain on sale of the property held within 720 University, LLC was attributable to the non-controlling interest. During 2014, we sold two parcels of land and recognized deferred gains under the installment method in the total amount of $3,242,000.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests increased $2,502,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to the sale of the shopping center owned by 720 University during 2015 as a portion of the gain on sale of approximately $2,479,000 was attributable to our joint venture partner in 720 University.\nFinancial Condition\nDecember 31, 2016 and 2015\nLoan Portfolio\nOur portfolio of loan investments decreased from 56 as of December 31, 2015 to 55 as of December 31, 2016, and the average loan balance increased from $1,906,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $2,358,000 as of December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had two and three impaired loans, respectively, totaling approximately $4,884,000 (3.8% of the portfolio) and $8,694,000 (8.1%), respectively. This included matured loans totaling $4,656,000 and $8,452,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, seven loans of approximately $8,686,000 (6.7%) were past maturity but less than ninety days delinquent in monthly payments as of December 31, 2016 (combined total of $13,570,000 (10.5%) and $8,694,000 (8.1%), respectively, that are past maturity and impaired). Of the impaired and past maturity loans, none were in the process of foreclosure and none involved loans to borrowers who were in bankruptcy. We foreclosed on one loan during the year ended December 31, 2016 with a principal balance of approximately $1,079,000 and obtained the property via the trustee sale. We foreclosed on no loans during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOf the $8,694,000 in loans that were impaired as of December 31, 2015, $7,615,000 remained impaired in 2016 (balance of $4,884,000 as of December 31, 2016) and one loan with a principal balance of $1,079,000 was foreclosed upon during 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately $129,454,000 (99.8%) and $106,502,000 (99.8%) of our loans are interest only and/or require the borrower to make a \"balloon payment\" on the principal amount upon maturity of the loan. To the extent that a borrower has an obligation to pay loan principal in a large lump sum payment, its ability to satisfy this obligation may be dependent upon its ability to sell the property, obtain suitable refinancing or otherwise raise a substantial cash amount. As a result, these loans involve a higher risk of default than fully amortizing loans. Borrowers occasionally are not able to pay the full amount due at the maturity date. We may allow these borrowers to continue making the regularly scheduled monthly payments for certain periods of time to assist the borrower in meeting the balloon payment obligation without formally filing a notice of default. These loans for which the principal and any accrued interest is due and payable, but the borrower has failed to make such payment of principal and/or accrued interest are referred to as \"past maturity loans\". As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had eight and two past maturity loans totaling approximately $13,342,000 and $8,452,000, respectively.\nThere were no loans modified as troubled debt restructurings during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the terms of one impaired loan were modified as a troubled debt restructuring. The loan was rewritten as the borrower had previously paid the principal balance down partially from sale proceeds. The maturity date was extended by six months to April 2015. All other terms of the loan remained the same. The loan was repaid in full during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we held the following types of loan investments:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The Northern California region (which includes Monterey, Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Inyo counties and all counties north) is a large geographic area which has a diversified economic base. The ability of borrowers to repay loans is influenced by the economic strength of the region and the impact of prevailing market conditions on the value of real estate.\nOur investment in loans increased by $22,839,000 (21%) during the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of new loan originations during the year, net of loan payoffs and one loan foreclosure. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had twenty-two and twenty-four construction/rehabilitation loans in our portfolio with aggregate outstanding principal balances totaling $46,330,000 and $34,416,000, respectively.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses increased (decreased) by approximately $864,000, $(1,027,000) and $(1,870,000) (provsion, net of reversals and charge-offs) during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Manager believes that the allowance for loan losses is sufficient given the estimated underlying collateral values of impaired loans. There is no precise method used by the Manager to predict delinquency rates or losses on specific loans. The Manager has considered the number and amount of delinquent loans, loans subject to workout agreements and loans in bankruptcy in determining allowances for loan losses, but there can be no absolute assurance that the allowance is sufficient. Because any decision regarding the allowance for loan losses reflects judgment about the probability of future events, there is an inherent risk that such judgments will prove incorrect. In such event, actual losses may exceed (or be less than) the amount of any reserve. To the extent that we experience losses greater than the amount of its reserves, we may incur a charge to earnings that will adversely affect operating results and the amount of any dividends paid.\nChanges in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance, beginning of period\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,842,446\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,869,355\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,739,088\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for (reversal of) loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1,284,896\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,026,909\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (1,869,733\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Charge-offs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (447,520\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recoveries\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 27,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance, end of period\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,706,822\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,842,446\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,869,355\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, there was a general allowance for loan losses of $1,974,110 and $1,356,623, respectively, and a specific allowance for loan losses on one loan in the amount of $732,712 and $485,823, respectively.\nReal Estate Properties Held for Sale and Investment\nAs of December 31, 2016, we held title to twenty-two properties that were acquired through foreclosure, with a total carrying amount of approximately $113,123,000 (including properties held in five limited liability companies and three corporations), net of accumulated depreciation of $3,151,000. As of December 31, 2016, properties held for sale total $75,843,000 and properties held for investment total $37,280,000. We foreclosed on one loan during the year ended December 31, 2016 with a principal balance of approximately $1,079,000 and obtained the property via the trustee sale. We foreclosed on no loans during the year ended December 31, 2015. When we acquire property by foreclosure, we typically earn less income on those properties than could be earned on loans and we may not be able to sell the properties in a timely manner.\nChanges in real estate held for sale and investment during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance, beginning of period\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 153,838,412\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 163,016,805\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 135,315,964\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate acquired through foreclosure\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 700,800\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,572,406\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investments in real estate properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 29,061,735\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,274,125\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21,866,298\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred financing costs capitalized to construction project\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 119,471\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 207,347\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 120,952\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales of real estate properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (66,183,589\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (31,099,086\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (1,529,227\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment losses on real estate properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (3,227,807\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (1,589,434\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (179,040\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation of properties held for investment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (1,185,624\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (1,971,345\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (2,150,548\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance, end of period\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 113,123,398\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 153,838,412\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 163,016,805\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThirteen of our twenty-two properties do not currently generate revenue.

The Company expects that new leases will be signed with existing or new tenants for the majority of these spaces and at rental rates that are at market and are at or above expiring rental amounts.\nFor purposes of assessing potential impairment of value during 2016, 2015 and 2014, we obtained updated appraisals or other valuation support on several of our real estate properties held for sale and investment, which resulted in additional impairment losses on three, one and one properties, respectively, in the aggregate amount of approximately $3,228,000, $1,589,000 and $179,000, respectively, recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\n2016 Sales Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold seven real estate properties (two partially) with details as follows:\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Net Sales Proceeds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Gain (Loss)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Light industrial building, Paso Robles, California\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,023,679\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,557,979\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial building in building complex, Roseville, California\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 455,132\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 280,836\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 169 condominium units and 160 unit renovated and unoccupied apartment building, Miami, Florida (held within TOTB Miami, LLC)*\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 74,072,951\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19,292,364\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 61 condominium units, Lakewood, Washington (held within Phillips Road, LLC)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,030,384\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 846,998\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2 improved, residential lots, Auburn, California (held within Zalanta Resort at the Village, LLC)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 186,353\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 89,675\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medical office condominium complex, Gilbert, Arizona (held within Zalanta Resort at the Village, LLC)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,793,870\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (30,010\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unimproved, residential and commercial land, Gypsum, Colorado (three separate sales)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,434,273\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (540,079\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 90,966,642\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,497,763\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n* $32,881,000 of proceeds were used to pay off debt securing the properties and $7,934,000 was distributed to the non-controlling interest.\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn September, 2016, TSV entered into a Purchase Agreement, as amended by Addendum 2, with Jianping Pan, Kawana Holdings LLC which has assigned its rights to Tahoe Chateau Land Holdings, LLC, a California limited liability company (the \"Buyer\"). Pursuant to the amended Purchase Agreement, TSV has agreed to sell to Buyer the approximately 8.0 acres of land and entitlements, including related parking and garage structures, owned by TSV in South Lake Tahoe, California, commonly known as The Chateau at the Village as further described in the Purchase Agreement (the \"Purchased Property\") for a total of $42.5 million, net of seller's credit which includes sales commissions (the \"Purchase Price\"). The property to be sold does not include the existing retail buildings and improvements (the \"Retained Property\").\nThe closing (the \"Closing\") of the transaction is subject to a number of conditions including, among others, a requirement that the responsible agency for the City of South Lake Tahoe, California approve a final subdivision map that is recorded establishing the Purchased Property and the Retained Property as separate legal parcels (the \"Final Subdivision Map\"). If the Final Subdivision Map is not recorded by March 31, 2017, the Closing date will be extended up to 60 days to allow TSV additional time to record the map. If, after such extension, the Final Subdivision Map is not recorded but all other closing conditions are satisfied, Addendum 2 provides that the Closing will be held with respect to the overall property, including the Purchased Property and the Retained Property, with the Retained Property to be conveyed back to TSV upon recording the Final Subdivision Map. There can be no assurance if or when the sale of the Purchased Property will be consummated.\nBuyer has paid $13,000,000 as a refundable deposit into escrow. Of this deposit, $3,000,000 has been released as a seller's credit out of escrow to pay certain Buyer expenses. The additional $32.5 million of Purchase Price is to be paid in cash at Closing.\nAs a result of the execution of the Purchase Agreement, the Company transferred approximately $6,066,000 of land basis from the first phase retail property (currently held for investment) to the second phase land being sold with this transaction.

The gain on the sale of this property was being accounted for under the installment method.\n2014 Sales Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold two real estate properties with details as follows:\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Net Sales Proceeds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Gain\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Undeveloped commercial land, Half Moon Bay, California\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,647,130\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 178,330\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Improved residential lot, West Sacramento, California\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 163,540\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 104,980\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,810,670\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 283,310\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the above table, we recognized gains totaling approximately $2,951,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014 that had previously been deferred related to the sales of a real estate properties in 2012 and 2013. The gains on the sales of these properties were being accounted for under the installment method.\n2016 Foreclosure Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company foreclosed on one loan secured by an office property located in Oakdale, California with a principal balance of approximately $1,079,000 and obtained the property via the trustee's sale. In addition, accrued interest and advances made on the loan (for items such as legal fees and delinquent property taxes) in the total amount of approximately $70,000 were capitalized to the basis of the property. A specific loan allowance has been previously established on this loan of approximately $495,000. This amount was then recorded as a charge-off against the allowance for loan losses at the time of foreclosure, after a reduction of the previously established allowance in the amount of approximately $47,000 as a result of an updated appraisal obtained (net charge-off of $448,000). The property, along with a unit in the building purchased by the Company in 2015, was contributed into a new taxable REIT subsidiary, East G, LLC, in June 2016. The property is classified as held for sale as a sale is expected to be completed within a one year period.\n2015 Foreclosure Activity\nThe Company foreclosed on no loans during the year ended December 31, 2015.\n2014 Foreclosure Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, Sandmound Marina, LLC (\"Sandmound\") (wholly owned by the Company) foreclosed on a first mortgage loan secured by unimproved land and a marina and campground located in Bethel Island, California with a principal balance of approximately $2,960,000 and obtained the properties via the trustee's sale.In addition, advances made on the loan or incurred as part of the foreclosure in the total amount of approximately $282,000 were capitalized to the basis of the properties. The fair market values of the properties acquired were estimated to be higher than Sandmound's recorded investment in the subject loan, and, thus, a gain on foreclosure in the amount of approximately $257,000 was recorded.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company foreclosed on a first mortgage loan secured by two adjacent, vacant buildings located in San Jose, California with a principal balance of approximately $690,000 and obtained the properties via the trustee's sale.In addition, accrued interest and advances made on the loan or incurred as part of the foreclosure in the total amount of approximately $158,000 were capitalized to the basis of the properties. The fair market values of the properties acquired were estimated to be higher than the Company's recorded investment in the subject loan, and, thus, a gain on foreclosure in the amount of approximately $208,000 was recorded.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company foreclosed on a second mortgage loan secured by an assisted living facility located in Bensalem, Pennsylvania with a principal balance of approximately $3,420,000 and obtained the property via the trustee's sale.In addition, advances made on the loan or incurred as part of the foreclosure in the total amount of approximately $519,000 were capitalized to the basis of the property. In 2012, the Company had purchased the first mortgage loan on this property which it became subject to at the time of foreclosure. Thus, the Company's investment in this loan of approximately $1,079,000 was added to the basis of the property. The fair market value of the property acquired was estimated to approximate the Company's recorded investments in the subject loans.\nMajority-Owned Limited Liability Companies\n720 University, LLC\nWe had an investment in a limited liability company, 720 University, LLC (720 University), which owned a commercial retail property located in Greeley, Colorado. We received 65% of the profits and losses in 720 University after priority return on partner contributions was allocated at the rate of 10% per annum. The assets, liabilities, income and expenses of 720 University were consolidated into the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company.\nIn November 2014, 720 University entered into a Real Estate Sale Agreement pursuant to which 720 University agreed to sell the property for $20,750,000. On January 30, 2015, an initial closing was held for the purpose of refinancing the existing 720 University note payable, and the buyer extended a new loan to 720 University to repay the existing note payable to the bank. The principal amount of the new loan was $9,771,263 and accrued interest at 6.0% per annum until paid off upon the closing of the sale of the property to the buyer. The sale closed in June 2015 resulting in gain on sale of approximately $8,642,000 ($6,163,000 to the Company after the gain attributable to the non-controlling interest or approximately $2,479,000).\nThe net income to the Company from 720 University was approximately $6,437,000 and $355,000 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The non-controlling interest of the joint venture partner of approximately $5,000 as of December 31, 2015 is reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 720 University was dissolved in December 2015.\nTOTB Miami, LLC\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company and two co-lenders (which included OFG and PRC Treasures, LLC, or PRC) foreclosed on a participated, first mortgage loan secured by a condominium complex located in Miami, Florida with a principal balance to the Company of approximately $26,257,000 and obtained an undivided interest in the properties via the trustee's sale. The Company and the other lenders formed a Florida limited liability company, TOTB Miami, to own and operate the complex. The complex consisted of three buildings, two of which were renovated and being leased, and in which 169 units remained unsold and one which has been contributed to a wholly-owned subsidiary of TOTB, TOTB North, and contained 160 vacant units that were recently renovated.\nIn March 2012, we made a priority capital contribution to TOTB in the amount of $7,200,000. TOTB then purchased PRC's member interest in TOTB for $7,200,000. Thus, the remaining members in TOTB are now the Company and OFG. On the same date, the Company and OFG executed an amendment to the TOTB operating agreement to set the percentage of capital held by each at 80.74% for the Company and 19.26% for OFG based on the dollar amount of capital invested in TOTB. Income and loss allocations were made based on these percentages.\nDuring 2014, TOTB contributed the vacant and unimproved 160 unit apartment building to a new wholly-owned entity, TOTB North. TOTB North then entered into a construction loan agreement which provided up to $21,304,000 for the purpose of renovating and improving the apartment building. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the balance on the construction loan was approximately $0 and $16,010,000, respectively. The construction project was substantially completed in March 2016. The loan was repaid in full with the closing of the sale of the TOTB property in September 2016 (see below).\nDuring 2014, TOTB entered into a loan agreement whereby it borrowed $13,000,000 secured by the 154 renovated and leased condominium units in the Pointe building. The outstanding balance as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $0 and $12,693,000, respectively. The loan bore interest at the floating daily three month LIBOR rate of interest plus 4.0% per annum, but in no event lower than 4.25%. Principal and interest was payable monthly with principal amortizing over 300 months. The loan was repaid in full with the closing of the sale of the TOTB property in September 2016 (see below).\nAll of the TOTB and TOTB North properties were sold in September 2016 for net sales proceeds of approximately $74,073,000, resulting in gain of approximately $19,292,000 ($15,577,000 to the Company after the gain attributable to the non-controlling interest of approximately $3,716,000).\nThe non-controlling interest of OFG totaled approximately $0 and $4,524,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The net income to the Company from TOTB was approximately $14,977,000, $311,000 and $573,000 during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nEquity Method Investment in Limited Liability Company\n1850 De La Cruz, LLC\nDuring 2008, we entered into an Operating Agreement of 1850 De La Cruz LLC, a California limited liability company (\"1850\"), with Nanook Ventures LLC (\"Nanook\"), an unrelated party. The purpose of the joint venture is to acquire, own and operate certain industrial land and buildings located in Santa Clara, California that were owned by the Company. At the time of closing in July 2008, the two properties were separately contributed to two new limited liability companies, Nanook Ventures One LLC and Nanook Ventures Two LLC that are wholly owned by 1850. The Company and Nanook are the Members of 1850 and NV Manager, LLC is the manager.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we received capital distributions from 1850 in the total amount of $180,000, $177,000 and $170,000, respectively. The net income to the Company from its investment in 1850 De La Cruz was approximately $179,000, $175,000 and $170,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased from approximately $8,481,000 as of December 31, 2015 to approximately $6,934,000 as of December 31, 2016 ($1,547,000 or 18% decrease) due primarily to cash used totaling $137,626,000 for investment in loans and real estate properties, net repayment of debt and dividends paid, which was offset by cash received totaling $137,107,000 from the sale of real estate properties (net of distributions to non-controlling interest) and principal collected on loans. In addition, the Company used $943,000 in cash for operating activities during 2016.\nInterest and Other Receivables\nInterest and other receivables increased from approximately $1,765,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $2,164,000 as of December 31, 2016 ($399,000 or 23% increase) due primarily to an additional unsecured loan of $250,000 made to our tenant in the assisted care facility located in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. The tenant is in the process of transitioning the facility and business to memory care in order to increase occupancy and income on the property and needed funds to continue to operate during this transition. The remaining increase was due primarily to growth in the loan portfolio during the year.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nDeferred financing costs accounted for as assets increased from approximately $126,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $172,000 as of December 31, 2016 ($46,000 or 36% increase) due primarily to a new origination fee and other loan costs paid on the amended CB&T Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2016, net of amortization of such costs.\nDeferred Tax Assets, Net\nDeferred tax assets increased from $0 as of December 31, 2015 to approximately $7,249,000 as of December 31, 2016 due to the transfer of two properties into ZRV and the conversion of ZRV into a TRS during the second quarter of 2016, which now makes the income (loss) from these real estate assets taxable. Due to temporary differences between the book and tax basis of these assets and net operating losses to date, a deferred tax asset and related income tax benefit totaling approximately $7,249,000 was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDividends Payable\nDividends payable decreased from approximately $2,133,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $1,402,000 as of\nDecember 31, 2016 ($731,000 or 34% decrease) primarily due to a decrease in Federal income taxes paid on undistributed capital gains on behalf of shareholders. In January 2016 a tax payment in the amount $1,314,000 was made (for 2015 undistributed capital gains), whereas in January 2017 a tax payment in the amount of $583,000 was made (for 2016 undistributed capital gains).\nAccounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities increased from approximately $3,359,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $3,700,000 as of December 31, 2016 ($341,000 or 10% increase), due primarily to increased payables related to the construction activities on the property owned by ZRV.\nLines of Credit Payable\nLines of credit payable decreased from $20,916,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $4,976,000 as of December 31 2016 ($15,940,000 or 76% decrease) due primarily to repayments on the lines of credit as a result of net proceeds received on the sales of real estate properties, net of new loan investments during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNotes and Loans Payable on Real Estate\nNotes and loans payable decreased from approximately $45,459,000 as of December 31, 2015 to approximately $33,386,000 as of December 31, 2016 ($12,073,000 or 27% decrease) due primarily to the repayment in full of the TOTB Miami and TOTB North loans totaling approximately $32,881,000 as a result of the sale of the related properties during the year ended December 31, 2016, repayment of two notes payable secured by TSV and ZRV real estate totaling $3,400,000, net of an increase in debt of approximately $19,897,000 from the new ZRV construction loan obtained during the year.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests decreased from approximately $4,529,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $0 as of December 31, 2016 ($4,529,000 or 100% decrease), due to the sale of the properties owned by TOTB Miami and the distribution of net proceeds to the non-controlling interest during the year ended December 31, 2016. The TOTB Miami LLC was dissolved in December 2016.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFunds from Operations\nWe utilize supplemental non-GAAP measures of operating performance, including funds from operations (\"FFO\"), an industry-wide standard measure of REIT operating performance, and adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\"). We believe FFO and AFFO provide investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We determine FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"), as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding real estate-related depreciation and amortization, impairment losses on depreciable real estate, gains or losses on the sales of depreciable real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated ventures.\nWe calculate AFFO by adding or subtracting from FFO the impact of non-cash accounting items, as well as gains/losses on sales of other real estate. We adjust for these items to analyze our ability to produce cash flow from on-going operations, which we use to pay dividends to our shareholders. Non-cash adjustments to FFO include the following: provisions for (reversals of) loan losses; amortization of deferred financing costs; depreciation of other assets; impairment of other real estate; accretion of loan discount; gain on foreclosure of loans; straight-line rental adjustments and deferred income tax benefit.\nOur calculations of FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other REITs. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income as a measure of our operating performance or to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity, nor are they indicative of cash flows from operating and financial activities.\nWe urge investors to carefully review the GAAP financial information included as part of the Annual Report, as well as in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and quarterly earnings releases.\nThe following table reconciles FFO and AFFO to comparable GAAP financial measures:\nTable 103: <table> <tr>

experienced and that the amount of such losses will vary from time to time, depending on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as affected by economic conditions and the financial experiences of borrowers. Many of these factors are beyond the control of the Company or its management. There is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on specific loans or on segments of the loan portfolio.\nThe conclusion that a Company loan may become uncollectible, in whole or in part, is a matter of judgment. Although supervised lenders are subject to regulations that, among other things, require them to perform ongoing analyses of their loan portfolios (including analyses of loan-to-value ratios, reserves, etc.), and to obtain current information regarding their borrowers and the securing properties, we are not subject to these regulations and have not adopted these practices. Rather, management, in connection with the quarterly closing of our accounting records and the preparation of the financial statements, evaluates our loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on management's evaluation of the risk inherent in our loan portfolio and current economic conditions. Such evaluation, which includes a review of all loans on which management determines that full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers among other matters:\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> prevailing economic conditions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> our historical loss experience;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the types and dollar amounts of loans in the portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> borrowers' financial condition and adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to pay;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> evaluation of industry trends;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> review and evaluation of loans identified as having loss potential; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> estimated net realizable value or fair value of the underlying collateral.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased upon this evaluation, a determination is made as to whether the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable incurred credit losses in the Company's loan portfolio. Additions to the allowance for loan losses are made by charges to the provision for loan losses. Loan losses deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses. As of December 31, 2016, management believes that the allowance for loan losses of approximately $2,707,000 is adequate in amount to cover probable incurred credit losses. Because of the number of variables involved, the magnitude of the swings possible and management's inability to control many of these factors, actual results may and do sometimes differ significantly from estimates made by management. As of December 31, 2016, two loans totaling approximately $4,884,000 were impaired. One of these loans of approximately $4,656,000 was past maturity as of December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a net increase in the allowance for loan losses of approximately $864,000 (increase in the specific allowance of $694,000, increase in the general allowance of approximately $591,000, recovery of $27,000, net of charge-off of approximately $448,000). Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is sufficient given the estimated fair value of the collateral underlying impaired and past maturity loans and based on historical loss and delinquency factors applied to performing loans by class.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions to our stockholders and other general business needs.\nWe believe our available cash and restricted cash balances, other financing arrangements, and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months.\nWe require liquidity to:\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> fund future loan investments;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> to develop, improve and maintain real estate properties;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> to repay principal and interest on our borrowings;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> to pay our expenses, including compensation to our Manager;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> to pay U.S. federal, state, and local taxes of our TRSs;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> to distribute annually a minimum of 90% of our REIT taxable income and to make investments in a manner that enables us to maintain our qualification as a REIT; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> to make tax payments associated with undistributed capital gains.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe intend to meet these liquidity requirements primarily through the following:\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> the use of our cash and cash equivalent balances of $434,000 as of December 31, 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> cash generated from operating activities, including interest income from our loan portfolio and income generated from our real estate properties;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> proceeds from the sales of real estate properties;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> proceeds from our line of credit;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> proceeds from future borrowings including additional lines of credit;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> proceeds from the construction loan obtained by ZRV for construction of a new mixed-use retail and residential building; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> proceeds from potential future offerings of our equity securities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented:\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (943,292\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,880,684\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,967,167\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 41,447,991\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (9,376,732\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (38,875,451\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (41,326,298\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 3,338,345\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 29,163,095\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately $822,000 and $158,000, respectively. The decrease during 2016 was primarily due to more cash used for investments in loans and real estate properties and net repayment of debt as compared to cash received from the sales of real estate properties and principal payments on loans during the year. The decrease during 2015 was primarily due to investments in new loans and capitalized costs related to construction on the second phase retail/residential portion of the land now owned by Zalanta, net of proceeds from the sales of eight real estate properties during the year.\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities are primarily rental and other income from real estate properties, net of real estate expenses, and interest received from our investments in loans, partially offset by payment of operating expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, cash flows from operating activities decreased $6,824,000 and increased $2,914,000, respectively, as compared to the previous year. The decrease during 2016 reflects decreased cash flow from rental properties as a result of the sale of four operating properties during 2015 and five during 2016 and higher management and service fees, general and administrative expenses and interest expense during 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase during 2015 was due to increased cash flow from rental properties as a result of increased occupancy and rental rates, completion and leasing of the TSV retail complex during the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased interest income on performing loans and collected on impaired loans during 2015.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the periods presented reflect our investing activity. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, cash flows from investing activities increased $50,825,000 and $29,499,000, respectively, as compared to the previous year. Approximately $41,448,000 was provided by investing activities during 2016 as $145,977,000 was received from the sales of real estate properties, the payoff of loans and transfer from restricted cash, which was partially offset by an aggregate of $104,679,000 that was used for investment in loans and improvements to real estate properties during the year. Approximately $9,377,000 was used in investing activities during 2015 as an aggregate of $93,324,000 was used for investment in loans, improvements to real estate properties and transfer to restricted cash, which was partially offset by net proceeds from the sales of real estate properties and the payoff of loans totaling $83,818,000 during the period.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities during 2016 totaled approximately $41,326,000 and consisted primarily of $28,354,000 of net repayments on our lines of credit and notes payable, $8,144,000 of distributions to non-controlling interests and $4,593,000 of dividends paid to stockholders. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2015 of approximately $3,338,000 reflects net advances on CB&T and Opus Credit Facilities of $9,466,000, $28,603,000 in additional borrowings on notes and loans payable and a $279,000 contribution from non-controlling interest, net of dividends paid to stockholders of approximately $4,817,000, distribution of non-controlling interest of $2,592,000, purchase of treasury stock pursuant to the 2015 Repurchase Plan of $7,503,000, payment of deferred financing costs of $42,000 and repayments of notes payable of $20,056,000.\nDividends\nWe intend to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our Common Stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT annually distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its REIT taxable income, including capital gains, in any taxable year, that it pay tax at regular corporate rates on that undistributed portion. We intend to make regular quarterly distributions to our stockholders in an amount equal to or greater than our REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains, if and to the extent authorized by our Board of Directors. Before we make any distributions, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our REIT taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured investment vehicles, special purpose entities or VIEs, established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intend to provide additional funding to any such entities.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe table below summarizes our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 and in future periods in which we expect to settle such obligations. The table does not reflect the effect of actual repayments or draws on the obligations or any new financing obtained subsequent to year end.\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

In consideration of the management services rendered to the Company, OFG is entitled to receive from the Company a management fee payable monthly, subject to a maximum of 2.75% per annum of the average unpaid balance of the mortgage loans at the end of each month in the calendar year. In addition, OFG in is also entitled to a monthly loan servicing fee, which, when added to all other fees paid in connection with the servicing of a particular loan, does not exceed the lesser of the customary, competitive fee paid in the community where the loan is placed for the provision of such services on that type of loan, or up to 0.25% per annum of the unpaid principle balance of the loans. Pursuant to the charter, OFG also receives all late payment charges from borrowers on loans owned by the Company, as well as, other miscellaneous fees which are collected from loan payments, loan payoffs or advances from loan principal, payable in cash on a monthly basis following the end of each month.\nIn addition, OFG is reimbursed by the Company for the actual cost of goods, services and materials used for or by the Company and paid by OFG and the salary and related salary expense of OFG's non-management and non-supervisory personnel performing services for the Company which could be performed by independent parties, including tax, accounting, and legal expenses (subject to certain limitations in the Management Agreement). Expense reimbursements to OFG are made in cash on a monthly basis following the end of each month. The Company's reimbursement obligation is not subject to any dollar limitation.\nThe Management Agreement and the terms of the charter compensation and expense reimbursement shall remain in effect for the duration of the existence of the Company, unless earlier terminated by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, automatically, or by OFG, or by the Company in accordance with the Agreement.\nCompany Debt\nThe terms of the Company debt are discussed in further detail in our consolidated financial statements under \"Note 7 - Lines of Credit Payable\" and \"Note 8 - Notes and Loans Payable on Real Estate\" in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nCB&T Line of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company has one credit facility. The total amount available to borrow under the CB&T Credit Facility was $22,625,000 and the balance outstanding was $4,976,000 (leaving $17,649,000 available). As of March 10, 2017, the total amount available to borrow under the CB&T Credit Facility is $41,182,000 and the balance outstanding is $13,314,000 (leaving $27,868,000 available). Interest on borrowings under the CB&T Credit Facility are payable monthly and, as a result of the amendment to the facility entered into in March 2016 to expand the line of credit and extend its maturity, all amounts outstanding under the facility are to be repaid not later than March 1, 2018 and advances may be made up to that date.\nTahoe Stateline Venture, LLC Loan Payable\nThe balance of the TSV Loan was approximately $13,635,000 as of December 31, 2016 and $13,538,000 as of March 10, 2017. TSV borrowed $10,445,000 at the first closing under the TSV Loan and an additional $3,830,000 in September 2015. TSV makes monthly payments of principal and accrued interest and the balance of the loan is due on the maturity date, which is January 1, 2021.\nZRV Construction Loan\nThe construction loan among ZRV and ZRV II as the Borrowers and Western Alliance Bank as the lender (the \"ZRV Loan\") will provide the Borrowers up to $31,000,000, subject to the terms and conditions of the loan, for the purposes of financing the construction of a new mixed-use retail and residential building (the \"Project\") in South Lake Tahoe, California. The balance of the ZRV Loan was approximately $20,214,000 as of December 31, 2016 and approximately $23,408,000 as of March 10, 2017. Monthly interest only payments are required from an established interest reserve. In addition, on the last day of the calendar quarter in which a Certificate of Occupancy is obtained with respect to completion of the first condominium in the Project, and, continuing on the last day of each calendar quarter thereafter during the term of the Loan, $6 million of principal is required to be repaid. The balance of the ZRV Loan is due on August 3, 2018.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have commitments to advance additional funds to borrowers of construction, rehabilitation and other loans (including interest reserves) in the total amount of approximately $31,490,000.\nWe have entered into various contracts for design, architectural, engineering, foundation work and construction for the development of the land owned by ZRV. The aggregate amount of these contracts as of the date of this filing is approximately $33,809,000 of which approximately $26,013,000 has been incurred as of December 31, 2016 in addition to other capitalized costs related to the construction project of $3,801,000 (total of $29,814,000). We expect that all costs for this project will be paid from the construction loan or cash reserves. It is possible that additional change orders will be submitted and construction costs may be higher than expected.\nWe have entered into various contracts for design, architectural and engineering for the development of the land owned by ZRV II. The aggregate amount of these contracts totaled approximately $1,021,000 of which approximately $845,000 had been incurred as of December 31, 2016 in addition to other capitalized costs related to the project of $265,000 (total of $1,110,000). We expect that all costs for this phase of the project will be paid from cash reserves and/or advances from the CB&T Credit Facility. It is possible that additional change orders will be submitted and costs may be higher than expected.\nContingency Reserves\nWe are required to maintain cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as contingency reserves in an aggregate amount of at least 1.50% of Capital (as defined in our charter). Although the Manager believes the contingency reserves are adequate, it could become necessary for us to sell or otherwise liquidate certain of our investments or other assets to cover such contingencies on terms which might not be favorable to the Company. The contingency reserves held in restricted cash were approximately $3,738,000 and $3,809,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"plan,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue\" and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, uncertain events or assumptions, and other characterizations of future events, strategies or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. All forward-looking statements and reasons why results may differ included in this Form 10-K are made as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statement or reason why actual results may differ.\nOverview and Background\nWe are a specialty finance company that focuses on the origination, investment and management of commercial real estate loans primarily in the Western U.S. We provide customized, short-term capital to small and middle-market investors and developers who require speed and flexibility. We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are externally managed and advised by OFG, a specialized commercial real estate management company that has originated, serviced and managed alternative commercial real estate investments since 1951.\nThe Company is a Maryland corporation formed to reorganize the business of its predecessor, OMIF, into a publicly traded REIT. Beginning in 2009, OMIF experienced liquidity issues as its borrowers were unable to access credit sources to pay off its loans. OMIF eventually foreclosed on a substantial portion of its loan portfolio, repositioning many of the properties for investment or eventual sale. OMIF also experienced a significant increase in capital withdrawal requests that it was unable to honor due to insufficient cash, net of reserves, and restrictions under the terms of its bank line of credit. In addition, OMIF was restricted by provisions within the partnership agreement from making additional investments in loans while qualified redemption requests remained pending and unpaid. In addition to increasing investor liquidity through public listing of its stock, the Company was created to provide the opportunity for resuming mortgage lending activities, with the goal of increasing income to stockholders.\nOn May 20, 2013, OMIF merged with and into the Company with the Company as the surviving corporation, succeeding to and continuing the business and operations of OMIF. The Company now, by virtue of the Merger, directly or indirectly owns all of the assets and business formerly owned by OMIF. The Company is a deemed successor issuer to OMIF pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act, and on July 1, 2013, the Company's Common Stock was listed on the NYSE MKT exchange. For accounting purposes, the Merger has been treated as a transfer of assets and exchange of shares between entities under common control. The accounting basis used to initially record the assets and liabilities in the Company is the carryover basis of OMIF. OMIF was a California Limited Partnership registered with the SEC that was formed in 1983 for the purposes of funding and servicing short-term commercial real estate loans.\nOur primary sources of revenue are interest income earned on our loan investment portfolio and revenues we generate from our operating real estate assets. We have resumed originating loans and believe the Company is well positioned to capitalize on lending opportunities as the economy continues to recover. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to identify and make loans to suitable commercial real estate borrowers or have adequate capital and liquidity to fund such loans.\nOur operating results are affected primarily by:\n \u00b7 the level of foreclosures and related loan and real estate losses experienced; \n \u00b7 the income or losses from foreclosed properties prior to the time of disposal, and our ability to dispose of those properties in a timely manner; \n \u00b7 the amount of cash available to invest in loans; \n \u00b7 the amount of borrowing to finance loan investments and our cost of funds on such borrowing; \n \u00b7 the level of real estate lending activity in the markets serviced; \n \u00b7 the ability to identify and lend to suitable borrowers; \n \u00b7 the interest rates we are able to charge on loans; and \n \u00b7 the level of delinquencies on loans. \nBetween 2008 and 2013, we experienced increased delinquent loans and foreclosures which created substantial losses. As a result, we also owned significantly more real estate than in the past, which has reduced cash flow and net income. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 4% of our loans were impaired and/or past maturity, down from 8% as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we owned approximately $113 million of real estate held for sale or investment, which is approximately 44% of total assets, a decrease of $40.7 million or 15% of total assets as compared to December 31, 2015. During 2016, we sold seven real estate properties (three partial) for aggregate net sales proceeds of $90,997,000 (including note receivable of $1,595,000) and net gains totaling $24,498,000 ($20,782,000 to the Company after $3,716,000 gain attributable to non-controlling interest). We will continue to attempt to sell certain of our properties but may need to sell them for losses or wait until market values fully recover. In addition, under the REIT tax rules, we may be subject to a \"prohibited transaction\" penalty tax on tax gains from the sale of our properties in certain circumstances. In addition, we are also limited in the number and dollar amount of properties we can sell in a given year under the REIT tax rules.\nAlthough currently management believes that only one of our delinquent loans will result in loss to the Company (and has caused the Company to record a specific allowance for loan losses on such loan), real estate values could decrease further. Management continues to perform frequent evaluations of collateral values for our loans using internal and external sources, including the use of updated independent appraisals. As a result of these evaluations, the allowance for loan losses and our investments in real estate could increase or decrease in the near term, and such changes could be material.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur primary business objective is to provide our stockholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns by producing consistent and predictable dividends while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We believe we have positioned the Company for future growth and seek to increase funds from operations, or FFO, and distributions to stockholders through active portfolio management and execution of our business plan which is outlined below:\n \u00b7 Capitalize on market lending opportunity by leveraging existing origination network to expand our commercial real estate loan portfolio. \n \u00b7 Enhance and reposition our commercial real estate assets through the investment of capital and strategic management. \n \u00b7 Increase liquidity available for lending activities by focusing on opportunities to remove real estate assets from our balance sheet. \n \u00b7 Manage leverage to marginally expand sources of liquidity while maintaining a conservative balance sheet. \nCurrent Market Conditions, Risks and Recent Trends\nOur ability to execute our business strategy, particularly the growth of our loan portfolio, is dependent on many factors, including our ability to sell our real estate assets in a timely manner and access financing on favorable terms. The previous economic downturn had a significant negative impact on both us and our borrowers. If similar economic conditions recur in the future, it may limit our options to sell our real estate assets, obtaining financing on favorable terms or otherwise obtain necessary capital to make new loans, and may also adversely impact the creditworthiness of our borrowers which could result in their inability to repay their loans.\nThe commercial real estate markets continue to improve, but uncertainty remains as a result of global market instability, the current political climate and other matters and their potential impact on the U.S. economy and commercial real estate markets. In addition, the growth in multifamily rental rates seen over the past few years are showing signs of stabilizing. If real estate values decline again and/or rent growth subsides, it may limit our new loan originations since borrowers often use increases in the value of, and revenues produced from, their existing properties to support the purchase or investment in additional properties. Declining real estate values may also significantly increase the likelihood that we will have difficulty selling our existing real estate assets in a timely manner, and that we will incur losses on our loans in the event of default because the value of our collateral may be insufficient to cover our investment in the loan. Any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could adversely affect both our interest income from loans as well as our ability to originate loans, which would significantly impact our revenues, results of operations, financial condition, business prospects and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nThe economic environment over the past few years has seen continued improvement in commercial real estate values which has generally increased payoffs and reduced the credit exposure in our loan portfolio. We have made, and continue to make, modifications and extensions to loans when it is economically feasible to do so. In some cases, a modification is a more viable alternative to foreclosure proceedings when a borrower cannot comply with loan terms. In doing so, lower borrower interest rates, combined with non-performing loans, would lower our net interest margins when comparing interest income to our costs of financing. If the markets were to deteriorate and another prolonged economic downturn was to occur, we believe there could be additional loan modifications and delinquencies, which may result in reduced net interest margins and additional losses throughout our sector.\nWe believe that improvement in commercial real estate values has also resulted in increased values of some of our real estate assets. Accordingly, as our real estate assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell, it is possible that we have substantial imbedded gains in certain of our real estate properties held for sale and investment that are not reflected in our financial statements or in the value of our stock.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of how we report our financial condition and results of operations because their application places the most significant demands on the judgment of our management.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses for the reporting periods. Such estimates relate principally to the determination of (1) the allowance for loan losses, (2) the valuation of real estate held for sale and investment (at acquisition and subsequently) and 3) the recoverability of deferred income tax assets.\nAllowance for Loan Losses, Impaired Loans and Non-accrual Status\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses on our investments in mortgage loans. A loan is impaired when it is probable that we may not collect all principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. As part of the detailed loan review, we consider many factors about the specific loan, including payment history, asset performance, borrower's financial capability and other characteristics. Management evaluates loans for non-accrual status each reporting period. A loan is placed on non-accrual status when the loan payment deficiencies exceed 90 days, or earlier if collection of principal and interest is substantially in doubt. When a loan is classified as nonaccrual, interest accruals discontinue and all past due interest remains accrued until the loan becomes current, is paid off or is foreclosed upon. Interest accruals are resumed on such loans only when they are brought fully current with respect to interest and principal and when, in the judgment of management, the loans are estimated to be fully collectible as to both principal and interest. Cash receipts on nonaccrual loans are used to reduce any outstanding accrued interest, and then are recorded as interest income, except when such payments are specifically designated as principal reduction or when management does not believe our investment in the loan is fully recoverable. When a loan is considered impaired, management estimates impairment based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell, generally through the use of appraisals. The determination of the general reserve for loans that are not considered impaired and are collectively evaluated for impairment is based on estimates made by management including consideration of historical losses by portfolio segment, internal asset classifications, and qualitative factors to include economic trends in our service areas, industry experience and trends, geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, our underwriting policies, the character of the loan portfolio, and probable incurred losses inherent in the portfolio taken as a whole. The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense. Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth but actual results may vary and there is no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be sufficient. Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance.\nReal Estate Held for Sale\nReal estate held for sale includes real estate acquired in full or partial settlement of loan obligations, generally through foreclosure, that is being marketed for sale. Real estate held for sale is recorded at acquisition at the property's estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell.\nClassification as Held for Sale-Real estate asset is classified as held for sale in the period when (i) management approves a plan to sell the asset, (ii) the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to usual and customary terms, (iii) a program is initiated to locate a buyer and actively market the asset for sale at a reasonable price, and (iv) completion of the sale is probable within one year. Real estate held for sale is stated at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less disposal cost, with any write-down to fair value less estimated costs to sell recorded as an impairment loss. For any subsequent increase in fair value less disposal cost, the impairment loss may be reversed, but only up to the amount of cumulative loss previously recognized. Depreciation is not recorded on assets classified as held for sale.\nIf circumstances arise that were previously considered unlikely and, as a result, we decide not to sell the real estate asset previously classified as held for sale, the real estate asset is reclassified as held for investment. Upon reclassification, the real estate asset is measured at the lower of (i) its carrying amount prior to classification as held for sale, adjusted for depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the real estate been continuously classified as held for investment, or (ii) its estimated fair value at the time we decide not to sell.\nReal Estate Sales-We evaluate if real estate sale transactions qualify for recognition under the full accrual method, considering whether, among other criteria, the buyer's initial and continuing investments are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay, any receivable due to the Company is not subject to future subordination, the Company has transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership and the Company does not have a substantial continuing involvement with the sold real estate. At the time the sale is consummated, a gain or loss is recognized as the difference between the sale price less disposal cost and the carrying value of the real estate.\nReal Estate Held for Investment\nReal estate held for investment includes real estate purchased or acquired in full or partial settlement of loan obligations, generally through foreclosure, that is not being marketed for sale and is either being operated, such as rental properties; is being managed through the development process, including obtaining appropriate and necessary entitlements and permits and construction; or are idle properties awaiting more favorable market conditions or properties we cannot sell without placing our REIT status at risk or become subject to prohibited transactions penalty tax. Real estate held for investment is recorded at acquisition at the property's estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. Depreciation of buildings and improvements is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated remaining useful lives of buildings and improvements. Depreciation of tenant improvements is provided on the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease terms. Costs related to the improvement of real estate held for sale and investment are capitalized, whereas those related to holding the property are expensed. We evaluate real estate held for investment periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We evaluate cash flows and determine impairments on an individual property basis. In making this determination, we often obtain new appraisals and/or review, among other things, current and future cash flows associated with each property, market information, market prices of similar properties recently sold or currently being offered for sale, and other quantitative and qualitative factors. If an impairment indicator exists, we evaluate whether the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the property, and if we determine that the carrying value is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell and the carrying amount of the property.\nIncome Taxes\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT. As a result of our REIT qualification and distribution policy, we do not generally expect to pay U.S. federal corporate level income taxes. Many of the REIT requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to net capital gains, to our stockholders. If we have previously qualified as a REIT and fail to qualify as a REIT in any subsequent taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed REIT taxable income.\nWe have elected (or may elect) to treat certain of our existing or newly created corporate subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries (each a \"TRS\"). In general, a TRS of a REIT may hold assets that the REIT cannot hold directly and, subject to certain exceptions related to hotels and healthcare properties, may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. A TRS is treated as a regular corporation and is subject to federal, state, local and foreign taxes on its income and property.\nDeferred Income Taxes - Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities, if any. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A deferred tax asset is also recognized for net operating loss carryforwards of TRS entities. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount that is \"more likely than not\" to be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's TRS entities generating sufficient taxable income in future periods or employing certain tax planning strategies to realize such deferred tax assets. The estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets more likely than not to be realized often requires significant judgment on the part of management because realization may be dependent on the outcome of property sales and/or other events that are difficult to forecast.\nTax Positions - The accounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is \"more likely than not\" that the position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. We have analyzed our various federal and state filing positions and believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions are well documented and supported. There was no reserve for uncertain tax positions recorded as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nSignificant Developments During 2016\nLoan Activity - We originated 23 new loans totaling $97,124,000 (when fully funded) with a weighted average interest rate of 7.67%. We received full or partial repayment on 29 loans in the total amount of $55,764,000 with a weighted average interest rate of 8.0%. We recorded a net increase in specific loan loss allowances on two impaired loans totaling $694,000 and recorded an increase in the general allowance for loan losses of $590,000, for a total of $1,285,000.\nReal Estate Property Sales - We sold seven real estate properties (three partially) for aggregate net sales proceeds of $90,997,000 (including note receivable of $1,595,000) and net gains totaling $24,498,000 ($20,782,000 after portion attributable to non-controlling interest). The sale of one property resulted in the repayment of notes payable totaling $32,881,000.\nReal Estate Construction Projects - We continued the construction of the retail/condominium project owned by ZRV and incurred approximately $24,175,000 in capitalized costs. This project is expected to be completed during the end of the first quarter or beginning of the second quarter of 2017.\nFinancing Activities - We amended the credit and related agreements (the \"CB&T Credit Facility\") with California Bank & Trust (\"CB&T\") and First Bank to increase the maximum potential borrowings from $30,000,000 up to $50,000,000 and to extend the maturity date for borrowings under the facility to March 1, 2018. The amendment also permits the maximum commitment of the lenders, including such additional lenders as may be added by the parties, to be increased up to $75,000,000 if requested by the Company and approved by the lenders. We also repaid all amounts owed under the Secured Revolving Credit Agreement Loan with Opus Bank (the \"Opus Credit Facility\") and the facility has terminated.\nSubsequent Events - The following events have occurred during the first quarter of 2017 and are discussed in further detail in our consolidated financial statements under \"Note 16 - Subsequent Events\" in Item 8 of this Annual Report:\n \u00b7 We sold the last parcel of unimproved land located in Gypsum, Colorado for net sales proceeds of $139,000 at no gain or loss. \n \u00b7 We sold the office condominium complex located in Oakdale, California for net sales proceeds of $732,000 at no gain or loss. \nComparison of Results of Operations for Years Ended 2016 and 2015\nThe following table sets forth our results of

31, 2016, as compared to $8,277,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income from performing loans as the average balance of performing loans increased between 2015 and 2016 by approximately 70%. This increase was partially offset by the fact that the 2015 period included approximately $1,723,000 of interest income collected on an impaired loan that did not recur during 2016.\nRental and other income from real estate properties decreased $4,814,000 (38% decrease) to $7,977,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $12,791,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the sale of four operating properties during 2015 and five during 2016.\nExpenses\nManagement fees increased $1,235,000 (60% increase) and servicing fees increased $112,000 (60% increase) during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, due to an increase in the average balance of loans in our portfolio of 60% during 2016, as compared to 2015.\nThe maximum management and servicing fees were paid to the Manager during years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The maximum management fee permitted under the Company's charter is 2.75% per year of the average unpaid balance of loans and, accordingly, management fees have (and will continue to) increase proportionately as we deploy capital into loans and increase our loan balances. For the years 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the management fees were 2.75%, 2.75%, 2.75%, 2.74% and 2.67% of the average unpaid balance of loans, respectively.\nIn determining whether to take the maximum management fees permitted, the Manager may consider a number of factors, including current market yields, delinquency experience, un-invested cash and real estate activities. During 2016 and 2015, the Manager chose to take the maximum compensation that it is able to take pursuant to the charter and will likely continue to take the maximum compensation for the foreseeable future.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $290,000 (23% increase) during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher legal, consulting, appraisal, director and audit fees during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nRental and other expenses on real estate properties decreased $1,464,000 (17% decrease) during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to the sale of four operating properties during 2015 and five during 2016. This decrease was offset by an increase in property tax expense and other holding costs on the TOTB North apartment building held within TOTB Miami that could no longer be capitalized to the basis of the project once construction was completed in March 2016 (and before it was sold in September 2016) and also due to an increase in marketing related expenses for the ZRV property currently under construction during 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $794,000 (39% decrease) during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to the discontinuation of depreciation on certain properties that were moved to Held for Sale during 2015 and 2016.\nInterest expense increased $921,000 (48% increase) during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015, due to a higher amount of interest incurred on our lines of credit as the balances were higher during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015, due to an additional $3,830,000 advance taken on the TSV loan with RaboBank (the \"TSV Loan\") during the third quarter of 2015 and due to the fact that interest incurred on the TOTB North construction loan could no longer be capitalized to the renovation project beginning in March 2016 as construction was completed (and before it was sold in September 2016).\nThe provision for loan losses of $1,285,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 was the result of an analysis performed on the loan portfolio. The general loan loss allowance increased $590,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in the balance of performing loans during the year, an increase in the historical loss percentage on commercial loans and an increase in land loans in the portfolio which loan segment has a higher loss factor than the other segments. The specific loan loss allowance also increased $694,000 (net) during the year ended December 31, 2016 due primarily to the recording of a specific loan loss allowance of $733,000 as of December 31, 2016 on one impaired loan as a result of an updated analysis of the collateral value completed based on actual sales of units during 2016.\nThe reversal of the provision for loan losses of $1,027,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 was the result of an analysis performed on the loan portfolio. The general loan loss allowance increased $877,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to an increase in the balance of performing loans during the year (net of payoffs). There was also an increase in the balance of both land and residential loans which have a higher historical loss factor for purposes of the general allowance calculation. The specific loan loss allowance decreased $1,904,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015, because new appraisals obtained during 2015 on two impaired loans reflected increased values of the underlying collateral, thus, resulting in a decrease in the specific allowance on these loans.\nThe impairment losses on real estate properties of $3,228,000 and $1,589,000, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were the result of updated appraisals or other valuation information obtained on certain of our real estate properties during those years.\nGain on Sales of Real Estate\nGain on sales of real estate (excluding gain attributable to a non-controlling interest in 2016) increased $2,679,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, as a result of the sale of seven real estate properties during 2016 (three partially), resulting in net gains totaling $24,498,000 (see further detail under \"Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests\" and \"Real Estate Properties Held for Sale and Investment\" below). The gain from the sale of one of these properties was offset by net income attributable to a non-controlling interest of approximately $3,716,000, as a portion of the gain on sale of the property held within TOTB Miami, LLC was attributable to the non-controlling interest. During 2015, we sold eight real estate properties, resulting in gains totaling $21,666,000 and recognized $153,000 of deferred gain under the installment method related to the sale of the condominiums located in Santa Barbara, California in 2012 due to the remaining repayment of the carry back loan during 2015.\nWe believe, from period to period in the near term, there will be fluctuations in net income resulting from the lag time between the sale of our real estate assets and deployment of the proceeds into new loan investments.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit increased $7,342,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, as a result of the transfer of two properties into ZRV and conversion of ZRV into a taxable REIT subsidiary during the second quarter of 2016, which now makes the income (loss) from these real estate assets taxable. Due to differences between the book and tax basis of these assets and net losses experienced to date, a deferred tax asset and related income tax benefit totaling $7,249,000 was recorded as of December 31, 2016. The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 differed from the statutory tax rate because the properties held within the ZRV TRS had differences between their respective book and tax basis and management now projects that the Company will realize the benefits from deferred tax assets related to these basis differences. The Company also has approximately $5,514,000 of net Federal tax losses to date that can be carried forward to offset taxable income in future years. As a result, a $7,249,000 deferred tax benefit was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 (as compared to income tax expense of $93,000 during 2015).\nNet Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests increased $904,000 (34% increase) during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to the sale of the condominium units and renovated apartment building owned by TOTB Miami, LLC during 2016 as a portion of the gain on sale of approximately $3,716,000 was attributable to our joint venture partner in TOTB Miami. During 2015, we sold the shopping center owned by 720 University and a portion of the gain on sale of approximately $2,479,000 was attributable to our joint venture partner in 720 University.\nComparison of Results of Operations for Years Ended 2015 and 2014\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 93:

increased $2,895,000 (54% increase) to $8,277,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $5,382,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to the accretion of the remaining $512,000 discount on an impaired loan as the loan was repaid prior to maturity in the first quarter of 2015, the collection of past due interest related to an impaired loan that we foreclosed on during 2014 of approximately $1,723,000 (as compared to $517,000 that was collected during 2014) and an increase in the average balance of performing loans between 2014 and 2015 of approximately $32,234,000 (96)%.\nRental and other income from real estate properties increased $523,000 (4% increase) to $12,791,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $12,268,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to rental income from a real estate property obtained via foreclosure in December 2014, increased rental rates and/or occupancy on certain of our properties during 2014 and 2015 and increased income from the TSV retail property that was completed and partially occupied during the fourth quarter of 2014, net of the reduction in rental income following the sale of four operating properties during 2015.\nExpenses\nManagement fees amounted to approximately $2,051,000 (19% increase) and $1,727,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Servicing fees amounted to approximately $186,000 (19% increase) and $157,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $382,000 (23% decrease) during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to lower legal, appraisal, consulting and insurance expenses during 2015 as compared to 2014.\nRental and other expenses on real estate properties increased $352,000 (4% increase) during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to expenses incurred on the assisted living facility located in Bensalem, Pennsylvania that was obtained via foreclosure in December 2014 and the completion of the retail complex owned by TSV during the fourth quarter of 2014, and, thus, there was a full year of operating expenses for these properties during 2015. A significant portion of the TSV expenses were charged to tenants as common area maintenance (\"CAM\") reimbursements and reflected in the increase in revenue for the property during the period. These increased expenses were partially offset by a decrease in expenses as a result of the sale of eight properties during 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $203,000 (9% decrease) during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to the sale of five depreciable properties during 2015.\nInterest expense increased $776,000 (67% increase) during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, due to interest incurred on our lines of credit, the loans payable within TOTB and TSV and the amortization of deferred financing costs to interest expense from these debt instruments during the year ended December 31, 2015. All of these debt facilities, other than the CB&T Credit Facility and the Opus Credit Facility, began to incur interest expense subsequent to the third quarter of 2014.\nThe reversal of the provision for loan losses of $1,027,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 was the result of an analysis performed on the loan portfolio. The general loan loss allowance increased $877,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to an increase in the balance of performing loans during the year (net of payoffs). There was also an increase in the balance of both land and residential loans which have a higher historical loss factor for purposes of the general allowance calculation. The specific loan loss allowance decreased $1,904,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015, because new appraisals obtained during 2015 on two impaired loans reflected increased values of the underlying collateral, thus, resulting in a decrease in the specific allowance on these loans.\nThe reversal of the provision for loan losses of $1,870,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014 was the result of an analysis performed on the loan portfolio. The general loan loss allowance decreased $634,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to an increase in performing commercial loans during 2014 and due to refinements in the loss and delinquency factors applied by management to performing loans reflecting the positive trends in the economy from increasing property values over the year. The specific loan loss allowance decreased $1,236,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily because a new appraisal obtained on a $7,535,000 impaired loan reflected an increase in the value of the underlying collateral during 2014, thus, resulting in a decrease in the specific allowance on this loan of $1,248,000.\nThe impairment losses on real estate properties of $1,589,000 and $179,000, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were the result of updated appraisals or other valuation information obtained on certain of our real estate properties during those years.\nGain on Sales of Real Estate\nGain on sales of real estate (excluding gain attributable to a non-controlling interest in 2015) increased $18,575,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2015 was a result of the sale of eight real estate properties during 2015, resulting in gains totaling $21,666,000 (see further detail under \"Real Estate Properties Held for Sale and Investment\" below). We also recognized $153,000 of deferred gain under the installment method related to the sale of the condominiums located in Santa Barbara, California in 2012 due to the remaining repayment of the carry back loan during the first quarter of 2015. The gain from the sale of one of these properties was offset by net income attributable to a non-controlling interest of approximately $2,479,000, as a portion of the gain on sale of the property held within 720 University, LLC was attributable to the non-controlling interest. During 2014, we sold two parcels of land and recognized deferred gains under the installment method in the total amount of $3,242,000.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests increased $2,502,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to the sale of the shopping center owned by 720 University during 2015 as a portion of the gain on sale of approximately $2,479,000 was attributable to our joint venture partner in 720 University.\nFinancial Condition\nDecember 31, 2016 and 2015\nLoan Portfolio\nOur portfolio of loan investments decreased from 56 as of December 31, 2015 to 55 as of December 31, 2016, and the average loan balance increased from $1,906,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $2,358,000 as of December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had two and three impaired loans, respectively, totaling approximately $4,884,000 (3.8% of the portfolio) and $8,694,000 (8.1%), respectively. This included matured loans totaling $4,656,000 and $8,452,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, seven loans of approximately $8,686,000 (6.7%) were past maturity but less than ninety days delinquent in monthly payments as of December 31, 2016 (combined total of $13,570,000 (10.5%) and $8,694,000 (8.1%), respectively, that are past maturity and impaired). Of the impaired and past maturity loans, none were in the process of foreclosure and none involved loans to borrowers who were in bankruptcy. We foreclosed on one loan during the year ended December 31, 2016 with a principal balance of approximately $1,079,000 and obtained the property via the trustee sale. We foreclosed on no loans during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOf the $8,694,000 in loans that were impaired as of December 31, 2015, $7,615,000 remained impaired in 2016 (balance of $4,884,000 as of December 31, 2016) and one loan with a principal balance of $1,079,000 was foreclosed upon during 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately $129,454,000 (99.8%) and $106,502,000 (99.8%) of our loans are interest only and/or require the borrower to make a \"balloon payment\" on the principal amount upon maturity of the loan. To the extent that a borrower has an obligation to pay loan principal in a large lump sum payment, its ability to satisfy this obligation may be dependent upon its ability to sell the property, obtain suitable refinancing or otherwise raise a substantial cash amount. As a result, these loans involve a higher risk of default than fully amortizing loans. Borrowers occasionally are not able to pay the full amount due at the maturity date. We may allow these borrowers to continue making the regularly scheduled monthly payments for certain periods of time to assist the borrower in meeting the balloon payment obligation without formally filing a notice of default. These loans for which the principal and any accrued interest is due and payable, but the borrower has failed to make such payment of principal and/or accrued interest are referred to as \"past maturity loans\". As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had eight and two past maturity loans totaling approximately $13,342,000 and $8,452,000, respectively.\nThere were no loans modified as troubled debt restructurings during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the terms of one impaired loan were modified as a troubled debt restructuring. The loan was rewritten as the borrower had previously paid the principal balance down partially from sale proceeds. The maturity date was extended by six months to April 2015. All other terms of the loan remained the same. The loan was repaid in full during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we held the following types of loan investments:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The Northern California region (which includes Monterey, Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Inyo counties and all counties north) is a large geographic area which has a diversified economic base. The ability of borrowers to repay loans is influenced by the economic strength of the region and the impact of prevailing market conditions on the value of real estate.\nOur investment in loans increased by $22,839,000 (21%) during the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of new loan originations during the year, net of loan payoffs and one loan foreclosure. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had twenty-two and twenty-four construction/rehabilitation loans in our portfolio with aggregate outstanding principal balances totaling $46,330,000 and $34,416,000, respectively.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses increased (decreased) by approximately $864,000, $(1,027,000) and $(1,870,000) (provsion, net of reversals and charge-offs) during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Manager believes that the allowance for loan losses is sufficient given the estimated underlying collateral values of impaired loans. There is no precise method used by the Manager to predict delinquency rates or losses on specific loans. The Manager has considered the number and amount of delinquent loans, loans subject to workout agreements and loans in bankruptcy in determining allowances for loan losses, but there can be no absolute assurance that the allowance is sufficient. Because any decision regarding the allowance for loan losses reflects judgment about the probability of future events, there is an inherent risk that such judgments will prove incorrect. In such event, actual losses may exceed (or be less than) the amount of any reserve. To the extent that we experience losses greater than the amount of its reserves, we may incur a charge to earnings that will adversely affect operating results and the amount of any dividends paid.\nChanges in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance, beginning of period\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,842,446\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,869,355\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,739,088\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for (reversal of) loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1,284,896\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,026,909\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (1,869,733\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Charge-offs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (447,520\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recoveries\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 27,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance, end of period\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,706,822\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,842,446\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,869,355\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, there was a general allowance for loan losses of $1,974,110 and $1,356,623, respectively, and a specific allowance for loan losses on one loan in the amount of $732,712 and $485,823, respectively.\nReal Estate Properties Held for Sale and Investment\nAs of December 31, 2016, we held title to twenty-two properties that were acquired through foreclosure, with a total carrying amount of approximately $113,123,000 (including properties held in five limited liability companies and three corporations), net of accumulated depreciation of $3,151,000. As of December 31, 2016, properties held for sale total $75,843,000 and properties held for investment total $37,280,000. We foreclosed on one loan during the year ended December 31, 2016 with a principal balance of approximately $1,079,000 and obtained the property via the trustee sale. We foreclosed on no loans during the year ended December 31, 2015. When we acquire property by foreclosure, we typically earn less income on those properties than could be earned on loans and we may not be able to sell the properties in a timely manner.\nChanges in real estate held for sale and investment during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance, beginning of period\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 153,838,412\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 163,016,805\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 135,315,964\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate acquired through foreclosure\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 700,800\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,572,406\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investments in real estate properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 29,061,735\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,274,125\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21,866,298\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred financing costs capitalized to construction project\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 119,471\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 207,347\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 120,952\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales of real estate properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (66,183,589\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (31,099,086\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (1,529,227\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment losses on real estate properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (3,227,807\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (1,589,434\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (179,040\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation of properties held for investment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (1,185,624\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (1,971,345\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (2,150,548\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance, end of period\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 113,123,398\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 153,838,412\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 163,016,805\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThirteen of our twenty-two properties do not currently generate revenue. Three of the Company's twenty-four commercial leases are set to expire during 2017. All of the Company's twelve residential leases are either on a month-to-month basis or will expire in 2017. The Company expects that new leases will be signed with existing or new tenants for the majority of these spaces and at rental rates that are at market and are at or above expiring rental amounts.\nFor purposes of assessing potential impairment of value during 2016, 2015 and 2014, we obtained updated appraisals or other valuation support on several of our real estate properties held for sale and investment, which resulted in additional impairment losses on three, one and one properties, respectively, in the aggregate amount of approximately $3,228,000, $1,589,000 and $179,000, respectively, recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\n2016 Sales Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold seven real estate properties (two partially) with details as follows:\n Net Sales Proceeds Gain (Loss) Light industrial building, Paso Robles, California $ 6,023,679 $ 4,557,979 Commercial building in building complex, Roseville, California 455,132 280,836 169 condominium units and 160 unit renovated and unoccupied apartment building, Miami, Florida (held within TOTB Miami, LLC)* 74,072,951 19,292,364 61 condominium units, Lakewood, Washington (held within Phillips Road, LLC) 5,030,384 846,998 2 improved, residential lots, Auburn, California (held within Zalanta Resort at the Village, LLC) 186,353 89,675 Medical office condominium complex, Gilbert, Arizona (held within Zalanta Resort at the Village, LLC) 3,793,870 (30,010 ) Unimproved, residential and commercial land, Gypsum, Colorado (three separate sales) 1,434,273 (540,079 ) $ 90,966,642 $ 24,497,763 * $32,881,000 of proceeds were used to pay off debt securing the properties and $7,934,000 was distributed to the non-controlling interest. \nIn September, 2016, TSV entered into a Purchase Agreement, as amended by Addendum 2, with Jianping Pan, Kawana Holdings LLC which has assigned its rights to Tahoe Chateau Land Holdings, LLC, a California limited liability company (the \"Buyer\"). Pursuant to the amended Purchase Agreement, TSV has agreed to sell to Buyer the approximately 8.0 acres of land and entitlements, including related parking and garage structures, owned by TSV in South Lake Tahoe, California, commonly known as The Chateau at the Village as further described in the Purchase Agreement (the \"Purchased Property\") for a total of $42.5 million, net of seller's credit which includes sales commissions (the \"Purchase Price\"). The property to be sold does not include the existing retail buildings and improvements (the \"Retained Property\").\nThe closing (the \"Closing\") of the transaction is subject to a number of conditions including, among others, a requirement that the responsible agency for the City of South Lake Tahoe, California approve a final subdivision map that is recorded establishing the Purchased Property and the Retained Property as separate legal parcels (the \"Final Subdivision Map\"). If the Final Subdivision Map is not recorded by March 31, 2017, the Closing date will be extended up to 60 days to allow TSV additional time to record the map. If, after such extension, the Final Subdivision Map is not recorded but all other closing conditions are satisfied, Addendum 2 provides that the Closing will be held with respect to the overall property, including the Purchased Property and the Retained Property, with the Retained Property to be conveyed back to TSV upon recording the Final Subdivision Map. There can be no assurance if or when the sale of the Purchased Property will be consummated.\nBuyer has paid $13,000,000 as a refundable deposit into escrow. Of this deposit, $3,000,000 has been released as a seller's credit out of escrow to pay certain Buyer expenses. The additional $32.5 million of Purchase Price is to be paid in cash at Closing.\nAs a result of the execution of the Purchase Agreement, the Company transferred approximately $6,066,000 of land basis from the first phase retail property (currently held for investment) to the second phase land being sold with this transaction. The basis of the property being sold is approximately $28,975,000 as of December 31, 2016.\n2015 Sales Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold eight real estate properties with details as follows:\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Net Sales Proceeds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Gain\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retail complex, Greeley, Colorado (held within 720 University, LLC)*\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,318,559\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,642,156\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 133 condominium units, Phoenix, Arizona (held within 54th Street Condos, LLC)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,930,112\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,077,122\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Industrial building, Sunnyvale, California (held within Wolfe Central, LLC)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,284,081\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,920,957\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Storage facility/business, Stockton, California**\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,479,080\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,695,248\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial buildings, Sacramento, California\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,153,713\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,262,745\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Undeveloped, residential land, Madera County, California\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,704,122\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 977,542\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retail buildings, San Jose, California\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,108,820\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 52,820\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marina, Oakley, California (held within The Last Resort and Marina, LLC)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 273,841\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 37,341\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,252,328\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,665,931\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> * $9,771,000 of proceeds were used to pay off debt securing the property and $2,479,000 was distributed to the non-controlling interest.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ** Including carryback note receivable of $4,650,000.\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the above table, we recognized gain of approximately $153,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 that had previously been deferred related to the sale of a real estate property in 2012.

The gains on the sales of these properties were being accounted for under the installment method.\n2016 Foreclosure Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company foreclosed on one loan secured by an office property located in Oakdale, California with a principal balance of approximately $1,079,000 and obtained the property via the trustee's sale. In addition, accrued interest and advances made on the loan (for items such as legal fees and delinquent property taxes) in the total amount of approximately $70,000 were capitalized to the basis of the property. A specific loan allowance has been previously established on this loan of approximately $495,000. This amount was then recorded as a charge-off against the allowance for loan losses at the time of foreclosure, after a reduction of the previously established allowance in the amount of approximately $47,000 as a result of an updated appraisal obtained (net charge-off of $448,000). The property, along with a unit in the building purchased by the Company in 2015, was contributed into a new taxable REIT subsidiary, East G, LLC, in June 2016. The property is classified as held for sale as a sale is expected to be completed within a one year period.\n2015 Foreclosure Activity\nThe Company foreclosed on no loans during the year ended December 31, 2015.\n2014 Foreclosure Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, Sandmound Marina, LLC (\"Sandmound\") (wholly owned by the Company) foreclosed on a first mortgage loan secured by unimproved land and a marina and campground located in Bethel Island, California with a principal balance of approximately $2,960,000 and obtained the properties via the trustee's sale.In addition, advances made on the loan or incurred as part of the foreclosure in the total amount of approximately $282,000 were capitalized to the basis of the properties. The fair market values of the properties acquired were estimated to be higher than Sandmound's recorded investment in the subject loan, and, thus, a gain on foreclosure in the amount of approximately $257,000 was recorded.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company foreclosed on a first mortgage loan secured by two adjacent, vacant buildings located in San Jose, California with a principal balance of approximately $690,000 and obtained the properties via the trustee's sale.In addition, accrued interest and advances made on the loan or incurred as part of the foreclosure in the total amount of approximately $158,000 were capitalized to the basis of the properties. The fair market values of the properties acquired were estimated to be higher than the Company's recorded investment in the subject loan, and, thus, a gain on foreclosure in the amount of approximately $208,000 was recorded.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company foreclosed on a second mortgage loan secured by an assisted living facility located in Bensalem, Pennsylvania with a principal balance of approximately $3,420,000 and obtained the property via the trustee's sale.In addition, advances made on the loan or incurred as part of the foreclosure in the total amount of approximately $519,000 were capitalized to the basis of the property. In 2012, the Company had purchased the first mortgage loan on this property which it became subject to at the time of foreclosure. Thus, the Company's investment in this loan of approximately $1,079,000 was added to the basis of the property. The fair market value of the property acquired was estimated to approximate the Company's recorded investments in the subject loans.\nMajority-Owned Limited Liability Companies\n720 University, LLC\nWe had an investment in a limited liability company, 720 University, LLC (720 University), which owned a commercial retail property located in Greeley, Colorado. We received 65% of the profits and losses in 720 University after priority return on partner contributions was allocated at the rate of 10% per annum. The assets, liabilities, income and expenses of 720 University were consolidated into the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company.\nIn November 2014, 720 University entered into a Real Estate Sale Agreement pursuant to which 720 University agreed to sell the property for $20,750,000. On January 30, 2015, an initial closing was held for the purpose of refinancing the existing 720 University note payable, and the buyer extended a new loan to 720 University to repay the existing note payable to the bank. The principal amount of the new loan was $9,771,263 and accrued interest at 6.0% per annum until paid off upon the closing of the sale of the property to the buyer. The sale closed in June 2015 resulting in gain on sale of approximately $8,642,000 ($6,163,000 to the Company after the gain attributable to the non-controlling interest or approximately $2,479,000).\nThe net income to the Company from 720 University was approximately $6,437,000 and $355,000 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The non-controlling interest of the joint venture partner of approximately $5,000 as of December 31, 2015 is reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 720 University was dissolved in December 2015.\nTOTB Miami, LLC\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company and two co-lenders (which included OFG and PRC Treasures, LLC, or PRC) foreclosed on a participated, first mortgage loan secured by a condominium complex located in Miami, Florida with a principal balance to the Company of approximately $26,257,000 and obtained an undivided interest in the properties via the trustee's sale. The Company and the other lenders formed a Florida limited liability company, TOTB Miami, to own and operate the complex. The complex consisted of three buildings, two of which were renovated and being leased, and in which 169 units remained unsold and one which has been contributed to a wholly-owned subsidiary of TOTB, TOTB North, and contained 160 vacant units that were recently renovated.\nIn March 2012, we made a priority capital contribution to TOTB in the amount of $7,200,000. TOTB then purchased PRC's member interest in TOTB for $7,200,000. Thus, the remaining members in TOTB are now the Company and OFG. On the same date, the Company and OFG executed an amendment to the TOTB operating agreement to set the percentage of capital held by each at 80.74% for the Company and 19.26% for OFG based on the dollar amount of capital invested in TOTB. Income and loss allocations were made based on these percentages.\nDuring 2014, TOTB contributed the vacant and unimproved 160 unit apartment building to a new wholly-owned entity, TOTB North. TOTB North then entered into a construction loan agreement which provided up to $21,304,000 for the purpose of renovating and improving the apartment building. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the balance on the construction loan was approximately $0 and $16,010,000, respectively. The construction project was substantially completed in March 2016. The loan was repaid in full with the closing of the sale of the TOTB property in September 2016 (see below).\nDuring 2014, TOTB entered into a loan agreement whereby it borrowed $13,000,000 secured by the 154 renovated and leased condominium units in the Pointe building. The outstanding balance as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $0 and $12,693,000, respectively. The loan bore interest at the floating daily three month LIBOR rate of interest plus 4.0% per annum, but in no event lower than 4.25%. Principal and interest was payable monthly with principal amortizing over 300 months. The loan was repaid in full with the closing of the sale of the TOTB property in September 2016 (see below).\nAll of the TOTB and TOTB North properties were sold in September 2016 for net sales proceeds of approximately $74,073,000, resulting in gain of approximately $19,292,000 ($15,577,000 to the Company after the gain attributable to the non-controlling interest of approximately $3,716,000).\nThe non-controlling interest of OFG totaled approximately $0 and $4,524,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The net income to the Company from TOTB was approximately $14,977,000, $311,000 and $573,000 during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nEquity Method Investment in Limited Liability Company\n1850 De La Cruz, LLC\nDuring 2008, we entered into an Operating Agreement of 1850 De La Cruz LLC, a California limited liability company (\"1850\"), with Nanook Ventures LLC (\"Nanook\"), an unrelated party. The purpose of the joint venture is to acquire, own and operate certain industrial land and buildings located in Santa Clara, California that were owned by the Company. At the time of closing in July 2008, the two properties were separately contributed to two new limited liability companies, Nanook Ventures One LLC and Nanook Ventures Two LLC that are wholly owned by 1850. The Company and Nanook are the Members of 1850 and NV Manager, LLC is the manager.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we received capital distributions from 1850 in the total amount of $180,000, $177,000 and $170,000, respectively. The net income to the Company from its investment in 1850 De La Cruz was approximately $179,000, $175,000 and $170,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased from approximately $8,481,000 as of December 31, 2015 to approximately $6,934,000 as of December 31, 2016 ($1,547,000 or 18% decrease) due primarily to cash used totaling $137,626,000 for investment in loans and real estate properties, net repayment of debt and dividends paid, which was offset by cash received totaling $137,107,000 from the sale of real estate properties (net of distributions to non-controlling interest) and principal collected on loans. In addition, the Company used $943,000 in cash for operating activities during 2016.\nInterest and Other Receivables\nInterest and other receivables increased from approximately $1,765,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $2,164,000 as of December 31, 2016 ($399,000 or 23% increase) due primarily to an additional unsecured loan of $250,000 made to our tenant in the assisted care facility located in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. The tenant is in the process of transitioning the facility and business to memory care in order to increase occupancy and income on the property and needed funds to continue to operate during this transition. The remaining increase was due primarily to growth in the loan portfolio during the year.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nDeferred financing costs accounted for as assets increased from approximately $126,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $172,000 as of December 31, 2016 ($46,000 or 36% increase) due primarily to a new origination fee and other loan costs paid on the amended CB&T Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2016, net of amortization of such costs.\nDeferred Tax Assets, Net\nDeferred tax assets increased from $0 as of December 31, 2015 to approximately $7,249,000 as of December 31, 2016 due to the transfer of two properties into ZRV and the conversion of ZRV into a TRS during the second quarter of 2016, which now makes the income (loss) from these real estate assets taxable. Due to temporary differences between the book and tax basis of these assets and net operating losses to date, a deferred tax asset and related income tax benefit totaling approximately $7,249,000 was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDividends Payable\nDividends payable decreased from approximately $2,133,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $1,402,000 as of\nDecember 31, 2016 ($731,000 or 34% decrease) primarily due to a decrease in Federal income taxes paid on undistributed capital gains on behalf of shareholders. In January 2016 a tax payment in the amount $1,314,000 was made (for 2015 undistributed capital gains), whereas in January 2017 a tax payment in the amount of $583,000 was made (for 2016 undistributed capital gains).\nAccounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities increased from approximately $3,359,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $3,700,000 as of December 31, 2016 ($341,000 or 10% increase), due primarily to increased payables related to the construction activities on the property owned by ZRV.\nLines of Credit Payable\nLines of credit payable decreased from $20,916,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $4,976,000 as of December 31 2016 ($15,940,000 or 76% decrease) due primarily to repayments on the lines of credit as a result of net proceeds received on the sales of real estate properties, net of new loan investments during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNotes and Loans Payable on Real Estate\nNotes and loans payable decreased from approximately $45,459,000 as of December 31, 2015 to approximately $33,386,000 as of December 31, 2016 ($12,073,000 or 27% decrease) due primarily to the repayment in full of the TOTB Miami and TOTB North loans totaling approximately $32,881,000 as a result of the sale of the related properties during the year ended December 31, 2016, repayment of two notes payable secured by TSV and ZRV real estate totaling $3,400,000, net of an increase in debt of approximately $19,897,000 from the new ZRV construction loan obtained during the year.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests decreased from approximately $4,529,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $0 as of December 31, 2016 ($4,529,000 or 100% decrease), due to the sale of the properties owned by TOTB Miami and the distribution of net proceeds to the non-controlling interest during the year ended December 31, 2016. The TOTB Miami LLC was dissolved in December 2016.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFunds from Operations\nWe utilize supplemental non-GAAP measures of operating performance, including funds from operations (\"FFO\"), an industry-wide standard measure of REIT operating performance, and adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\"). We believe FFO and AFFO provide investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We determine FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"), as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding real estate-related depreciation and amortization, impairment losses on depreciable real estate, gains or losses on the sales of depreciable real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated ventures.\nWe calculate AFFO by adding or subtracting from FFO the impact of non-cash accounting items, as well as gains/losses on sales of other real estate. We adjust for these items to analyze our ability to produce cash flow from on-going operations, which we use to pay dividends to our shareholders. Non-cash adjustments to FFO include the following: provisions for (reversals of) loan losses; amortization of deferred financing costs; depreciation of other assets; impairment of other real estate; accretion of loan discount; gain on foreclosure of loans; straight-line rental adjustments and deferred income tax benefit.\nOur calculations of FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other REITs. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income as a measure of our operating performance or to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity, nor are they indicative of cash flows from operating and financial activities.\nWe urge investors to carefully review the GAAP financial information included as part of the Annual Report, as well as in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and quarterly earnings releases.\nThe following table reconciles FFO and AFFO to comparable GAAP financial measures:\nTable 103: <table> <tr>

experienced and that the amount of such losses will vary from time to time, depending on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as affected by economic conditions and the financial experiences of borrowers. Many of these factors are beyond the control of the Company or its management. There is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on specific loans or on segments of the loan portfolio.\nThe conclusion that a Company loan may become uncollectible, in whole or in part, is a matter of judgment. Although supervised lenders are subject to regulations that, among other things, require them to perform ongoing analyses of their loan portfolios (including analyses of loan-to-value ratios, reserves, etc.), and to obtain current information regarding their borrowers and the securing properties, we are not subject to these regulations and have not adopted these practices. Rather, management, in connection with the quarterly closing of our accounting records and the preparation of the financial statements, evaluates our loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on management's evaluation of the risk inherent in our loan portfolio and current economic conditions. Such evaluation, which includes a review of all loans on which management determines that full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers among other matters:\n \u00b7 prevailing economic conditions; \n \u00b7 our historical loss experience; \n \u00b7 the types and dollar amounts of loans in the portfolio; \n \u00b7 borrowers' financial condition and adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to pay; \n \u00b7 evaluation of industry trends; \n \u00b7 review and evaluation of loans identified as having loss potential; and \n \u00b7 estimated net realizable value or fair value of the underlying collateral. \nBased upon this evaluation, a determination is made as to whether the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable incurred credit losses in the Company's loan portfolio. Additions to the allowance for loan losses are made by charges to the provision for loan losses. Loan losses deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses. As of December 31, 2016, management believes that the allowance for loan losses of approximately $2,707,000 is adequate in amount to cover probable incurred credit losses. Because of the number of variables involved, the magnitude of the swings possible and management's inability to control many of these factors, actual results may and do sometimes differ significantly from estimates made by management. As of December 31, 2016, two loans totaling approximately $4,884,000 were impaired. One of these loans of approximately $4,656,000 was past maturity as of December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a net increase in the allowance for loan losses of approximately $864,000 (increase in the specific allowance of $694,000, increase in the general allowance of approximately $591,000, recovery of $27,000, net of charge-off of approximately $448,000). Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is sufficient given the estimated fair value of the collateral underlying impaired and past maturity loans and based on historical loss and delinquency factors applied to performing loans by class.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions to our stockholders and other general business needs.\nWe believe our available cash and restricted cash balances, other financing arrangements, and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months.\nWe require liquidity to:\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> fund future loan investments;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> to develop, improve and maintain real estate properties;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> to repay principal and interest on our borrowings;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> to pay our expenses, including compensation to our Manager;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> to pay U.S. federal, state, and local taxes of our TRSs;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> to distribute annually a minimum of 90% of our REIT taxable income and to make investments in a manner that enables us to maintain our qualification as a REIT; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> to make tax payments associated with undistributed capital gains.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe intend to meet these liquidity requirements primarily through the following:\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> the use of our cash and cash equivalent balances of $434,000 as of December 31, 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> cash generated from operating activities, including interest income from our loan portfolio and income generated from our real estate properties;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> proceeds from the sales of real estate properties;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> proceeds from our line of credit;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> proceeds from future borrowings including additional lines of credit;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> proceeds from the construction loan obtained by ZRV for construction of a new mixed-use retail and residential building; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> proceeds from potential future offerings of our equity securities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented:\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (943,292\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,880,684\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,967,167\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 41,447,991\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (9,376,732\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (38,875,451\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (41,326,298\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 3,338,345\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 29,163,095\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately $822,000 and $158,000, respectively. The decrease during 2016 was primarily due to more cash used for investments in loans and real estate properties and net repayment of debt as compared to cash received from the sales of real estate properties and principal payments on loans during the year. The decrease during 2015 was primarily due to investments in new loans and capitalized costs related to construction on the second phase retail/residential portion of the land now owned by Zalanta, net of proceeds from the sales of eight real estate properties during the year.\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities are primarily rental and other income from real estate properties, net of real estate expenses, and interest received from our investments in loans, partially offset by payment of operating expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, cash flows from operating activities decreased $6,824,000 and increased $2,914,000, respectively, as compared to the previous year. The decrease during 2016 reflects decreased cash flow from rental properties as a result of the sale of four operating properties during 2015 and five during 2016 and higher management and service fees, general and administrative expenses and interest expense during 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase during 2015 was due to increased cash flow from rental properties as a result of increased occupancy and rental rates, completion and leasing of the TSV retail complex during the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased interest income on performing loans and collected on impaired loans during 2015.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the periods presented reflect our investing activity. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, cash flows from investing activities increased $50,825,000 and $29,499,000, respectively, as compared to the previous year. Approximately $41,448,000 was provided by investing activities during 2016 as $145,977,000 was received from the sales of real estate properties, the payoff of loans and transfer from restricted cash, which was partially offset by an aggregate of $104,679,000 that was used for investment in loans and improvements to real estate properties during the year. Approximately $9,377,000 was used in investing activities during 2015 as an aggregate of $93,324,000 was used for investment in loans, improvements to real estate properties and transfer to restricted cash, which was partially offset by net proceeds from the sales of real estate properties and the payoff of loans totaling $83,818,000 during the period.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities during 2016 totaled approximately $41,326,000 and consisted primarily of $28,354,000 of net repayments on our lines of credit and notes payable, $8,144,000 of distributions to non-controlling interests and $4,593,000 of dividends paid to stockholders. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2015 of approximately $3,338,000 reflects net advances on CB&T and Opus Credit Facilities of $9,466,000, $28,603,000 in additional borrowings on notes and loans payable and a $279,000 contribution from non-controlling interest, net of dividends paid to stockholders of approximately $4,817,000, distribution of non-controlling interest of $2,592,000, purchase of treasury stock pursuant to the 2015 Repurchase Plan of $7,503,000, payment of deferred financing costs of $42,000 and repayments of notes payable of $20,056,000.\nDividends\nWe intend to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our Common Stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT annually distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its REIT taxable income, including capital gains, in any taxable year, that it pay tax at regular corporate rates on that undistributed portion. We intend to make regular quarterly distributions to our stockholders in an amount equal to or greater than our REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains, if and to the extent authorized by our Board of Directors. Before we make any distributions, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our REIT taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured investment vehicles, special purpose entities or VIEs, established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intend to provide additional funding to any such entities.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe table below summarizes our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 and in future periods in which we expect to settle such obligations. The table does not reflect the effect of actual repayments or draws on the obligations or any new financing obtained subsequent to year end.\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

(3) Variable-rate indebtedness assumes a prime rate of 3.75% (actual rate at December 31, 2016) through the original maturity date of the financing. Interest payable is based on balances outstanding as of December 31, 2016. (4) Amounts represent the commitments we have made to fund borrowers in our existing lending arrangements as of December 31, 2016. \nThe table above does not reflect amounts due to the Manager pursuant to our charter, as described below, as the charter does not provide for a fixed and determinable payment.\nManagement Agreement and Charter\nThe Manager provides services to the Company pursuant to the Management Agreement with the Manager dated May 20, 2013, and is entitled to receive a management fee, servicing fee, late fees, other miscellaneous fees, and the reimbursement of certain expenses as described in the Company's charter. In consideration of the management services rendered to the Company, OFG is entitled to receive from the Company a management fee payable monthly, subject to a maximum of 2.75% per annum of the average unpaid balance of the mortgage loans at the end of each month in the calendar year. In addition, OFG in is also entitled to a monthly loan servicing fee, which, when added to all other fees paid in connection with the servicing of a particular loan, does not exceed the lesser of the customary, competitive fee paid in the community where the loan is placed for the provision of such services on that type of loan, or up to 0.25% per annum of the unpaid principle balance of the loans. Pursuant to the charter, OFG also receives all late payment charges from borrowers on loans owned by the Company, as well as, other miscellaneous fees which are collected from loan payments, loan payoffs or advances from loan principal, payable in cash on a monthly basis following the end of each month.\nIn addition, OFG is reimbursed by the Company for the actual cost of goods, services and materials used for or by the Company and paid by OFG and the salary and related salary expense of OFG's non-management and non-supervisory personnel performing services for the Company which could be performed by independent parties, including tax, accounting, and legal expenses (subject to certain limitations in the Management Agreement). Expense reimbursements to OFG are made in cash on a monthly basis following the end of each month. The Company's reimbursement obligation is not subject to any dollar limitation.\nThe Management Agreement and the terms of the charter compensation and expense reimbursement shall remain in effect for the duration of the existence of the Company, unless earlier terminated by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, automatically, or by OFG, or by the Company in accordance with the Agreement.\nCompany Debt\nThe terms of the Company debt are discussed in further detail in our consolidated financial statements under \"Note 7 - Lines of Credit Payable\" and \"Note 8 - Notes and Loans Payable on Real Estate\" in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nCB&T Line of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company has one credit facility. The total amount available to borrow under the CB&T Credit Facility was $22,625,000 and the balance outstanding was $4,976,000 (leaving $17,649,000 available). As of March 10, 2017, the total amount available to borrow under the CB&T Credit Facility is $41,182,000 and the balance outstanding is $13,314,000 (leaving $27,868,000 available). Interest on borrowings under the CB&T Credit Facility are payable monthly and, as a result of the amendment to the facility entered into in March 2016 to expand the line of credit and extend its maturity, all amounts outstanding under the facility are to be repaid not later than March 1, 2018 and advances may be made up to that date.\nTahoe Stateline Venture, LLC Loan Payable\nThe balance of the TSV Loan was approximately $13,635,000 as of December 31, 2016 and $13,538,000 as of March 10, 2017. TSV borrowed $10,445,000 at the first closing under the TSV Loan and an additional $3,830,000 in September 2015. TSV makes monthly payments of principal and accrued interest and the balance of the loan is due on the maturity date, which is January 1, 2021.\nZRV Construction Loan\nThe construction loan among ZRV and ZRV II as the Borrowers and Western Alliance Bank as the lender (the \"ZRV Loan\") will provide the Borrowers up to $31,000,000, subject to the terms and conditions of the loan, for the purposes of financing the construction of a new mixed-use retail and residential building (the \"Project\") in South Lake Tahoe, California. The balance of the ZRV Loan was approximately $20,214,000 as of December 31, 2016 and approximately $23,408,000 as of March 10, 2017. Monthly interest only payments are required from an established interest reserve. In addition, on the last day of the calendar quarter in which a Certificate of Occupancy is obtained with respect to completion of the first condominium in the Project, and, continuing on the last day of each calendar quarter thereafter during the term of the Loan, $6 million of principal is required to be repaid. The balance of the ZRV Loan is due on August 3, 2018.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have commitments to advance additional funds to borrowers of construction, rehabilitation and other loans (including interest reserves) in the total amount of approximately $31,490,000.\nWe have entered into various contracts for design, architectural, engineering, foundation work and construction for the development of the land owned by ZRV. The aggregate amount of these contracts as of the date of this filing is approximately $33,809,000 of which approximately $26,013,000 has been incurred as of December 31, 2016 in addition to other capitalized costs related to the construction project of $3,801,000 (total of $29,814,000). We expect that all costs for this project will be paid from the construction loan or cash reserves. It is possible that additional change orders will be submitted and construction costs may be higher than expected.\nWe have entered into various contracts for design, architectural and engineering for the development of the land owned by ZRV II. The aggregate amount of these contracts totaled approximately $1,021,000 of which approximately $845,000 had been incurred as of December 31, 2016 in addition to other capitalized costs related to the project of $265,000 (total of $1,110,000). We expect that all costs for this phase of the project will be paid from cash reserves and/or advances from the CB&T Credit Facility. It is possible that additional change orders will be submitted and costs may be higher than expected.\nContingency Reserves\nWe are required to maintain cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as contingency reserves in an aggregate amount of at least 1.50% of Capital (as defined in our charter). Although the Manager believes the contingency reserves are adequate, it could become necessary for us to sell or otherwise liquidate certain of our investments or other assets to cover such contingencies on terms which might not be favorable to the Company. The contingency reserves held in restricted cash were approximately $3,738,000 and $3,809,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.", "item_7_text": "Item 7.

All forward-looking statements and reasons why results may differ included in this Form 10-K are made as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statement or reason why actual results may differ.\nOverview and Background\nWe are a specialty finance company that focuses on the origination, investment and management of commercial real estate loans primarily in the Western U.S. We provide customized, short-term capital to small and middle-market investors and developers who require speed and flexibility. We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are externally managed and advised by OFG, a specialized commercial real estate management company that has originated, serviced and managed alternative commercial real estate investments since 1951.\nThe Company is a Maryland corporation formed to reorganize the business of its predecessor, OMIF, into a publicly traded REIT. Beginning in 2009, OMIF experienced liquidity issues as its borrowers were unable to access credit sources to pay off its loans. OMIF eventually foreclosed on a substantial portion of its loan portfolio, repositioning many of the properties for investment or eventual sale. OMIF also experienced a significant increase in capital withdrawal requests that it was unable to honor due to insufficient cash, net of reserves, and restrictions under the terms of its bank line of credit. In addition, OMIF was restricted by provisions within the partnership agreement from making additional investments in loans while qualified redemption requests remained pending and unpaid. In addition to increasing investor liquidity through public listing of its stock, the Company was created to provide the opportunity for resuming mortgage lending activities, with the goal of increasing income to stockholders.\nOn May 20, 2013, OMIF merged with and into the Company with the Company as the surviving corporation, succeeding to and continuing the business and operations of OMIF. The Company now, by virtue of the Merger, directly or indirectly owns all of the assets and business formerly owned by OMIF. The Company is a deemed successor issuer to OMIF pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act, and on July 1, 2013, the Company's Common Stock was listed on the NYSE MKT exchange. For accounting purposes, the Merger has been treated as a transfer of assets and exchange of shares between entities under common control. The accounting basis used to initially record the assets and liabilities in the Company is the carryover basis of OMIF. OMIF was a California Limited Partnership registered with the SEC that was formed in 1983 for the purposes of funding and servicing short-term commercial real estate loans.\nOur primary sources of revenue are interest income earned on our loan investment portfolio and revenues we generate from our operating real estate assets. We have resumed originating loans and believe the Company is well positioned to capitalize on lending opportunities as the economy continues to recover. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to identify and make loans to suitable commercial real estate borrowers or have adequate capital and liquidity to fund such loans.\nOur operating results are affected primarily by:\n \u00b7 the level of foreclosures and related loan and real estate losses experienced; \n \u00b7 the income or losses from foreclosed properties prior to the time of disposal, and our ability to dispose of those properties in a timely manner; \n \u00b7 the amount of cash available to invest in loans; \n \u00b7 the amount of borrowing to finance loan investments and our cost of funds on such borrowing; \n \u00b7 the level of real estate lending activity in the markets serviced; \n \u00b7 the ability to identify and lend to suitable borrowers; \n \u00b7 the interest rates we are able to charge on loans; and \n \u00b7 the level of delinquencies on loans. \nBetween 2008 and 2013, we experienced increased delinquent loans and foreclosures which created substantial losses. As a result, we also owned significantly more real estate than in the past, which has reduced cash flow and net income. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 4% of our loans were impaired and/or past maturity, down from 8% as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we owned approximately $113 million of real estate held for sale or investment, which is approximately 44% of total assets, a decrease of $40.7 million or 15% of total assets as compared to December 31, 2015. During 2016, we sold seven real estate properties (three partial) for aggregate net sales proceeds of $90,997,000 (including note receivable of $1,595,000) and net gains totaling $24,498,000 ($20,782,000 to the Company after $3,716,000 gain attributable to non-controlling interest). We will continue to attempt to sell certain of our properties but may need to sell them for losses or wait until market values fully recover. In addition, under the REIT tax rules, we may be subject to a \"prohibited transaction\" penalty tax on tax gains from the sale of our properties in certain circumstances. In addition, we are also limited in the number and dollar amount of properties we can sell in a given year under the REIT tax rules.\nAlthough currently management believes that only one of our delinquent loans will result in loss to the Company (and has caused the Company to record a specific allowance for loan losses on such loan), real estate values could decrease further. Management continues to perform frequent evaluations of collateral values for our loans using internal and external sources, including the use of updated independent appraisals. As a result of these evaluations, the allowance for loan losses and our investments in real estate could increase or decrease in the near term, and such changes could be material.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur primary business objective is to provide our stockholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns by producing consistent and predictable dividends while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We believe we have positioned the Company for future growth and seek to increase funds from operations, or FFO, and distributions to stockholders through active portfolio management and execution of our business plan which is outlined below:\n \u00b7 Capitalize on market lending opportunity by leveraging existing origination network to expand our commercial real estate loan portfolio. \n \u00b7 Enhance and reposition our commercial real estate assets through the investment of capital and strategic management. \n \u00b7 Increase liquidity available for lending activities by focusing on opportunities to remove real estate assets from our balance sheet. \n \u00b7 Manage leverage to marginally expand sources of liquidity while maintaining a conservative balance sheet. \nCurrent Market Conditions, Risks and Recent Trends\nOur ability to execute our business strategy, particularly the growth of our loan portfolio, is dependent on many factors, including our ability to sell our real estate assets in a timely manner and access financing on favorable terms. The previous economic downturn had a significant negative impact on both us and our borrowers. If similar economic conditions recur in the future, it may limit our options to sell our real estate assets, obtaining financing on favorable terms or otherwise obtain necessary capital to make new loans, and may also adversely impact the creditworthiness of our borrowers which could result in their inability to repay their loans.\nThe commercial real estate markets continue to improve, but uncertainty remains as a result of global market instability, the current political climate and other matters and their potential impact on the U.S. economy and commercial real estate markets. In addition, the growth in multifamily rental rates seen over the past few years are showing signs of stabilizing. If real estate values decline again and/or rent growth subsides, it may limit our new loan originations since borrowers often use increases in the value of, and revenues produced from, their existing properties to support the purchase or investment in additional properties. Declining real estate values may also significantly increase the likelihood that we will have difficulty selling our existing real estate assets in a timely manner, and that we will incur losses on our loans in the event of default because the value of our collateral may be insufficient to cover our investment in the loan. Any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could adversely affect both our interest income from loans as well as our ability to originate loans, which would significantly impact our revenues, results of operations, financial condition, business prospects and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nThe economic environment over the past few years has seen continued improvement in commercial real estate values which has generally increased payoffs and reduced the credit exposure in our loan portfolio. We have made, and continue to make, modifications and extensions to loans when it is economically feasible to do so. In some cases, a modification is a more viable alternative to foreclosure proceedings when a borrower cannot comply with loan terms. In doing so, lower borrower interest rates, combined with non-performing loans, would lower our net interest margins when comparing interest income to our costs of financing. If the markets were to deteriorate and another prolonged economic downturn was to occur, we believe there could be additional loan modifications and delinquencies, which may result in reduced net interest margins and additional losses throughout our sector.\nWe believe that improvement in commercial real estate values has also resulted in increased values of some of our real estate assets. Accordingly, as our real estate assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell, it is possible that we have substantial imbedded gains in certain of our real estate properties held for sale and investment that are not reflected in our financial statements or in the value of our stock.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of how we report our financial condition and results of operations because their application places the most significant demands on the judgment of our management.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses for the reporting periods. Such estimates relate principally to the determination of (1) the allowance for loan losses, (2) the valuation of real estate held for sale and investment (at acquisition and subsequently) and 3) the recoverability of deferred income tax assets.\nAllowance for Loan Losses, Impaired Loans and Non-accrual Status\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses on our investments in mortgage loans. A loan is impaired when it is probable that we may not collect all principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. As part of the detailed loan review, we consider many factors about the specific loan, including payment history, asset performance, borrower's financial capability and other characteristics. Management evaluates loans for non-accrual status each reporting period. A loan is placed on non-accrual status when the loan payment deficiencies exceed 90 days, or earlier if collection of principal and interest is substantially in doubt. When a loan is classified as nonaccrual, interest accruals discontinue and all past due interest remains accrued until the loan becomes current, is paid off or is foreclosed upon. Interest accruals are resumed on such loans only when they are brought fully current with respect to interest and principal and when, in the judgment of management, the loans are estimated to be fully collectible as to both principal and interest. Cash receipts on nonaccrual loans are used to reduce any outstanding accrued interest, and then are recorded as interest income, except when such payments are specifically designated as principal reduction or when management does not believe our investment in the loan is fully recoverable. When a loan is considered impaired, management estimates impairment based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell, generally through the use of appraisals. The determination of the general reserve for loans that are not considered impaired and are collectively evaluated for impairment is based on estimates made by management including consideration of historical losses by portfolio segment, internal asset classifications, and qualitative factors to include economic trends in our service areas, industry experience and trends, geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, our underwriting policies, the character of the loan portfolio, and probable incurred losses inherent in the portfolio taken as a whole. The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense. Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth but actual results may vary and there is no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be sufficient. Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance.\nReal Estate Held for Sale\nReal estate held for sale includes real estate acquired in full or partial settlement of loan obligations, generally through foreclosure, that is being marketed for sale. Real estate held for sale is recorded at acquisition at the property's estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell.\nClassification as Held for Sale-Real estate asset is classified as held for sale in the period when (i) management approves a plan to sell the asset, (ii) the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to usual and customary terms, (iii) a program is initiated to locate a buyer and actively market the asset for sale at a reasonable price, and (iv) completion of the sale is probable within one year. Real estate held for sale is stated at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less disposal cost, with any write-down to fair value less estimated costs to sell recorded as an impairment loss. For any subsequent increase in fair value less disposal cost, the impairment loss may be reversed, but only up to the amount of cumulative loss previously recognized. Depreciation is not recorded on assets classified as held for sale.\nIf circumstances arise that were previously considered unlikely and, as a result, we decide not to sell the real estate asset previously classified as held for sale, the real estate asset is reclassified as held for investment. Upon reclassification, the real estate asset is measured at the lower of (i) its carrying amount prior to classification as held for sale, adjusted for depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the real estate been continuously classified as held for investment, or (ii) its estimated fair value at the time we decide not to sell.\nReal Estate Sales-We evaluate if real estate sale transactions qualify for recognition under the full accrual method, considering whether, among other criteria, the buyer's initial and continuing investments are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay, any receivable due to the Company is not subject to future subordination, the Company has transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership and the Company does not have a substantial continuing involvement with the sold real estate. At the time the sale is consummated, a gain or loss is recognized as the difference between the sale price less disposal cost and the carrying value of the real estate.\nReal Estate Held for Investment\nReal estate held for investment includes real estate purchased or acquired in full or partial settlement of loan obligations, generally through foreclosure, that is not being marketed for sale and is either being operated, such as rental properties; is being managed through the development process, including obtaining appropriate and necessary entitlements and permits and construction; or are idle properties awaiting more favorable market conditions or properties we cannot sell without placing our REIT status at risk or become subject to prohibited transactions penalty tax. Real estate held for investment is recorded at acquisition at the property's estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. Depreciation of buildings and improvements is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated remaining useful lives of buildings and improvements. Depreciation of tenant improvements is provided on the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease terms. Costs related to the improvement of real estate held for sale and investment are capitalized, whereas those related to holding the property are expensed. We evaluate real estate held for investment periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We evaluate cash flows and determine impairments on an individual property basis. In making this determination, we often obtain new appraisals and/or review, among other things, current and future cash flows associated with each property, market information, market prices of similar properties recently sold or currently being offered for sale, and other quantitative and qualitative factors. If an impairment indicator exists, we evaluate whether the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the property, and if we determine that the carrying value is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell and the carrying amount of the property.\nIncome Taxes\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT. As a result of our REIT qualification and distribution policy, we do not generally expect to pay U.S. federal corporate level income taxes. Many of the REIT requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to net capital gains, to our stockholders. If we have previously qualified as a REIT and fail to qualify as a REIT in any subsequent taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed REIT taxable income.\nWe have elected (or may elect) to treat certain of our existing or newly created corporate subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries (each a \"TRS\"). In general, a TRS of a REIT may hold assets that the REIT cannot hold directly and, subject to certain exceptions related to hotels and healthcare properties, may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. A TRS is treated as a regular corporation and is subject to federal, state, local and foreign taxes on its income and property.\nDeferred Income Taxes - Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities, if any. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A deferred tax asset is also recognized for net operating loss carryforwards of TRS entities. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount that is \"more likely than not\" to be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's TRS entities generating sufficient taxable income in future periods or employing certain tax planning strategies to realize such deferred tax assets. The estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets more likely than not to be realized often requires significant judgment on the part of management because realization may be dependent on the outcome of property sales and/or other events that are difficult to forecast.\nTax Positions - The accounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is \"more likely than not\" that the position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. We have analyzed our various federal and state filing positions and believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions are well documented and supported. There was no reserve for uncertain tax positions recorded as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nSignificant Developments During 2016\nLoan Activity - We originated 23 new loans totaling $97,124,000 (when fully funded) with a weighted average interest rate of 7.67%. We received full or partial repayment on 29 loans in the total amount of $55,764,000 with a weighted average interest rate of 8.0%. We recorded a net increase in specific loan loss allowances on two impaired loans totaling $694,000 and recorded an increase in the general allowance for loan losses of $590,000, for a total of $1,285,000.\nReal Estate Property Sales - We sold seven real estate properties (three partially) for aggregate net sales proceeds of $90,997,000 (including note receivable of $1,595,000) and net gains totaling $24,498,000 ($20,782,000 after portion attributable to non-controlling interest). The sale of one property resulted in the repayment of notes payable totaling $32,881,000.\nReal Estate Construction Projects - We continued the construction of the retail/condominium project owned by ZRV and incurred approximately $24,175,000 in capitalized costs. This project is expected to be completed during the end of the first quarter or beginning of the second quarter of 2017.\nFinancing Activities - We amended the credit and related agreements (the \"CB&T Credit Facility\") with California Bank & Trust (\"CB&T\") and First Bank to increase the maximum potential borrowings from $30,000,000 up to $50,000,000 and to extend the maturity date for borrowings under the facility to March 1, 2018. The amendment also permits the maximum commitment of the lenders, including such additional lenders as may be added by the parties, to be increased up to $75,000,000 if requested by the Company and approved by the lenders. We also repaid all amounts owed under the Secured Revolving Credit Agreement Loan with Opus Bank (the \"Opus Credit Facility\") and the facility has terminated.\nSubsequent Events - The following events have occurred during the first quarter of 2017 and are discussed in further detail in our consolidated financial statements under \"Note 16 - Subsequent Events\" in Item 8 of this Annual Report:\n \u00b7 We sold the last parcel of unimproved land located in Gypsum, Colorado for net sales proceeds of $139,000 at no gain or loss. \n \u00b7 We sold the office condominium complex located in Oakdale, California for net sales proceeds of $732,000 at no gain or loss. \nComparison of Results of Operations for Years Ended 2016 and 2015\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nnm - not meaningful\nRevenues\nInterest income on loans increased $645,000 (8% increase) to $8,922,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $8,277,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income from performing loans as the average balance of performing loans increased between 2015 and 2016 by approximately 70%. This increase was partially offset by the fact that the 2015 period included approximately $1,723,000 of interest income collected on an impaired loan that did not recur during 2016.\nRental and other income from real estate properties decreased $4,814,000 (38% decrease) to $7,977,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $12,791,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the sale of four operating properties during 2015 and five during 2016.\nExpenses\nManagement fees increased $1,235,000 (60% increase) and servicing fees increased $112,000 (60% increase) during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, due to an increase in the average balance of loans in our portfolio of 60% during 2016, as compared to 2015.\nThe maximum management and servicing fees were paid to the Manager during years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The maximum management fee permitted under the Company's charter is 2.75% per year of the average unpaid balance of loans and, accordingly, management fees have (and will continue to) increase proportionately as we deploy capital into loans and increase our loan balances. For the years 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the management fees were 2.75%, 2.75%, 2.75%, 2.74% and 2.67% of the average unpaid balance of loans, respectively.\nIn determining whether to take the maximum management fees permitted, the Manager may consider a number of factors, including current market yields, delinquency experience, un-invested cash and real estate activities. During 2016 and 2015, the Manager chose to take the maximum compensation that it is able to take pursuant to the charter and will likely continue to take the maximum compensation for the foreseeable future.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $290,000 (23% increase) during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher legal, consulting, appraisal, director and audit fees during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nRental and other expenses on real estate properties decreased $1,464,000 (17% decrease) during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to the sale of four operating properties during 2015 and five during 2016. This decrease was offset by an increase in property tax expense and other holding costs on the TOTB North apartment building held within TOTB Miami that could no longer be capitalized to the basis of the project once construction was completed in March 2016 (and before it was sold in September 2016) and also due to an increase in marketing related expenses for the ZRV property currently under construction during 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $794,000 (39% decrease) during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to the discontinuation of depreciation on certain properties that were moved to Held for Sale during 2015 and 2016.\nInterest expense increased $921,000 (48% increase) during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015, due to a higher amount of interest incurred on our lines of credit as the balances were higher during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015, due to an additional $3,830,000 advance taken on the TSV loan with RaboBank (the \"TSV Loan\") during the third quarter of 2015 and due to the fact that interest incurred on the TOTB North construction loan could no longer be capitalized to the renovation project beginning in March 2016 as construction was completed (and before it was sold in September 2016).\nThe provision for loan losses of $1,285,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 was the result of an analysis performed on the loan portfolio. The general loan loss allowance increased $590,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in the balance of performing loans during the year, an increase in the historical loss percentage on commercial loans and an increase in land loans in the portfolio which loan segment has a higher loss factor than the other segments. The specific loan loss allowance also increased $694,000 (net) during the year ended December 31, 2016 due primarily to the recording of a specific loan loss allowance of $733,000 as of December 31, 2016 on one impaired loan as a result of an updated analysis of the collateral value completed based on actual sales of units during 2016.\nThe reversal of the provision for loan losses of $1,027,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 was the result of an analysis performed on the loan portfolio. The general loan loss allowance increased $877,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to an increase in the balance of performing loans during the year (net of payoffs). There was also an increase in the balance of both land and residential loans which have a higher historical loss factor for purposes of the general allowance calculation. The specific loan loss allowance decreased $1,904,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015, because new appraisals obtained during 2015 on two impaired loans reflected increased values of the underlying collateral, thus, resulting in a decrease in the specific allowance on these loans.\nThe impairment losses on real estate properties of $3,228,000 and $1,589,000, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were the result of updated appraisals or other valuation information obtained on certain of our real estate properties during those years.\nGain on Sales of Real Estate\nGain on sales of real estate (excluding gain attributable to a non-controlling interest in 2016) increased $2,679,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, as a result of the sale of seven real estate properties during 2016 (three partially), resulting in net gains totaling $24,498,000 (see further detail under \"Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests\" and \"Real Estate Properties Held for Sale and Investment\" below). The gain from the sale of one of these properties was offset by net income attributable to a non-controlling interest of approximately $3,716,000, as a portion of the gain on sale of the property held within TOTB Miami, LLC was attributable to the non-controlling interest. During 2015, we sold eight real estate properties, resulting in gains totaling $21,666,000 and recognized $153,000 of deferred gain under the installment method related to the sale of the condominiums located in Santa Barbara, California in 2012 due to the remaining repayment of the carry back loan during 2015.\nWe believe, from period to period in the near term, there will be fluctuations in net income resulting from the lag time between the sale of our real estate assets and deployment of the proceeds into new loan investments.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit increased $7,342,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, as a result of the transfer of two properties into ZRV and conversion of ZRV into a taxable REIT subsidiary during the second quarter of 2016, which now makes the income (loss) from these real estate assets taxable. Due to differences between the book and tax basis of these assets and net losses experienced to date, a deferred tax asset and related income tax benefit totaling $7,249,000 was recorded as of December 31, 2016. The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 differed from the statutory tax rate because the properties held within the ZRV TRS had differences between their respective book and tax basis and management now projects that the Company will realize the benefits from deferred tax assets related to these basis differences. The Company also has approximately $5,514,000 of net Federal tax losses to date that can be carried forward to offset taxable income in future years. As a result, a $7,249,000 deferred tax benefit was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 (as compared to income tax expense of $93,000 during 2015).\nNet Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests increased $904,000 (34% increase) during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to the sale of the condominium units and renovated apartment building owned by TOTB Miami, LLC during 2016 as a portion of the gain on sale of approximately $3,716,000 was attributable to our joint venture partner in TOTB Miami. During 2015, we sold the shopping center owned by 720 University and a portion of the gain on sale of approximately $2,479,000 was attributable to our joint venture partner in 720 University.\nComparison of Results of Operations for Years Ended 2015 and 2014\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nnm - not meaningful\nRevenues\nInterest income on loans increased $2,895,000 (54% increase) to $8,277,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $5,382,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to the accretion of the remaining $512,000 discount on an impaired loan as the loan was repaid prior to maturity in the first quarter of 2015, the collection of past due interest related to an impaired loan that we foreclosed on during 2014 of approximately $1,723,000 (as compared to $517,000 that was collected during 2014) and an increase in the average balance of performing loans between 2014 and 2015 of approximately $32,234,000 (96)%.\nRental and other income from real estate properties increased $523,000 (4% increase) to $12,791,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $12,268,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to rental income from a real estate property obtained via foreclosure in December 2014, increased rental rates and/or occupancy on certain of our properties during 2014 and 2015 and increased income from the TSV retail property that was completed and partially occupied during the fourth quarter of 2014, net of the reduction in rental income following the sale of four operating properties during 2015.\nExpenses\nManagement fees amounted to approximately $2,051,000 (19% increase) and $1,727,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Servicing fees amounted to approximately $186,000 (19% increase) and $157,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $382,000 (23% decrease) during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to lower legal, appraisal, consulting and insurance expenses during 2015 as compared to 2014.\nRental and other expenses on real estate properties increased $352,000 (4% increase) during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to expenses incurred on the assisted living facility located in Bensalem, Pennsylvania that was obtained via foreclosure in December 2014 and the completion of the retail complex owned by TSV during the fourth quarter of 2014, and, thus, there was a full year of operating expenses for these properties during 2015. A significant portion of the TSV expenses were charged to tenants as common area maintenance (\"CAM\") reimbursements and reflected in the increase in revenue for the property during the period. These increased expenses were partially offset by a decrease in expenses as a result of the sale of eight properties during 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $203,000 (9% decrease) during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to the sale of five depreciable properties during 2015.\nInterest expense increased $776,000 (67% increase) during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, due to interest incurred on our lines of credit, the loans payable within TOTB and TSV and the amortization of deferred financing costs to interest expense from these debt instruments during the year ended December 31, 2015. All of these debt facilities, other than the CB&T Credit Facility and the Opus Credit Facility, began to incur interest expense subsequent to the third quarter of 2014.\nThe reversal of the provision for loan losses of $1,027,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 was the result of an analysis performed on the loan portfolio. The general loan loss allowance increased $877,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to an increase in the balance of performing loans during the year (net of payoffs). There was also an increase in the balance of both land and residential loans which have a higher historical loss factor for purposes of the general allowance calculation. The specific loan loss allowance decreased $1,904,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015, because new appraisals obtained during 2015 on two impaired loans reflected increased values of the underlying collateral, thus, resulting in a decrease in the specific allowance on these loans.\nThe reversal of the provision for loan losses of $1,870,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014 was the result of an analysis performed on the loan portfolio. The general loan loss allowance decreased $634,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to an increase in performing commercial loans during 2014 and due to refinements in the loss and delinquency factors applied by management to performing loans reflecting the positive trends in the economy from increasing property values over the year. The specific loan loss allowance decreased $1,236,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily because a new appraisal obtained on a $7,535,000 impaired loan reflected an increase in the value of the underlying collateral during 2014, thus, resulting in a decrease in the specific allowance on this loan of $1,248,000.\nThe impairment losses on real estate properties of $1,589,000 and $179,000, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were the result of updated appraisals or other valuation information obtained on certain of our real estate properties during those years.\nGain on Sales of Real Estate\nGain on sales of real estate (excluding gain attributable to a non-controlling interest in 2015) increased $18,575,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2015 was a result of the sale of eight real estate properties during 2015, resulting in gains totaling $21,666,000 (see further detail under \"Real Estate Properties Held for Sale and Investment\" below). We also recognized $153,000 of deferred gain under the installment method related to the sale of the condominiums located in Santa Barbara, California in 2012 due to the remaining repayment of the carry back loan during the first quarter of 2015. The gain from the sale of one of these properties was offset by net income attributable to a non-controlling interest of approximately $2,479,000, as a portion of the gain on sale of the property held within 720 University, LLC was attributable to the non-controlling interest. During 2014, we sold two parcels of land and recognized deferred gains under the installment method in the total amount of $3,242,000.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests increased $2,502,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to the sale of the shopping center owned by 720 University during 2015 as a portion of the gain on sale of approximately $2,479,000 was attributable to our joint venture partner in 720 University.\nFinancial Condition\nDecember 31, 2016 and 2015\nLoan Portfolio\nOur portfolio of loan investments decreased from 56 as of December 31, 2015 to 55 as of December 31, 2016, and the average loan balance increased from $1,906,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $2,358,000 as of December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had two and three impaired loans, respectively, totaling approximately $4,884,000 (3.8% of the portfolio) and $8,694,000 (8.1%), respectively. This included matured loans totaling $4,656,000 and $8,452,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, seven loans of approximately $8,686,000 (6.7%) were past maturity but less than ninety days delinquent in monthly payments as of December 31, 2016 (combined total of $13,570,000 (10.5%) and $8,694,000 (8.1%), respectively, that are past maturity and impaired). Of the impaired and past maturity loans, none were in the process of foreclosure and none involved loans to borrowers who were in bankruptcy. We foreclosed on one loan during the year ended December 31, 2016 with a principal balance of approximately $1,079,000 and obtained the property via the trustee sale. We foreclosed on no loans during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOf the $8,694,000 in loans that were impaired as of December 31, 2015, $7,615,000 remained impaired in 2016 (balance of $4,884,000 as of December 31, 2016) and one loan with a principal balance of $1,079,000 was foreclosed upon during 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately $129,454,000 (99.8%) and $106,502,000 (99.8%) of our loans are interest only and/or require the borrower to make a \"balloon payment\" on the principal amount upon maturity of the loan. To the extent that a borrower has an obligation to pay loan principal in a large lump sum payment, its ability to satisfy this obligation may be dependent upon its ability to sell the property, obtain suitable refinancing or otherwise raise a substantial cash amount. As a result, these loans involve a higher risk of default than fully amortizing loans. Borrowers occasionally are not able to pay the full amount due at the maturity date. We may allow these borrowers to continue making the regularly scheduled monthly payments for certain periods of time to assist the borrower in meeting the balloon payment obligation without formally filing a notice of default. These loans for which the principal and any accrued interest is due and payable, but the borrower has failed to make such payment of principal and/or accrued interest are referred to as \"past maturity loans\". As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had eight and two past maturity loans totaling approximately $13,342,000 and $8,452,000, respectively.\nThere were no loans modified as troubled debt restructurings during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the terms of one impaired loan were modified as a troubled debt restructuring. The loan was rewritten as the borrower had previously paid the principal balance down partially from sale proceeds. The maturity date was extended by six months to April 2015. All other terms of the loan remained the same. The loan was repaid in full during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we held the following types of loan investments:\n\nThe types of property securing our commercial real estate loans are as follows as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nScheduled maturities of loan investments as of December 31, 2016 and the interest rate sensitivity of such loans are as follows:\n\nCurrently, our variable rate loans use as indices the three-month or six-month LIBOR rates (1.0% and 1.32% respectively, at December 31, 2016) or include terms whereby the interest rate we charge is increased at a later date. Premiums over these indices have varied from 6.5% to 9.0% and may be higher or lower depending upon market conditions at the time the loan is made.\nThe following is a schedule by geographic location of loan investments as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our loans secured by real property collateral located in Northern California totaled approximately 53% ($69,179,000) and 71% ($75,971,000), respectively, of the loan portfolio. The Northern California region (which includes Monterey, Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Inyo counties and all counties north) is a large geographic area which has a diversified economic base. The ability of borrowers to repay loans is influenced by the economic strength of the region and the impact of prevailing market conditions on the value of real estate.\nOur investment in loans increased by $22,839,000 (21%) during the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of new loan originations during the year, net of loan payoffs and one loan foreclosure. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had twenty-two and twenty-four construction/rehabilitation loans in our portfolio with aggregate outstanding principal balances totaling $46,330,000 and $34,416,000, respectively.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses increased (decreased) by approximately $864,000, $(1,027,000) and $(1,870,000) (provsion, net of reversals and charge-offs) during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Manager believes that the allowance for loan losses is sufficient given the estimated underlying collateral values of impaired loans. There is no precise method used by the Manager to predict delinquency rates or losses on specific loans. The Manager has considered the number and amount of delinquent loans, loans subject to workout agreements and loans in bankruptcy in determining allowances for loan losses, but there can be no absolute assurance that the allowance is sufficient. Because any decision regarding the allowance for loan losses reflects judgment about the probability of future events, there is an inherent risk that such judgments will prove incorrect. In such event, actual losses may exceed (or be less than) the amount of any reserve. To the extent that we experience losses greater than the amount of its reserves, we may incur a charge to earnings that will adversely affect operating results and the amount of any dividends paid.\nChanges in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\n\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, there was a general allowance for loan losses of $1,974,110 and $1,356,623, respectively, and a specific allowance for loan losses on one loan in the amount of $732,712 and $485,823, respectively.\nReal Estate Properties Held for Sale and Investment\nAs of December 31, 2016, we held title to twenty-two properties that were acquired through foreclosure, with a total carrying amount of approximately $113,123,000 (including properties held in five limited liability companies and three corporations), net of accumulated depreciation of $3,151,000. As of December 31, 2016, properties held for sale total $75,843,000 and properties held for investment total $37,280,000. We foreclosed on one loan during the year ended December 31, 2016 with a principal balance of approximately $1,079,000 and obtained the property via the trustee sale. We foreclosed on no loans during the year ended December 31, 2015. When we acquire property by foreclosure, we typically earn less income on those properties than could be earned on loans and we may not be able to sell the properties in a timely manner.\nChanges in real estate held for sale and investment during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\n\nThirteen of our twenty-two properties do not currently generate revenue. Three of the Company's twenty-four commercial leases are set to expire during 2017. All of the Company's twelve residential leases are either on a month-to-month basis or will expire in 2017. The Company expects that new leases will be signed with existing or new tenants for the majority of these spaces and at rental rates that are at market and are at or above expiring rental amounts.\nFor purposes of assessing potential impairment of value during 2016, 2015 and 2014, we obtained updated appraisals or other valuation support on several of our real estate properties held for sale and investment, which resulted in additional impairment losses on three, one and one properties, respectively, in the aggregate amount of approximately $3,228,000, $1,589,000 and $179,000, respectively, recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\n2016 Sales Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold seven real estate properties (two partially) with details as follows:\n Net Sales Proceeds Gain (Loss) Light industrial building, Paso Robles, California $ 6,023,679 $ 4,557,979 Commercial building in building complex, Roseville, California 455,132 280,836 169 condominium units and 160 unit renovated and unoccupied apartment building, Miami, Florida (held within TOTB Miami, LLC)* 74,072,951 19,292,364 61 condominium units, Lakewood, Washington (held within Phillips Road, LLC) 5,030,384 846,998 2 improved, residential lots, Auburn, California (held within Zalanta Resort at the Village, LLC) 186,353 89,675 Medical office condominium complex, Gilbert, Arizona (held within Zalanta Resort at the Village, LLC) 3,793,870 (30,010 ) Unimproved, residential and commercial land, Gypsum, Colorado (three separate sales) 1,434,273 (540,079 ) $ 90,966,642 $ 24,497,763 * $32,881,000 of proceeds were used to pay off debt securing the properties and $7,934,000 was distributed to the non-controlling interest. \nIn September, 2016, TSV entered into a Purchase Agreement, as amended by Addendum 2, with Jianping Pan, Kawana Holdings LLC which has assigned its rights to Tahoe Chateau Land Holdings, LLC, a California limited liability company (the \"Buyer\"). Pursuant to the amended Purchase Agreement, TSV has agreed to sell to Buyer the approximately 8.0 acres of land and entitlements, including related parking and garage structures, owned by TSV in South Lake Tahoe, California, commonly known as The Chateau at the Village as further described in the Purchase Agreement (the \"Purchased Property\") for a total of $42.5 million, net of seller's credit which includes sales commissions (the \"Purchase Price\"). The property to be sold does not include the existing retail buildings and improvements (the \"Retained Property\").\nThe closing (the \"Closing\") of the transaction is subject to a number of conditions including, among others, a requirement that the responsible agency for the City of South Lake Tahoe, California approve a final subdivision map that is recorded establishing the Purchased Property and the Retained Property as separate legal parcels (the \"Final Subdivision Map\"). If the Final Subdivision Map is not recorded by March 31, 2017, the Closing date will be extended up to 60 days to allow TSV additional time to record the map. If, after such extension, the Final Subdivision Map is not recorded but all other closing conditions are satisfied, Addendum 2 provides that the Closing will be held with respect to the overall property, including the Purchased Property and the Retained Property, with the Retained Property to be conveyed back to TSV upon recording the Final Subdivision Map. There can be no assurance if or when the sale of the Purchased Property will be consummated.\nBuyer has paid $13,000,000 as a refundable deposit into escrow. Of this deposit, $3,000,000 has been released as a seller's credit out of escrow to pay certain Buyer expenses. The additional $32.5 million of Purchase Price is to be paid in cash at Closing.\nAs a result of the execution of the Purchase Agreement, the Company transferred approximately $6,066,000 of land basis from the first phase retail property (currently held for investment) to the second phase land being sold with this transaction. The basis of the property being sold is approximately $28,975,000 as of December 31, 2016.\n2015 Sales Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold eight real estate properties with details as follows:\n\nIn addition to the above table, we recognized gain of approximately $153,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 that had previously been deferred related to the sale of a real estate property in 2012. The gain on the sale of this property was being accounted for under the installment method.\n2014 Sales Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold two real estate properties with details as follows:\n\nIn addition to the above table, we recognized gains totaling approximately $2,951,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014 that had previously been deferred related to the sales of a real estate properties in 2012 and 2013. The gains on the sales of these properties were being accounted for under the installment method.\n2016 Foreclosure Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company foreclosed on one loan secured by an office property located in Oakdale, California with a principal balance of approximately $1,079,000 and obtained the property via the trustee's sale. In addition, accrued interest and advances made on the loan (for items such as legal fees and delinquent property taxes) in the total amount of approximately $70,000 were capitalized to the basis of the property. A specific loan allowance has been previously established on this loan of approximately $495,000. This amount was then recorded as a charge-off against the allowance for loan losses at the time of foreclosure, after a reduction of the previously established allowance in the amount of approximately $47,000 as a result of an updated appraisal obtained (net charge-off of $448,000). The property, along with a unit in the building purchased by the Company in 2015, was contributed into a new taxable REIT subsidiary, East G, LLC, in June 2016. The property is classified as held for sale as a sale is expected to be completed within a one year period.\n2015 Foreclosure Activity\nThe Company foreclosed on no loans during the year ended December 31, 2015.\n2014 Foreclosure Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, Sandmound Marina, LLC (\"Sandmound\") (wholly owned by the Company) foreclosed on a first mortgage loan secured by unimproved land and a marina and campground located in Bethel Island, California with a principal balance of approximately $2,960,000 and obtained the properties via the trustee's sale.In addition, advances made on the loan or incurred as part of the foreclosure in the total amount of approximately $282,000 were capitalized to the basis of the properties. The fair market values of the properties acquired were estimated to be higher than Sandmound's recorded investment in the subject loan, and, thus, a gain on foreclosure in the amount of approximately $257,000 was recorded.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company foreclosed on a first mortgage loan secured by two adjacent, vacant buildings located in San Jose, California with a principal balance of approximately $690,000 and obtained the properties via the trustee's sale.In addition, accrued interest and advances made on the loan or incurred as part of the foreclosure in the total amount of approximately $158,000 were capitalized to the basis of the properties. The fair market values of the properties acquired were estimated to be higher than the Company's recorded investment in the subject loan, and, thus, a gain on foreclosure in the amount of approximately $208,000 was recorded.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company foreclosed on a second mortgage loan secured by an assisted living facility located in Bensalem, Pennsylvania with a principal balance of approximately $3,420,000 and obtained the property via the trustee's sale.In addition, advances made on the loan or incurred as part of the foreclosure in the total amount of approximately $519,000 were capitalized to the basis of the property. In 2012, the Company had purchased the first mortgage loan on this property which it became subject to at the time of foreclosure. Thus, the Company's investment in this loan of approximately $1,079,000 was added to the basis of the property. The fair market value of the property acquired was estimated to approximate the Company's recorded investments in the subject loans.\nMajority-Owned Limited Liability Companies\n720 University, LLC\nWe had an investment in a limited liability company, 720 University, LLC (720 University), which owned a commercial retail property located in Greeley, Colorado. We received 65% of the profits and losses in 720 University after priority return on partner contributions was allocated at the rate of 10% per annum. The assets, liabilities, income and expenses of 720 University were consolidated into the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company.\nIn November 2014, 720 University entered into a Real Estate Sale Agreement pursuant to which 720 University agreed to sell the property for $20,750,000. On January 30, 2015, an initial closing was held for the purpose of refinancing the existing 720 University note payable, and the buyer extended a new loan to 720 University to repay the existing note payable to the bank. The principal amount of the new loan was $9,771,263 and accrued interest at 6.0% per annum until paid off upon the closing of the sale of the property to the buyer. The sale closed in June 2015 resulting in gain on sale of approximately $8,642,000 ($6,163,000 to the Company after the gain attributable to the non-controlling interest or approximately $2,479,000).\nThe net income to the Company from 720 University was approximately $6,437,000 and $355,000 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The non-controlling interest of the joint venture partner of approximately $5,000 as of December 31, 2015 is reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 720 University was dissolved in December 2015.\nTOTB Miami, LLC\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company and two co-lenders (which included OFG and PRC Treasures, LLC, or PRC) foreclosed on a participated, first mortgage loan secured by a condominium complex located in Miami, Florida with a principal balance to the Company of approximately $26,257,000 and obtained an undivided interest in the properties via the trustee's sale. The Company and the other lenders formed a Florida limited liability company, TOTB Miami, to own and operate the complex. The complex consisted of three buildings, two of which were renovated and being leased, and in which 169 units remained unsold and one which has been contributed to a wholly-owned subsidiary of TOTB, TOTB North, and contained 160 vacant units that were recently renovated.\nIn March 2012, we made a priority capital contribution to TOTB in the amount of $7,200,000. TOTB then purchased PRC's member interest in TOTB for $7,200,000. Thus, the remaining members in TOTB are now the Company and OFG. On the same date, the Company and OFG executed an amendment to the TOTB operating agreement to set the percentage of capital held by each at 80.74% for the Company and 19.26% for OFG based on the dollar amount of capital invested in TOTB. Income and loss allocations were made based on these percentages.\nDuring 2014, TOTB contributed the vacant and unimproved 160 unit apartment building to a new wholly-owned entity, TOTB North. TOTB North then entered into a construction loan agreement which provided up to $21,304,000 for the purpose of renovating and improving the apartment building. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the balance on the construction loan was approximately $0 and $16,010,000, respectively. The construction project was substantially completed in March 2016. The loan was repaid in full with the closing of the sale of the TOTB property in September 2016 (see below).\nDuring 2014, TOTB entered into a loan agreement whereby it borrowed $13,000,000 secured by the 154 renovated and leased condominium units in the Pointe building. The outstanding balance as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $0 and $12,693,000, respectively. The loan bore interest at the floating daily three month LIBOR rate of interest plus 4.0% per annum, but in no event lower than 4.25%. Principal and interest was payable monthly with principal amortizing over 300 months. The loan was repaid in full with the closing of the sale of the TOTB property in September 2016 (see below).\nAll of the TOTB and TOTB North properties were sold in September 2016 for net sales proceeds of approximately $74,073,000, resulting in gain of approximately $19,292,000 ($15,577,000 to the Company after the gain attributable to the non-controlling interest of approximately $3,716,000).\nThe non-controlling interest of OFG totaled approximately $0 and $4,524,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The net income to the Company from TOTB was approximately $14,977,000, $311,000 and $573,000 during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nEquity Method Investment in Limited Liability Company\n1850 De La Cruz, LLC\nDuring 2008, we entered into an Operating Agreement of 1850 De La Cruz LLC, a California limited liability company (\"1850\"), with Nanook Ventures LLC (\"Nanook\"), an unrelated party. The purpose of the joint venture is to acquire, own and operate certain industrial land and buildings located in Santa Clara, California that were owned by the Company. At the time of closing in July 2008, the two properties were separately contributed to two new limited liability companies, Nanook Ventures One LLC and Nanook Ventures Two LLC that are wholly owned by 1850. The Company and Nanook are the Members of 1850 and NV Manager, LLC is the manager.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we received capital distributions from 1850 in the total amount of $180,000, $177,000 and $170,000, respectively. The net income to the Company from its investment in 1850 De La Cruz was approximately $179,000, $175,000 and $170,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased from approximately $8,481,000 as of December 31, 2015 to approximately $6,934,000 as of December 31, 2016 ($1,547,000 or 18% decrease) due primarily to cash used totaling $137,626,000 for investment in loans and real estate properties, net repayment of debt and dividends paid, which was offset by cash received totaling $137,107,000 from the sale of real estate properties (net of distributions to non-controlling interest) and principal collected on loans. In addition, the Company used $943,000 in cash for operating activities during 2016.\nInterest and Other Receivables\nInterest and other receivables increased from approximately $1,765,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $2,164,000 as of December 31, 2016 ($399,000 or 23% increase) due primarily to an additional unsecured loan of $250,000 made to our tenant in the assisted care facility located in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. The tenant is in the process of transitioning the facility and business to memory care in order to increase occupancy and income on the property and needed funds to continue to operate during this transition. The remaining increase was due primarily to growth in the loan portfolio during the year.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nDeferred financing costs accounted for as assets increased from approximately $126,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $172,000 as of December 31, 2016 ($46,000 or 36% increase) due primarily to a new origination fee and other loan costs paid on the amended CB&T Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2016, net of amortization of such costs.\nDeferred Tax Assets, Net\nDeferred tax assets increased from $0 as of December 31, 2015 to approximately $7,249,000 as of December 31, 2016 due to the transfer of two properties into ZRV and the conversion of ZRV into a TRS during the second quarter of 2016, which now makes the income (loss) from these real estate assets taxable. Due to temporary differences between the book and tax basis of these assets and net operating losses to date, a deferred tax asset and related income tax benefit totaling approximately $7,249,000 was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDividends Payable\nDividends payable decreased from approximately $2,133,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $1,402,000 as of\nDecember 31, 2016 ($731,000 or 34% decrease) primarily due to a decrease in Federal income taxes paid on undistributed capital gains on behalf of shareholders. In January 2016 a tax payment in the amount $1,314,000 was made (for 2015 undistributed capital gains), whereas in January 2017 a tax payment in the amount of $583,000 was made (for 2016 undistributed capital gains).\nAccounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities increased from approximately $3,359,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $3,700,000 as of December 31, 2016 ($341,000 or 10% increase), due primarily to increased payables related to the construction activities on the property owned by ZRV.\nLines of Credit Payable\nLines of credit payable decreased from $20,916,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $4,976,000 as of December 31 2016 ($15,940,000 or 76% decrease) due primarily to repayments on the lines of credit as a result of net proceeds received on the sales of real estate properties, net of new loan investments during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNotes and Loans Payable on Real Estate\nNotes and loans payable decreased from approximately $45,459,000 as of December 31, 2015 to approximately $33,386,000 as of December 31, 2016 ($12,073,000 or 27% decrease) due primarily to the repayment in full of the TOTB Miami and TOTB North loans totaling approximately $32,881,000 as a result of the sale of the related properties during the year ended December 31, 2016, repayment of two notes payable secured by TSV and ZRV real estate totaling $3,400,000, net of an increase in debt of approximately $19,897,000 from the new ZRV construction loan obtained during the year.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests decreased from approximately $4,529,000 as of December 31, 2015 to $0 as of December 31, 2016 ($4,529,000 or 100% decrease), due to the sale of the properties owned by TOTB Miami and the distribution of net proceeds to the non-controlling interest during the year ended December 31, 2016. The TOTB Miami LLC was dissolved in December 2016.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFunds from Operations\nWe utilize supplemental non-GAAP measures of operating performance, including funds from operations (\"FFO\"), an industry-wide standard measure of REIT operating performance, and adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\"). We believe FFO and AFFO provide investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We determine FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"), as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding real estate-related depreciation and amortization, impairment losses on depreciable real estate, gains or losses on the sales of depreciable real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated ventures.\nWe calculate AFFO by adding or subtracting from FFO the impact of non-cash accounting items, as well as gains/losses on sales of other real estate. We adjust for these items to analyze our ability to produce cash flow from on-going operations, which we use to pay dividends to our shareholders. Non-cash adjustments to FFO include the following: provisions for (reversals of) loan losses; amortization of deferred financing costs; depreciation of other assets; impairment of other real estate; accretion of loan discount; gain on foreclosure of loans; straight-line rental adjustments and deferred income tax benefit.\nOur calculations of FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other REITs. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income as a measure of our operating performance or to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity, nor are they indicative of cash flows from operating and financial activities.\nWe urge investors to carefully review the GAAP financial information included as part of the Annual Report, as well as in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and quarterly earnings releases.\nThe following table reconciles FFO and AFFO to comparable GAAP financial measures:\n\nAsset Quality\nA consequence of lending activities is that losses will be experienced and that the amount of such losses will vary from time to time, depending on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as affected by economic conditions and the financial experiences of borrowers. Many of these factors are beyond the control of the Company or its management. There is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on specific loans or on segments of the loan portfolio.\nThe conclusion that a Company loan may become uncollectible, in whole or in part, is a matter of judgment. Although supervised lenders are subject to regulations that, among other things, require them to perform ongoing analyses of their loan portfolios (including analyses of loan-to-value ratios, reserves, etc.), and to obtain current information regarding their borrowers and the securing properties, we are not subject to these regulations and have not adopted these practices. Rather, management, in connection with the quarterly closing of our accounting records and the preparation of the financial statements, evaluates our loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on management's evaluation of the risk inherent in our loan portfolio and current economic conditions. Such evaluation, which includes a review of all loans on which management determines that full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers among other matters:\n \u00b7 prevailing economic conditions; \n \u00b7 our historical loss experience; \n \u00b7 the types and dollar amounts of loans in the portfolio; \n \u00b7 borrowers' financial condition and adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to pay; \n \u00b7 evaluation of industry trends; \n \u00b7 review and evaluation of loans identified as having loss potential; and \n \u00b7 estimated net realizable value or fair value of the underlying collateral. \nBased upon this evaluation, a determination is made as to whether the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable incurred credit losses in the Company's loan portfolio. Additions to the allowance for loan losses are made by charges to the provision for loan losses. Loan losses deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses. As of December 31, 2016, management believes that the allowance for loan losses of approximately $2,707,000 is adequate in amount to cover probable incurred credit losses. Because of the number of variables involved, the magnitude of the swings possible and management's inability to control many of these factors, actual results may and do sometimes differ significantly from estimates made by management. As of December 31, 2016, two loans totaling approximately $4,884,000 were impaired. One of these loans of approximately $4,656,000 was past maturity as of December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a net increase in the allowance for loan losses of approximately $864,000 (increase in the specific allowance of $694,000, increase in the general allowance of approximately $591,000, recovery of $27,000, net of charge-off of approximately $448,000). Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is sufficient given the estimated fair value of the collateral underlying impaired and past maturity loans and based on historical loss and delinquency factors applied to performing loans by class.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions to our stockholders and other general business needs.\nWe believe our available cash and restricted cash balances, other financing arrangements, and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months.\nWe require liquidity to:\n\nWe intend to meet these liquidity requirements primarily through the following:\n\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented:\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately $822,000 and $158,000, respectively. The decrease during 2016 was primarily due to more cash used for investments in loans and real estate properties and net repayment of debt as compared to cash received from the sales of real estate properties and principal payments on loans during the year. The decrease during 2015 was primarily due to investments in new loans and capitalized costs related to construction on the second phase retail/residential portion of the land now owned by Zalanta, net of proceeds from the sales of eight real estate properties during the year.\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities are primarily rental and other income from real estate properties, net of real estate expenses, and interest received from our investments in loans, partially offset by payment of operating expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, cash flows from operating activities decreased $6,824,000 and increased $2,914,000, respectively, as compared to the previous year. The decrease during 2016 reflects decreased cash flow from rental properties as a result of the sale of four operating properties during 2015 and five during 2016 and higher management and service fees, general and administrative expenses and interest expense during 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase during 2015 was due to increased cash flow from rental properties as a result of increased occupancy and rental rates, completion and leasing of the TSV retail complex during the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased interest income on performing loans and collected on impaired loans during 2015.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the periods presented reflect our investing activity. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, cash flows from investing activities increased $50,825,000 and $29,499,000, respectively, as compared to the previous year. Approximately $41,448,000 was provided by investing activities during 2016 as $145,977,000 was received from the sales of real estate properties, the payoff of loans and transfer from restricted cash, which was partially offset by an aggregate of $104,679,000 that was used for investment in loans and improvements to real estate properties during the year. Approximately $9,377,000 was used in investing activities during 2015 as an aggregate of $93,324,000 was used for investment in loans, improvements to real estate properties and transfer to restricted cash, which was partially offset by net proceeds from the sales of real estate properties and the payoff of loans totaling $83,818,000 during the period.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities during 2016 totaled approximately $41,326,000 and consisted primarily of $28,354,000 of net repayments on our lines of credit and notes payable, $8,144,000 of distributions to non-controlling interests and $4,593,000 of dividends paid to stockholders. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2015 of approximately $3,338,000 reflects net advances on CB&T and Opus Credit Facilities of $9,466,000, $28,603,000 in additional borrowings on notes and loans payable and a $279,000 contribution from non-controlling interest, net of dividends paid to stockholders of approximately $4,817,000, distribution of non-controlling interest of $2,592,000, purchase of treasury stock pursuant to the 2015 Repurchase Plan of $7,503,000, payment of deferred financing costs of $42,000 and repayments of notes payable of $20,056,000.\nDividends\nWe intend to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our Common Stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT annually distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its REIT taxable income, including capital gains, in any taxable year, that it pay tax at regular corporate rates on that undistributed portion. We intend to make regular quarterly distributions to our stockholders in an amount equal to or greater than our REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains, if and to the extent authorized by our Board of Directors. Before we make any distributions, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our REIT taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured investment vehicles, special purpose entities or VIEs, established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intend to provide additional funding to any such entities.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe table below summarizes our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 and in future periods in which we expect to settle such obligations. The table does not reflect the effect of actual repayments or draws on the obligations or any new financing obtained subsequent to year end.\n\n (1) As of December 31, 2016, the Company had the ability to borrow $22,625,000 on its line of credit. (2) Total available to advance for construction is $31,000,000 and management expects that this amount will be advanced monthly to arrive at that balance by April 2017. (3) Variable-rate indebtedness assumes a prime rate of 3.75% (actual rate at December 31, 2016) through the original maturity date of the financing. Interest payable is based on balances outstanding as of December 31, 2016. (4) Amounts represent the commitments we have made to fund borrowers in our existing lending arrangements as of December 31, 2016. \nThe table above does not reflect amounts due to the Manager pursuant to our charter, as described below, as the charter does not provide for a fixed and determinable payment.\nManagement Agreement and Charter\nThe Manager provides services to the Company pursuant to the Management Agreement with the Manager dated May 20, 2013, and is entitled to receive a management fee, servicing fee, late fees, other miscellaneous fees, and the reimbursement of certain expenses as described in the Company's charter. In consideration of the management services rendered to the Company, OFG is entitled to receive from the Company a management fee payable monthly, subject to a maximum of 2.75% per annum of the average unpaid balance of the mortgage loans at the end of each month in the calendar year. In addition, OFG in is also entitled to a monthly loan servicing fee, which, when added to all other fees paid in connection with the servicing of a particular loan, does not exceed the lesser of the customary, competitive fee paid in the community where the loan is placed for the provision of such services on that type of loan, or up to 0.25% per annum of the unpaid principle balance of the loans. Pursuant to the charter, OFG also receives all late payment charges from borrowers on loans owned by the Company, as well as, other miscellaneous fees which are collected from loan payments, loan payoffs or advances from loan principal, payable in cash on a monthly basis following the end of each month.\nIn addition, OFG is reimbursed by the Company for the actual cost of goods, services and materials used for or by the Company and paid by OFG and the salary and related salary expense of OFG's non-management and non-supervisory personnel performing services for the Company which could be performed by independent parties, including tax, accounting, and legal expenses (subject to certain limitations in the Management Agreement). Expense reimbursements to OFG are made in cash on a monthly basis following the end of each month. The Company's reimbursement obligation is not subject to any dollar limitation.\nThe Management Agreement and the terms of the charter compensation and expense reimbursement shall remain in effect for the duration of the existence of the Company, unless earlier terminated by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, automatically, or by OFG, or by the Company in accordance with the Agreement.\nCompany Debt\nThe terms of the Company debt are discussed in further detail in our consolidated financial statements under \"Note 7 - Lines of Credit Payable\" and \"Note 8 - Notes and Loans Payable on Real Estate\" in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nCB&T Line of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company has one credit facility. The total amount available to borrow under the CB&T Credit Facility was $22,625,000 and the balance outstanding was $4,976,000 (leaving $17,649,000 available). As of March 10, 2017, the total amount available to borrow under the CB&T Credit Facility is $41,182,000 and the balance outstanding is $13,314,000 (leaving $27,868,000 available). Interest on borrowings under the CB&T Credit Facility are payable monthly and, as a result of the amendment to the facility entered into in March 2016 to expand the line of credit and extend its maturity, all amounts outstanding under the facility are to be repaid not later than March 1, 2018 and advances may be made up to that date.\nTahoe Stateline Venture, LLC Loan Payable\nThe balance of the TSV Loan was approximately $13,635,000 as of December 31, 2016 and $13,538,000 as of March 10, 2017. TSV borrowed $10,445,000 at the first closing under the TSV Loan and an additional $3,830,000 in September 2015. TSV makes monthly payments of principal and accrued interest and the balance of the loan is due on the maturity date, which is January 1, 2021.\nZRV Construction Loan\nThe construction loan among ZRV and ZRV II as the Borrowers and Western Alliance Bank as the lender (the \"ZRV Loan\") will provide the Borrowers up to $31,000,000, subject to the terms and conditions of the loan, for the purposes of financing the construction of a new mixed-use retail and residential building (the \"Project\") in South Lake Tahoe, California. The balance of the ZRV Loan was approximately $20,214,000 as of December 31, 2016 and approximately $23,408,000 as of March 10, 2017. Monthly interest only payments are required from an established interest reserve. In addition, on the last day of the calendar quarter in which a Certificate of Occupancy is obtained with respect to completion of the first condominium in the Project, and, continuing on the last day of each calendar quarter thereafter during the term of the Loan, $6 million of principal is required to be repaid. The balance of the ZRV Loan is due on August 3, 2018.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have commitments to advance additional funds to borrowers of construction, rehabilitation and other loans (including interest reserves) in the total amount of approximately $31,490,000.\nWe have entered into various contracts for design, architectural, engineering, foundation work and construction for the development of the land owned by ZRV. The aggregate amount of these contracts as of the date of this filing is approximately $33,809,000 of which approximately $26,013,000 has been incurred as of December 31, 2016 in addition to other capitalized costs related to the construction project of $3,801,000 (total of $29,814,000). We expect that all costs for this project will be paid from the construction loan or cash reserves. It is possible that additional change orders will be submitted and construction costs may be higher than expected.\nWe have entered into various contracts for design, architectural and engineering for the development of the land owned by ZRV II. The aggregate amount of these contracts totaled approximately $1,021,000 of which approximately $845,000 had been incurred as of December 31, 2016 in addition to other capitalized costs related to the project of $265,000 (total of $1,110,000). We expect that all costs for this phase of the project will be paid from cash reserves and/or advances from the CB&T Credit Facility. It is possible that additional change orders will be submitted and costs may be higher than expected.\nContingency Reserves\nWe are required to maintain cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as contingency reserves in an aggregate amount of at least 1.50% of Capital (as defined in our charter). Although the Manager believes the contingency reserves are adequate, it could become necessary for us to sell or otherwise liquidate certain of our investments or other assets to cover such contingencies on terms which might not be favorable to the Company. The contingency reserves held in restricted cash were approximately $3,738,000 and $3,809,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.", "item_7_tables": "Table 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

report:\n\n- The company's primary sources of revenue are interest income from loans and income from real estate properties. Revenue decreased 20% in 2016 compared to 2015, mainly due to lower rental income as a result of selling some properties. \n\n- Expenses increased in 2016 compared to 2015, driven by higher management fees, interest expense, and loan loss provisions. This led to an operating loss in 2016 versus operating income in 2015.\n\n- The company had gains on sales of real estate of $24.5 million in 2016 and $21.8 million in 2015. This resulted in net income of $28 million in 2016 compared to $26.2 million in 2015.\n\n- The loan portfolio increased 21% in 2016 as new originations exceeded payoffs and foreclosures. The allowance for loan losses also increased in 2016.\n\n- Real estate assets decreased 26% in 2016 as property sales exceeded acquisitions. Impairment losses were recorded on some properties based on updated appraisals.\n\n- Cash decreased slightly in 2016 as cash from property sales and loan payoffs was exceeded by investments in loans and real estate and debt repayments.\n\n- The company has credit facilities available to fund future loans, along with cash from operations, property sales, and potential equity offerings.\n\nIn summary, the company grew its loan portfolio in 2016 but had lower income from real estate assets. Performance was impacted by impairment losses but gains on property sales remained strong. The company has liquidity to continue growing its loan business going forward."}
