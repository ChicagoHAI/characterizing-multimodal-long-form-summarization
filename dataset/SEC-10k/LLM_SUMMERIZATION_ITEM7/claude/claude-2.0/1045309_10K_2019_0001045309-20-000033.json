See Item 1 (Business-Business Overview) of this Report for a summary description of our business.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nAnalysis of Operations\nWe have set forth in the table below our key operating statistics with percentage changes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. Please refer to this Analysis of Operations when reviewing this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In the table we present financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as well as the non-GAAP financial information described below. We believe that the non-GAAP financial information provides useful supplemental information about the performance of our businesses, improves period-to-period comparability and provides clarity on the information our management uses to evaluate the performance of our businesses. In the table, we have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and reconciliations from those results should be evaluated carefully.\nWe define Adjusted EBIT (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be net income attributable to W. R. Grace & Co. shareholders adjusted for interest income and expense; income taxes; costs related to legacy matters; restructuring and repositioning expenses and asset impairments; pension costs other than service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service costs/credits; gains and losses on sales and exits of businesses, product lines, and certain other investments; third-party acquisition-related costs and the amortization of acquired inventory fair value adjustment; and certain other items that are not representative of underlying trends.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be Adjusted EBIT adjusted for depreciation and amortization.\nWe define Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be Adjusted EBIT (on a trailing four quarters basis) divided by Adjusted Invested Capital, which is defined as equity adjusted for debt; underfunded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans; liabilities related to legacy matters; cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash; net income tax assets; and certain other assets and liabilities. We have modified the presentation of this financial measure to reconcile to return on equity.\nWe define Adjusted Gross Margin (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be gross margin adjusted for pension-related costs included in cost of goods sold, the amortization of acquired inventory fair value adjustment, and write-offs of inventory related to exits of businesses and product lines.\nWe define Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be diluted EPS adjusted for costs related to legacy matters; restructuring and repositioning expenses and asset impairments; pension costs other than service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service costs/credits; gains and losses on sales and exits of businesses, product lines and certain other investments; third-party acquisition-related costs and the amortization of acquired inventory fair value adjustment; certain other items that are not representative of underlying trends; certain discrete tax items; and income tax expense related to historical tax attributes.\nWe define Net Sales, constant currency (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be the period-over-period change in net sales calculated using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period.\nLegacy matters\u201d include legacy (i) product, (ii) environmental, and (iii) other liabilities, relating to past activities of Grace.\nWe use Adjusted EBIT as a performance measure in significant business decisions and in determining certain incentive compensation. We use Adjusted EBIT as a performance measure because it provides improved period-to-period comparability for decision making and compensation purposes, and because it better measures the ongoing earnings results of our strategic and operating decisions by excluding the earnings effects of our legacy matters; restructuring and repositioning activities; certain acquisition-related items; and certain other items that are not representative of underlying trends.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital, Adjusted Gross Margin, and Adjusted EPS as performance measures and may use these measures in determining certain incentive compensation. We\nTOC-Financial Statements\nuse Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital in making operating and investment decisions and in balancing the growth and profitability of our operations.\nWe use Net Sales, constant currency as a performance measure to compare current period financial performance to historical financial performance by excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are not representative of underlying business trends and are largely outside of our control.\nAdjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EPS, and Net Sales, constant currency are non-GAAP financial measures; do not purport to represent income measures as defined under U.S. GAAP; and should not be used as alternatives to such measures as an indicator of our performance. These measures are provided to investors and others to improve the period-to-period comparability and peer-to-peer comparability of our financial results, and to ensure that investors understand the information we use to evaluate the performance of our businesses. They distinguish the operating results of Grace's current business base from the costs of Grace's legacy matters; restructuring and repositioning activities; and certain other items. These measures may have material limitations due to the exclusion or inclusion of amounts that are included or excluded, respectively, in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and thus investors and others should review carefully our financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nAdjusted EBIT has material limitations as an operating performance measure because it excludes costs related to legacy matters, and may exclude income and expenses from restructuring, repositioning, and other activities, which historically have been material components of our net income. Adjusted EBITDA also has material limitations as an operating performance measure because it excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense. Our business is substantially dependent on the successful deployment of capital, and depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs. We compensate for the limitations of these measurements by using these indicators together with net income as measured under U.S. GAAP to present a complete analysis of our results of operations. Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated together with net income and net income attributable to Grace shareholders, measured under U.S. GAAP, for a complete understanding of our results of operations.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

These Discrete Items also reduced pretax income and Adjusted EBIT by approximately $36 million. The earnings effect includes lost margin on lower sales, the costs of adjusting our manufacturing operations in response to lower demand, costs incurred to serve customers and minimize any impact to their operations, and costs related to the FCC catalysts customer bankruptcy. These effects were partially mitigated by an approximately $12 million benefit from cost-reduction activities in response to these events and $8 million of business interruption proceeds from the FCC catalyst customer event, resulting in a net reduction to pretax income of approximately $16 million.\nNet Sales and Gross Margin\nSales for 2019 increased 1.3% overall compared with the prior year, up 3.0% on constant currency. The increase was driven by improved pricing in both segments and all regions. Higher sales volumes in Catalysts Technologies were driven by Specialty Catalysts growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific and the 2018 second quarter polyolefin catalysts acquisition, partially offset by the Discrete Items. Sales volumes in Materials Technologies were up driven by growth in the Americas, partially offset by a decline in Asia Pacific and EMEA.\nGross margin increased 80 basis points to 40.5% from 39.7% for the prior year. Adjusted Gross Margin increased 70 basis points to 41.4% from 40.7% for the prior year. Improved pricing, higher sales volumes, favorable mix, and lower depreciation were partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, including a 20 basis point impact related to higher raw materials and energy costs.\nSales for 2018 increased 12.6% overall compared with the prior year, up 11.4% on constant currency. Higher sales volumes in Catalysts Technologies were driven by the polyolefin catalysts acquisition and growth across all regions except Asia. Sales volumes in Materials Technologies were up driven by growth in Europe, North America, and Latin America.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nGross margin increased 30 basis points to 39.7% from 39.4% for the prior year. Adjusted Gross Margin increased 60 basis points to 40.7% from 40.1% for the prior year. The increases were primarily due to lower depreciation expense, improved pricing, higher sales volumes, and favorable product and regional mix, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs including a 170 basis point impact related to higher raw materials and energy costs.\nThe following tables identify the year-over-year increase or decrease in sales attributable to changes in sales volume and/or mix, product price, and the impact of currency translation.\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019 as a Percentage Increase (Decrease) from 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales Variance Analysis\n</td> <td>Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Currency\nTranslation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Catalysts Technologies\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Materials Technologies\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>By Region:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe Middle East Africa\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America\n</td> <td>(20.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018 as a Percentage Increase (Decrease) from 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales Variance Analysis\n</td> <td>Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Currency\nTranslation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Catalysts Technologies\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Materials Technologies\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>By Region:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>17.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe Middle East Africa\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America\n</td> <td>19.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGrace Net Income\nNet income attributable to Grace was $126.3 million for 2019 compared with $167.6 million for the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a loss recorded for the annual pension mark-to-market adjustment and higher costs related to legacy matters, including charges of $68.0 million for the estimated costs of construction of a new dam spillway at our former vermiculite mine site and $24.0 million related to probable future payments with\nTOC-Financial Statements\nrespect to our former ZAI product (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by lower restructuring and repositioning expenses, higher operating income from our Catalysts Technologies segment, and a lower provision for income taxes.\nNet income attributable to Grace was $167.6 million for 2018 compared with $11.2 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the $143.0 million provisional tax charge for the estimated impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA\u201d), which was recorded in 2017. This was partially offset by higher restructuring and repositioning expenses and a higher provision for environmental remediation in 2018, which was primarily due to the $70.0 million charge for the estimated costs of future remediation-related activities at the Libby, Montana, mine site and surrounding area (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nIn 2018, we completed a study to evaluate the useful lives of our operating machinery and equipment, including a review of historical asset retirement data as well as review and analysis of relevant industry practices. As a result of this study, effective January 1, 2018, we revised the accounting useful lives of certain machinery and equipment, which was determined to be a change in accounting estimate and was applied prospectively. As a result of this change in accounting estimate, depreciation expense with respect to such machinery and equipment was reduced by $23.5 million, resulting in an increase to net income of $18.0 million or $0.27 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018. Estimated useful lives for operating machinery and equipment, which previously ranged from 3 to 10 years, now range from 5 to 25 years.\nAdjusted EBIT\nAdjusted EBIT was $473.2 million for 2019, an increase of 3.6% compared with the prior year primarily due to higher sales and gross profit including the 2019 first quarter benefit of the polyolefin catalysts acquisition, partially offset by the net impact of the Discrete Items, lower income from our ART joint venture, and unfavorable currency transaction effects.\nAdjusted EBIT was $456.7 million for 2018, an increase of 10.3% compared with the prior year primarily due to higher gross profit including the effect of the polyolefin catalysts acquisition, higher income from our ART joint venture, and favorable currency translation, partially offset by business interruption insurance recoveries in the prior year that did not repeat in 2018 and higher operating expenses.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nAdjusted EPS\nThe following table reconciles our Diluted EPS (GAAP) to our Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP):\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except per share amounts)\n</td> <td>Pre-Tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Tax Effect\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After-Tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted Earnings Per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.89\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs related to legacy matters\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension MTM adjustment and other related costs, net\n</td> <td>85.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and repositioning expenses\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit plan adjustment\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Write-off of MTO inventory\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party acquisition-related costs\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense related to historical tax attributes(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discrete tax items, including adjustments to uncertain tax positions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.05\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EPS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Our historical tax attribute carryforwards (net operating losses and tax credits) unfavorably affected our tax expense with respect to certain provisions of the TCJA.

Net income for 2019 reflects a charge related to mark-to-market pension accounting, compared with income related to mark-to-market pension accounting in 2018. Net income for 2017 includes charges related to the TCJA and mark-to-market pension accounting.\nAdjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital for 2019 was 20.2% on a trailing four quarters basis, compared with 20.9% and 24.4% for 2018 and 2017, respectively, on the same basis. The decline from 2018 is primarily due to increased growth capital investments that have not yet been placed into service. These assets are expected to be placed in service beginning in 2020 and will support volume growth over the next few years. The decline from 2017 is primarily due to the polyolefin catalysts acquisition, which was completed on April 3, 2018, and increased invested capital at that date.\nWe manage our businesses with the objective of maximizing sales, earnings and cash flow over time. Doing so requires that we successfully balance our growth, profitability and working capital and other investments to support sustainable, long-term financial performance. We use Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital as a performance measure in evaluating operating results, in making operating and investment decisions, and in balancing the growth and profitability of our businesses.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nSegment Overview-Grace Catalysts Technologies\nFollowing is an overview of the financial performance of Catalysts Technologies for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nNet Sales-Grace Catalysts Technologies\nSales were up 2.3% in 2019, or up 3.4% on constant currency, compared with the prior year. The increase on a constant currency basis was due to improved pricing in all regions and higher sales volumes, partially offset by lower sales volumes from the Discrete Items. The improved pricing in both Refining Technologies and Specialty Catalysts was driven by our focused value-selling efforts. For the trailing 12 months ending December 31, 2019, FCC pricing was up over 200 basis points. Higher sales volumes in Catalysts Technologies were driven by Specialty Catalysts growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific and the 2018 second quarter polyolefin catalysts acquisition, partially offset by lower volumes from the Discrete Items. We are actively working to replace the lost sales volume from the FCC catalysts customer refinery closure, but do not expect to commercialize that volume before late 2020 or 2021. In 2019, we announced 6 new UNIPOL\u00ae polypropylene process technology licenses totaling approximately 2,500 kilotons of annual resin capacity, which will continue to drive long-term catalysts and donor sales. Unfavorable currency translation affected both product groups as the U.S. dollar strengthened, primarily against the euro, compared with the prior-year period.\nGross profit was $641.3 million for 2019, an increase of 5.1% compared with the prior year. Gross margin was 42.8% compared with 41.7% for the prior year. The increases were primarily due to improved pricing, favorable mix, higher sales volumes, and lower depreciation, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs including a 10 basis point impact related to higher raw materials and energy costs and the Discrete Items.\nSales were up 14.6% in 2018, or up 13.7% on constant currency, compared with the prior year. The increase on a constant currency basis was due to higher sales volumes and improved pricing. Higher sales were driven by the 2018 polyolefin catalysts acquisition and growth across all regions except Asia, driven by higher demand from new and existing customers and higher licensing revenues. Favorable currency translation affected both product groups as the U.S. dollar weakened against multiple currencies, especially the euro, compared with the prior year.\nGross profit was $610.0 million for 2018, an increase of 17.0% compared with the prior year. Gross margin was 41.7% compared with 40.8% for the prior year. The increases were primarily due to lower depreciation expense, higher sales volumes, improved pricing, and favorable product and regional mix, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs including a 180 basis point impact related to higher raw materials and energy costs.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nSegment Operating Income (SOI) and Margin-Grace Catalysts Technologies\nSegment operating income was $466.5 million for 2019, an increase of 5.9% compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher sales and gross profit, and business interruption insurance recoveries, partially offset by lower income from our ART joint venture, higher operating expenses including from the polyolefin catalysts acquisition, unfavorable effects of currency exchange rates, and higher amortization. The ART joint venture contributed $27.8 million to operating income, a decrease of $4.0 million from the prior-year period primarily due to an increase in expenses charged to the joint venture by the partners. Segment operating margin for 2019 increased to 31.2%, an improvement of 110 basis points compared with the prior year.\nIn June 2019, a Catalysts Technologies customer experienced a fire resulting in its refinery closure and subsequent bankruptcy. Lost earnings from this Discrete Item in 2019 were approximately $14 million. We recognized a benefit of and received $8.0 million in payments from our third-party insurer during the 2019 fourth quarter under our business interruption insurance policy for a portion of profits lost in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 as a result of the closure. We expect to receive additional insurance recoveries related to this event in 2020. The policy has a $25.0 million limit for this event.\nSegment operating income was $440.5 million for 2018, an increase of 11.4% compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher gross profit, higher income from our ART joint venture, and favorable currency translation. The increase was partially offset by the absence of business interruption insurance recoveries that were included in the prior year and higher operating expenses. The ART joint venture contributed $31.8 million to operating income, an increase of $5.9 million from the prior-year period. Segment operating margin for 2018 decreased to 30.1%, a decline of 90 basis points compared with the prior year, primarily due to the absence of business interruption insurance recoveries.\nIn January 2017, a Catalysts Technologies customer experienced a fire resulting in an extended outage. We recognized a benefit of and received $25.0 million in payments from our third-party insurer during 2017 under our business interruption insurance policy for a portion of profits lost as a result of the outage. The policy had a $25.0 million limit for this event.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nSegment Overview-Grace Materials Technologies\nFollowing is an overview of the financial performance of Materials Technologies for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nNet Sales-Grace Materials Technologies\nSales were down 1.5% in 2019, or up 2.2% on constant currency, compared with the prior year. The increase on a constant currency basis was due to improved pricing and higher sales volumes, partially offset by lower sales volumes from one of the Discrete Items. Pricing improved across all regions, driven by EMEA and the Americas. The increase in sales volumes was primarily driven by higher consumer/pharma sales in all regions, partially offset by lower coatings sales in Asia, EMEA, and North America. The pricing improvement and increased sales volumes were more than offset by unfavorable currency translation as the U.S. dollar strengthened, primarily against the euro, compared with the prior-year period. Our Materials Technologies business segment is particularly sensitive to changes in the euro.\nGross profit was $168.6 million for 2019, a decrease of 4.7% compared with the prior year. Gross margin was 36.5% compared with 37.8% for the prior year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher manufacturing costs including costs directly related to one of the Discrete Items and 50 basis points related to higher raw materials and energy costs, partially offset by improved pricing and lower depreciation expense.\nSales were up 6.5% in 2018, or up 4.7% on constant currency, compared with the prior year. The increase on a constant currency basis was due to higher sales volumes and improved pricing. The increase in sales volumes was primarily driven by higher consumer/pharma and coatings sales in Europe, higher chemical process and coatings sales in North America, and higher sales across all product groups in Latin America. The remainder of the increase was driven by improved pricing across all regions and favorable currency translation as the U.S. dollar weakened against multiple currencies, especially the euro, compared with the prior year.\nGross profit was $177.0 million for 2018, an increase of 6.1% compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher sales volumes and favorable product and regional mix, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. Gross margin was 37.8% compared with 37.9% for the prior year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher manufacturing costs including a 120 basis point impact related to higher raw materials and energy costs, partially offset by favorable product and regional mix, improved pricing, and lower depreciation expense.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nSegment Operating Income (SOI) and Margin-Grace Materials Technologies\nSegment operating income was $97.8 million for 2019, a decrease of 7.4% compared with the prior year, primarily due to lower gross profit and higher operating expenses, including the effects of one of the Discrete Items. Segment operating margin for 2019 decreased to 21.2%, a decline of 130 basis points compared with the prior year.\nSegment operating income was $105.6 million for 2018, an increase of 5.0% compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Segment operating margin for 2018 decreased to 22.5%, a decline of 40 basis points compared with the prior year.\nCorporate Overview\nCorporate costs include functional and other costs such as professional fees, incentive compensation, and insurance premiums. Corporate costs for 2019 decreased 1.1% compared with the prior year, primarily due to lower accruals for incentive compensation, partially offset by higher employee-related costs.\nCorporate costs for 2018 increased 6.5% compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense.\nRestructuring and Repositioning Expenses\nDuring 2019, we incurred $2.6 million of restructuring expenses primarily related to severance costs pertaining to the idling of our methanol-to-olefins ( MTO\u201d) manufacturing facility in China, which were substantially paid in 2019. Restructuring expenses of $14.0 million in 2018 primarily related to the closure of two smaller\nTOC-Financial Statements\nmanufacturing plants, the activities from which have been moved to larger, more cost-effective plants as part of our strategy to capture synergies from our recent catalysts acquisitions. Restructuring expenses of $11.5 million in 2017 primarily related to workforce reduction programs in Grace's manufacturing, supply chain, finance and IT functions. Substantially all costs related to the restructuring programs are expected to be paid by December 31, 2021, but could be paid earlier subject to negotiations around certain plant exit costs.\nRepositioning expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $11.1 million, $32.4 million, and $15.2 million respectively. Expenses incurred in 2019 and 2018 related to a multi-year program to transform manufacturing and business processes to extend our competitive advantages and improve our cost position. Expenses in 2018 also included $11.7 million of severance and stock compensation costs related to employee separations, and write-offs of $8.5 million of previously capitalized plant engineering costs as a result of terminating an expansion project no longer necessary due to the polyolefin catalysts acquisition (see Note 20). Expenses incurred in 2017 primarily related to third-party costs associated with productivity and transformation initiatives, as well as costs related to the Separation. Excluding asset write-offs and stock compensation costs, substantially all of these costs have been or are expected to be settled in cash.\nThe following table presents the major components of restructuring and repositioning expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party costs of manufacturing and business transformation programs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee severance and accelerated stock compensation\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs related to plant closures\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Write-off of engineering costs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs related to the Separation\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total restructuring and repositioning expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDefined Benefit Pension Expense\nDefined benefit pension expense includes costs under U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans that provide benefits to business segment and corporate employees, as well as retirees and former employees of divested businesses where we retained these obligations.\nUnder mark-to-market accounting, our pension costs consist of two elements: (1) certain pension costs\u201d-ongoing costs recognized quarterly, which include service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service costs/credits; and (2) pension mark-to-market adjustment and other related costs, net\u201d-mark-to-market gains and losses recognized annually in the fourth quarter, or at an interim period should a significant event occur, resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets.\nCertain pension costs were $18.4 million, $15.9 million and $13.0 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in discount rates. The increase from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in expected return on assets, partially offset by a decrease in service cost and interest cost due to an increase in discount rates.\nPension mark-to-market adjustment and other related costs, net were $85.9 million, $(15.2) million and $51.1 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These costs are reported in other (income) expense, net\u201d in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2019 mark-to-market pension expense of $85.9 million was primarily due to the decrease in discount rates used to value the projected benefit obligations of our plans from year-end 2018 to year-end 2019, partially offset by higher than expected return on assets. The 2018 mark-to-market pension income of $15.2 million was primarily due to the increase in discount rates used to value the projected benefit obligations of our plans from year-end 2017 to year-end 2018, partially offset by lower than expected return on assets. The 2017 mark-to-market pension expense of $51.1 million was primarily due to the decrease in discount rates used to value the projected benefit obligations of our plans from year-end 2016 to year-end 2017, partially offset by higher than expected return on assets in the U.S.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nInterest and Financing Expenses\nNet interest and financing expenses were $74.8 million for 2019, a 4.7% decrease compared with 2018 primarily due to higher capitalized interest in 2019 related primarily to the growth capital investments. Interest and financing expenses were $78.5 million for 2018, flat compared with 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense (benefit) for 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $56.8 million, $78.1 million and $200.5 million, respectively, on income before income taxes of $183.5 million, $244.9 million and $210.9 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOur 2019 effective tax rate of 31.0% was higher than the 21% U.S. statutory rate. The higher rate was primarily caused by U.S. taxes on foreign earnings and an increase to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by U.S. federal research and development tax credits and the release of certain U.S. liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the utilization of our U.S. federal NOLs, our 2019 effective tax rate reflects a benefit associated with the GILTI deduction, which was not available in the prior year.\nOur 2018 effective tax rate of 31.9% also was higher than the 21% U.S. statutory rate. The higher rate was primarily caused by recognition of the GILTI tax that could not be offset with a corresponding GILTI deduction due to our utilization of federal NOLs in 2018. The geographic mix of income also contributed to the higher rate since the statutory rates in effect for our foreign subsidiaries exceed the 21% U.S. statutory rate.\nOur 2017 effective tax rate includes $143.0 million in charges related to the TCJA. The effective tax rate without the impact of the TCJA would have been 27.3%, lower than the 35% U.S. statutory rate, primarily due to the geographic mix of income and U.S. federal research and development tax credits.\nSee Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources\nFollowing is an analysis of our financial condition, liquidity and capital resources at December 31, 2019.\nOur principal uses of cash are generally capital investments and acquisitions; working capital investments; compensation paid to employees, including contributions to our defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans; the repayment of debt and interest payments thereon; and the return of cash to shareholders through the repurchase of shares and the payment of dividends.\nOn February 8, 2017, we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program of up to $250 million. During the first half of 2019 we repurchased 409,769 shares of Company common stock for $29.8 million. During the second half of 2019, we did not repurchase Company common stock under this program as we prioritized de-leveraging at this time with a focus on lowering our leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2019, $109.1 million remained under the current authorization.\nWe paid cash dividends of $72.6 million during 2019. On February 7, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved an increase in the annual dividend rate, from $0.96 to $1.08 per share of Company common stock, effective with the dividend paid March 21, 2019. On February 4, 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a further increase to $1.20 per share of Company common stock, effective with the dividend to be paid March 17, 2020.\nWe believe that the cash we expect to generate during 2020 and thereafter, together with other available liquidity and capital resources, are sufficient to finance our operations, growth strategy, share repurchase program and expected dividend payments, and to meet our debt and pension obligations.\nOn April 3, 2018, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which provides for secured credit facilities, consisting of:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>a $950 million term loan due in 2025, with interest at LIBOR +175 basis points, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>a $400 million revolving credit facility due in 2023, with interest at LIBOR +175 basis points.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTOC-Financial Statements\nWe used the proceeds from the term loan to repay in full the outstanding borrowings of $507.0 million under our 2014 credit agreement, to fund the 2018 polyolefin catalysts acquisition for $418.0 million, and to make a voluntary $50.0 million accelerated contribution to our U.S. qualified pension plans. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Credit Agreement.\nCash Resources and Available Credit Facilities\nAt December 31, 2019, we had available liquidity of $700.0 million, consisting of $282.5 million in cash and cash equivalents ($189.1 million in the U.S.), $378.5 million available under our revolving credit facility, and $39.0 million of available liquidity under various non-U.S. credit facilities. The $400 million revolving credit facility includes a $100 million sublimit for letters of credit.\nOur non-U.S. credit facilities are extended to various subsidiaries that use them primarily to issue bank guarantees supporting trade activity and to provide working capital during occasional cash shortfalls. We generally renew these credit facilities as they expire.\nThe following table summarizes our non-U.S. credit facilities as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n(In millions)\n</td> <td>Maximum\nBorrowing\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Available\nLiquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expiration Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>China\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 3, 2023\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Singapore\n</td> <td>18.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 3, 2023\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other countries\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 3, 2023, as well as open-ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnalysis of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>392.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>342.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>319.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>(210.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(618.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(129.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>(99.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>316.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(134.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>81.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period\n</td> <td>201.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents, end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>282.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>201.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $392.1 million compared with $342.0 million in the prior year. The year-over-year change in cash flow is primarily due to higher gross profit in 2019 and the $50.0 million accelerated contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2018, partially offset by lower advance payments from customers compared with 2018.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2018 was $342.0 million compared with $319.2 million in the prior year. The year-over-year change in cash flow was primarily due to higher income from continuing operations and the timing of advance payments from customers in 2018, and a 2017 payment of $30.0 million to satisfy a deferred payment obligation to the asbestos property damage trust required under the joint plan of reorganization, partially offset by a $50.0 million accelerated contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans, higher net cash paid for income taxes, and the prior-year dividend received from ART that did not repeat in 2018.\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2019 was $210.1 million compared with $618.5 million in 2018 and $129.2 million in 2017. Net cash used for investing activities primarily includes the net cash paid for capital expenditures and businesses acquired. In 2018, we completed the purchase of the polyolefin catalysts business of Albemarle Corporation for $418.0 million. Our capital expenditures include investments in new capacity, improved productivity, information technology, and maintenance of our manufacturing and office facilities. We\nTOC-Financial Statements\nexpect our capital expenditures in 2020 to be approximately $195 million and have entered into commitments related to a portion of those expenditures. We expect to fund our capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities.\nNet cash used for financing activities in 2019 was $99.4 million compared with cash provided of $316.5 million in 2018 and cash used of $134.8 million in 2017. Cash paid for repurchases of common stock in 2019 was $29.8 million, compared with $80.0 million in 2018 and $65.0 million in 2017. We paid cash dividends of $72.6 million in 2019, compared with $64.6 million in 2018 and $57.3 million in 2017. In 2018, we entered into the Credit Agreement and used a portion of the proceeds to repay in full the borrowings outstanding under our 2014 credit agreement.\nDebt and Other Contractual Obligations\nTotal debt outstanding at December 31, 2019, was $1,980.4 million.

This plan is qualified under section 401(k) of the U.S. tax code. Currently, we contribute an amount equal to 100% of employee contributions, up to 6% of an individual employee's salary or wages. Our costs related to this benefit plan were $13.9 million, $12.6 million and $11.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nU.S. salaried employees and certain U.S. hourly employees hired on or after January 1, 2017, and employees in Germany hired on or after January 1, 2016, participate in enhanced defined contribution plans instead of defined benefit pension plans. For the U.S. plan, we contribute 4% of an individual employee's salary or wages. For the German plan, contributions vary based on the individual employee's contributions and other factors. Our cost related to these enhanced defined contribution plans established in the United States and\nTOC-Financial Statements\nGermany was $3.7 million, $1.9 million, and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We expect these amounts to increase in the future as more employees enroll in these plans.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for our employees in the U.S., Canada, Germany, and a number of other countries, and fund government-sponsored programs in other countries where we operate. Certain of our defined benefit pension plans are advance-funded and others are pay-as-you-go. The advance-funded plans are administered by trustees who receive direction related to the management of plan assets and arrange to have obligations paid when due. Our most significant advance-funded plans cover current and former salaried employees in the U.S. and employees covered by collective bargaining agreements at certain of our U.S. facilities. Our U.S. advance-funded plans are qualified under the U.S. tax code.\nThe following table presents the funded status of our underfunded and unfunded pension plans:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fully-Funded\nPension Plans(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Underfunded\nPension Plans(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unfunded\nPension Plans(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected benefit obligation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,022.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>920.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>448.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>380.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value of plan assets\n</td> <td>44.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>936.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>852.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funded status (PBO basis)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(86.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(67.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(448.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(380.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Plans intended to be advance-funded.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Plans intended to be pay-as-you-go.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We have both fully-funded and underfunded pension plans. Our fully-funded plans have assets in excess of projected benefit obligation ( PBO\u201d) of $8.5 million at December 31, 2019. Underfunded plans include a group of advance-funded plans that are underfunded on a PBO basis by a total of $86.1 million as of December 31, 2019. Additionally, we have several plans that are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis, and therefore, the entire PBO for these plans of $448.5 million at December 31, 2019, is unfunded. The net funded status of all of these plans was $526.1 million as of December 31, 2019, and is presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows: $8.5 million in other assets,\u201d $14.8 million in other current liabilities,\u201d $434.6 million in unfunded defined benefit pension plans,\u201d and $85.2 million in underfunded defined benefit pension plans.\u201d\nAt the December 31, 2019, measurement date for the U.S. advance-funded plans, the PBO was $1,029.4 million as measured under U.S. GAAP. The PBO is measured as the present value (using a 3.13% weighted average discount rate as of December 31, 2019) of vested and non-vested benefits earned from employee service to date, based upon current services and estimated future pay increases for active employees. Of the participants in the U.S. advance-funded plans, approximately 79% are retired or former employees or employees of our former businesses, which shortens the duration of the PBO. Assets available to fund the PBO for the U.S. advance-funded plans at December 31, 2019, were $955.6 million, or $73.8 million less than the measured obligation.\nThe following table presents the components of cash contributions for the advance-funded and pay-as-you-go plans:\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. advance-funded plans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. pay-as-you-go plans\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-U.S. advance-funded plans\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-U.S. pay-as-you-go plans\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Cash Contributions\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe intend to fund non-U.S. pension plans based upon applicable legal requirements and actuarial and trustee recommendations. We contributed $9.1 million related to these plans in 2019.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nOther Contingencies\nSee Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our other contingent matters.\nInflation\nWe recognize that inflationary pressures may have an adverse effect on us through higher asset replacement costs and higher raw materials and other operating costs. We try to minimize these impacts by developing alternative formulations, increasing productivity, hedging purchases of certain raw materials, and increasing prices.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions affecting the assets and liabilities reported at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the revenues and expenses reported for the periods presented. We believe that our accounting estimates are appropriate and the related balances are reasonable; however, actual amounts could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments in future periods. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which the change is identified. Our accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting estimates are described in this section.\nAn accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions and judgments about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period that could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. As part of our quarterly disclosure controls and procedures, management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nContingent Liabilities\nWe have recorded a liability for the resolution of contingencies related to asbestos property damage, environmental remediation, and litigation. We record a liability if we have determined that a loss is probable and we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or have another reasonable basis for recording a liability. We have determined that each of the contingencies discussed below involves an accounting judgment that is material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLegacy Product Liabilities\nWe emerged from an asbestos-related Chapter 11 bankruptcy on February 3, 2014, as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Under the plan of reorganization, all pending and future asbestos-related claims are channeled for resolution to either the PI Trust or the PD Trust. The trusts are the sole recourse for holders of asbestos-related claims. The channeling injunctions issued by the bankruptcy court prohibit holders of asbestos-related claims from asserting such claims directly against us.\nWe have satisfied all of our financial obligations to the PI Trust. We have contingent financial obligations remaining to the PD Trust. With respect to ZAI PD Claims, the PD Trust was funded with $49.4 million (net of $15 million of attorneys' fees) to pay claims and expenses. We are also obligated to make up to 10 contingent deferred payments of $8 million per year to the PD Trust during the 20-year period beginning on the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date, with each such payment due only if the assets of the PD Trust in respect of ZAI PD Claims fall below $10 million during the preceding year. As of December 31, 2019, the PD Trust has paid out approximately $29 million in ZAI PD Claims and expenses, leaving a balance of approximately $23 million, including the benefit of realized investment gains.\nDue to the limited claims history, the unique nature of this product, and the uncertainty of future claims patterns, an actuarial analysis was completed to estimate the range of possible future payments. The analysis was conducted by a third-party actuarial firm directed by us and using historical claims data provided by the ZAI trustee. Certain key assumptions employed in the analysis were (1) projections of the future number of filed claims, assuming a percentage increase in claims during earlier years and annual decreases in later years; (2) application of historical percentages of claims closed with indemnity payment compared to total closed claims, applied on a regional basis; and (3) application of the average claim payout, which reflects the average indemnity cost per claim closing with payment. As a result of the analysis and taking into account the relative uncertainty of\nTOC-Financial Statements\nfuture claims activity, we determined that contingent funding obligations beyond the next five years are not reasonably estimable. We estimate that the reasonable range of payments over the next five years is expected to be between $16 million and $24 million and project that the first payment could be due in 2022. In the 2019 fourth quarter, we recorded a reserve in the amount of $24.0 million related to probable future obligations to fund the PD Trust for ZAI PD Claims. Our maximum financial obligation over the next 19 years is $80.0 million, and no single year's obligation can exceed $8.0 million.\nWith respect to Other PD Claims, claims unresolved as of the Effective Date are to be litigated in the bankruptcy court and any future claims are to be litigated in a federal district court, in each case pursuant to procedures approved by the bankruptcy court. To the extent any such Other PD Claims are determined to be allowed claims, they are to be paid in cash by the PD Trust. We are obligated to make a payment to the PD Trust every six months in the amount of any Other PD Claims allowed during the preceding six months plus interest (if applicable) and the amount of PD Trust expenses for the preceding six months. We have not paid any Other PD Claims since emergence. Annual expenses have been approximately $0.2 million per year. The aggregate amount to be paid under the PD Obligation is not capped, and we may be obligated to make additional payments to the PD Trust in respect of the PD Obligation. We have accrued for those unresolved Other PD Claims that we believe are probable and estimable. We have not accrued for other unresolved or unasserted Other PD Claims as we do not believe that payment is probable.\nAll payments to the PD Trust required after the Effective Date are secured by our obligation to issue 77,372,257 shares of Company common stock to the PD Trust in the event of default, subject to customary anti-dilution provisions.\nEnvironmental Remediation\nWe are obligated under applicable law to remediate certain properties related to our business or former businesses. At some sites we outsource all or a portion of the remediation to third parties, and at others we perform the required remediation ourselves. Our environmental remediation obligation has a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. See disclosure in this Report in Item 1 (Business-Environment, Health and Safety Matters) and in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our environmental remediation liabilities.\nAt sites where third parties conduct remediation, we estimate our obligations from information available to us from these third parties and other consultants, including actual costs incurred, expected future costs and time to completion. At sites where we conduct remediation, we work with regulatory authorities to define compliance requirements and then estimate the cost required to meet those requirements with information available to us. We base our estimates on our historical knowledge and engineering assessments specific to conditions at each site, and we update our estimates as necessary.\nOur estimates can fluctuate significantly due to the extended duration of some remediation projects. The accuracy of our estimates is dependent on the validity of assumptions regarding regulatory approaches and such matters as labor rates, indirect costs and capital costs, which are each difficult to forecast over extended periods. Future changes in estimates, if required, may lead to material adjustments to our Consolidated Financial Statements, and the ultimate resolution of these obligations could have a material impact on our liquidity and capital resources.\nWe purchased a vermiculite mine in Libby, Montana, in 1963 and operated it until 1990. Vermiculite concentrate from the Libby mine was used in the manufacture of attic insulation and other products. Some of the vermiculite ore contained naturally occurring asbestos. We are engaged with the EPA and other federal, state and local governmental agencies in a remedial investigation and feasibility study of the Libby mine and the surrounding area, known as OU3. The RI/FS will determine the specific areas within OU3 requiring remediation and will identify possible remedial action alternatives. Possible remedial actions within OU3 are wide-ranging, from institutional controls such as land use restrictions, to more active measures involving soil removal, containment projects, or other protective measures.\nAs part of the RI/FS process, we contracted an engineering and consulting firm to develop a range of possible remedial alternatives and associated cost estimates for OU3. Based on this work, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $70.0 million in the 2018 third quarter for the estimated costs of remediation of OU3. We believe that\nTOC-Financial Statements\nthis amount should provide for a protective remedy meeting the statutory requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act.\nThe estimated costs of remediation are preliminary and consist of several components, each of which may vary significantly as the remedial alternatives are further developed. It is reasonably possible that the ultimate costs of remediation could range between $30 million and $170 million. We are working closely with the EPA, and the ultimate remedy will be determined by the EPA after the RI/FS is finalized. Such remedy will be set forth in a ROD that is currently expected to be issued by the EPA no earlier than 2021. Costs associated with the more active remedial alternatives would be expected to be incurred over a decade or more. We will reevaluate our estimated liability as remedial alternatives evolve based on further work by the engineering and consulting firm and discussions with the EPA as the RI/FS process moves toward a ROD. Technical memoranda expected prior to the issuance of the ROD may provide insight into the likely remedial alternatives ultimately selected, allowing us to update our cost of remediation estimate. Depending on the remedial alternatives that the EPA selects in the ROD, the total cost of remediating OU3 may exceed our current estimate by material amounts.\nWe have cooperated with the EPA in investigating and remediating a number of formerly owned or operated sites that processed Libby vermiculite into finished products. We have recorded a liability for remaining expected EPA response and oversight costs, and for potential future site remediation, where a review has indicated that liability is probable and the cost is estimable. The EPA may commence additional investigations in the future at other sites that processed Libby vermiculite. Liability for unaccrued additional investigation and remediation costs is probable but not yet estimable, and could be material.\nOther Legacy Liabilities\nOn April 3, 2019, the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation issued a five-year operating permit for a dam at the Libby mine site. We constructed the dam in 1971 to prevent vermiculite ore tailings from moving into nearby creeks and rivers. The permit requires us to complete construction of a new spillway before the permit is further renewed in five years. We contracted a third-party engineering and consulting firm to develop a range of cost estimates for the project. Based on this work we recorded pre-tax charges of $68.0 million in 2019 for the estimated costs of the project. These costs are preliminary and may vary significantly as the project progresses. Based on the consultants' estimates, we believe it is reasonably possible that the ultimate costs of this project could range between $50 million and $100 million. Construction of the new spillway is expected to take three to four years.\nLitigation\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business. To estimate the cost to resolve our legal obligations, we review the facts of each matter to determine the merits of the case and the corresponding probability of a loss. If we determine that a loss is probable, we determine if there is sufficient information to make a reasonable estimate of the loss amount. Our estimates regarding the outcome of our legal proceedings and claims involve substantial uncertainties that could cause our actual losses to differ materially from our estimates. In estimating the likely outcome of a legal proceeding, we consider the nature of the specific claim (or unasserted claim), our experience with similar claims, the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is filed, court rulings, the status of any settlement negotiations, the likelihood of resolution through settlement or alternative dispute resolution, the proceeding's current status and other relevant information and events. We adjust our recorded liability for litigation contingencies as necessary to reflect our current evaluation of these and other factors.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to allocate the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations.\u201d The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded to goodwill. The assessment of fair value requires management to make significant estimates, including future expected revenues, earnings, and cash flows; expected useful lives; and attrition and discount rates. The allocation of the purchase price may be adjusted during the measurement period, which may not exceed one year after the acquisition date.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nWe review our finite-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. We have no indefinite-lived intangible assets. There were no impairment charges recorded in any of the periods presented.\nWe review our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at October 31 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. We have identified our operating segments as reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Our Catalysts Technologies reportable segment has two reporting units for goodwill impairment testing, which are our Refining Technologies and Specialty Catalysts operating segments. Our Materials Technologies operating segment represents a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing.\nWe performed a qualitative analysis as of October 31, 2019, and concluded that the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values.\nPension Expenses and Liabilities\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for our employees in the United States and a number of other countries, including Canada and Germany, and fund government-sponsored programs in other countries where we operate. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of our pension plans.\nIn order to estimate our pension expenses and liabilities we evaluate the range of possible assumptions to be used in the calculation of pension expenses and liabilities. We select the assumptions that we believe to be most indicative of factors such as participant demographics, past experiences and market indices, and provide the assumptions to independent actuaries. These assumptions are updated annually and primarily include factors such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, retirement rates, and rate of compensation increase. The independent actuaries review our assumptions for reasonableness, and use the assumptions to calculate our estimated liability and future pension expense. We review the actuarial reports for reasonableness and adjust our expenses, assets and liabilities to reflect the amounts calculated in the actuarial reports.\nOur method of accounting for actuarial gains and losses relating to its global defined benefit pension plans is referred to as mark-to-market accounting.\u201d Under mark-to-market accounting, our pension costs consist of two elements: (1) ongoing costs recognized quarterly, which include service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service costs/credits; and (2) mark-to-market gains and losses recognized annually in the fourth quarter resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets. Should a significant event occur, our pension obligation and plan assets are remeasured at an interim period, and the gains or losses on remeasurement are recognized in that period.\nThe two key assumptions used in determining our ongoing quarterly pension expense (excluding the effects of the annual mark-to-market adjustment) are the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. Our most significant pension assets and pension liabilities relate to U.S. pension plans.\nThe assumed discount rate for pension plans reflects the market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available and is subject to change based on changes in overall market interest rates. For the U.S. pension plans, the assumed weighted average discount rate was selected in consultation with our independent actuaries, based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan.\nWe selected the expected return on plan assets for the U.S. qualified pension plans for 2019 in consultation with our independent actuaries, using an expected return model. The model determines the weighted average return for an investment portfolio based on the target asset allocation and expected future returns for each asset class, which were developed using a building block approach based on observable inflation, available interest rate information, current market characteristics, and historical results.\nThe following table reflects the sensitivity of 2020 pre-tax expense (excluding the effects of the annual mark-to-market adjustment) and our year-end PBO to a change in the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets assumptions for the U.S. pension plans:\nTOC-Financial Statements\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in Assumption\n(In millions)\n</td> <td>Effect on 2020\nPre-Tax Pension\nExpense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect on December 31, 2019 PBO\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 basis point decrease in discount rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 basis point increase in discount rate\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 basis point decrease in expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 basis point increase in expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is primarily determined based on our pre-tax income and the statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The effective tax rate also reflects the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax returns, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets are also recorded for NOL and federal tax credit carryforwards.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized by applying enacted tax rates to temporary differences that exist as of the balance sheet date. We reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. The need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed quarterly. In assessing the requirement for, and amount of, a valuation allowance in accordance with the more likely than not standard, we give appropriate consideration to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability and foreign source income ( FSI\u201d), the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforward expirations. A history of cumulative losses is a significant piece of negative evidence used in our assessment. If a history of cumulative losses is incurred for a tax jurisdiction, forecasts of future profitability are not used as positive evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets in the assessment.\nOur net deferred income tax assets (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) as of December 31, 2019, include deferred U.S. federal income tax assets representing federal tax credit carryforwards of $294.7 million and federal NOL carryforwards of $1.2 million, state NOL deferred income tax assets of $51.3 million, and foreign NOL deferred tax assets of $9.6 million. We have established valuation allowances in the amount of $24.1 million, consisting of $10.1 million for state NOL carryforwards, $13.8 million for foreign deferred tax assets, primarily foreign operating loss carryforwards, and $0.2 million for federal NOL carryforwards.\nThe federal tax credit carryforwards arose primarily as a result of the payment of intercompany dividends from our foreign affiliates, from the mandatory repatriation under the TCJA, and from research and development credits. The state NOLs arose primarily as a result of the amounts paid as a result of our bankruptcy proceedings.\nIn order to fully utilize our U.S. federal tax credits before they expire from 2021 to 2039, we will need to generate income of approximately $1.4 billion. We will need to generate approximately $2.5 billion for state income tax purposes during the respective realization periods (ranging from 2020 to 2036) in order to fully realize the state NOLs.\nInherent in determining our effective tax rate are judgments regarding business plans and expectations about future operations. These judgments include the amount and geographic mix of future taxable income, the amount of FSI, limitations on the usage of NOL carryforwards, the impact of ongoing or potential tax audits, and other future tax consequences.\nOur ability to utilize deferred tax assets may be impacted by certain future events, such as changes in tax legislation or insufficient future taxable income or FSI prior to expiration of certain deferred tax assets.\nWe recognize the tax benefits of an uncertain tax position if those benefits are more likely than not to be sustained based on existing tax law. Additionally, we establish a reserve for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained based on existing tax law, if the ultimate benefit to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities is uncertain. Unrecognized tax benefits are subsequently recognized at the time the\nTOC-Financial Statements\nmore likely than not recognition threshold is met, the tax matter is effectively settled or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine and challenge the tax position has expired, whichever is earlier.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their effect on us.\nTOC-Financial Statements", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSee Analysis of Operations\u201d for a discussion of our non-GAAP performance measures. Our references to advanced economies\u201d and emerging regions\u201d refer to classifications established by the International Monetary Fund.\nResults of Operations\n2019 Performance Summary\nFollowing is a summary of our financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with the prior year.\n \u2022 Net sales increased 1.3% to $1,958.1 million. \n \u2022 Net income attributable to Grace shareholders decreased to $126.3 million. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBIT1 increased 3.6% to $473.2 million. \n \u2022 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased to $1.89 per diluted share. \n \u2022 Adjusted EPS1 increased 5.8% to $4.38 per diluted share.  1 Non-GAAP performance measures further discussed below.\nSummary Description of Business\nWe are engaged in specialty chemicals and specialty materials businesses on a worldwide basis through our two reportable segments, Grace Catalysts Technologies and Grace Materials Technologies. See Item 1 (Business-Business Overview) of this Report for a summary description of our business.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nAnalysis of Operations\nWe have set forth in the table below our key operating statistics with percentage changes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. Please refer to this Analysis of Operations when reviewing this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In the table we present financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as well as the non-GAAP financial information described below. We believe that the non-GAAP financial information provides useful supplemental information about the performance of our businesses, improves period-to-period comparability and provides clarity on the information our management uses to evaluate the performance of our businesses. In the table, we have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and reconciliations from those results should be evaluated carefully.\nWe define Adjusted EBIT (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be net income attributable to W. R. Grace & Co. shareholders adjusted for interest income and expense; income taxes; costs related to legacy matters; restructuring and repositioning expenses and asset impairments; pension costs other than service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service costs/credits; gains and losses on sales and exits of businesses, product lines, and certain other investments; third-party acquisition-related costs and the amortization of acquired inventory fair value adjustment; and certain other items that are not representative of underlying trends.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be Adjusted EBIT adjusted for depreciation and amortization.\nWe define Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be Adjusted EBIT (on a trailing four quarters basis) divided by Adjusted Invested Capital, which is defined as equity adjusted for debt; underfunded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans; liabilities related to legacy matters; cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash; net income tax assets; and certain other assets and liabilities. We have modified the presentation of this financial measure to reconcile to return on equity.\nWe define Adjusted Gross Margin (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be gross margin adjusted for pension-related costs included in cost of goods sold, the amortization of acquired inventory fair value adjustment, and write-offs of inventory related to exits of businesses and product lines.\nWe define Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be diluted EPS adjusted for costs related to legacy matters; restructuring and repositioning expenses and asset impairments; pension costs other than service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service costs/credits; gains and losses on sales and exits of businesses, product lines and certain other investments; third-party acquisition-related costs and the amortization of acquired inventory fair value adjustment; certain other items that are not representative of underlying trends; certain discrete tax items; and income tax expense related to historical tax attributes.\nWe define Net Sales, constant currency (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be the period-over-period change in net sales calculated using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period.\nLegacy matters\u201d include legacy (i) product, (ii) environmental, and (iii) other liabilities, relating to past activities of Grace.\nWe use Adjusted EBIT as a performance measure in significant business decisions and in determining certain incentive compensation. We use Adjusted EBIT as a performance measure because it provides improved period-to-period comparability for decision making and compensation purposes, and because it better measures the ongoing earnings results of our strategic and operating decisions by excluding the earnings effects of our legacy matters; restructuring and repositioning activities; certain acquisition-related items; and certain other items that are not representative of underlying trends.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital, Adjusted Gross Margin, and Adjusted EPS as performance measures and may use these measures in determining certain incentive compensation. We\nTOC-Financial Statements\nuse Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital in making operating and investment decisions and in balancing the growth and profitability of our operations.\nWe use Net Sales, constant currency as a performance measure to compare current period financial performance to historical financial performance by excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are not representative of underlying business trends and are largely outside of our control.\nAdjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EPS, and Net Sales, constant currency are non-GAAP financial measures; do not purport to represent income measures as defined under U.S. GAAP; and should not be used as alternatives to such measures as an indicator of our performance. These measures are provided to investors and others to improve the period-to-period comparability and peer-to-peer comparability of our financial results, and to ensure that investors understand the information we use to evaluate the performance of our businesses. They distinguish the operating results of Grace's current business base from the costs of Grace's legacy matters; restructuring and repositioning activities; and certain other items. These measures may have material limitations due to the exclusion or inclusion of amounts that are included or excluded, respectively, in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and thus investors and others should review carefully our financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nAdjusted EBIT has material limitations as an operating performance measure because it excludes costs related to legacy matters, and may exclude income and expenses from restructuring, repositioning, and other activities, which historically have been material components of our net income. Adjusted EBITDA also has material limitations as an operating performance measure because it excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense. Our business is substantially dependent on the successful deployment of capital, and depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs. We compensate for the limitations of these measurements by using these indicators together with net income as measured under U.S. GAAP to present a complete analysis of our results of operations. Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated together with net income and net income attributable to Grace shareholders, measured under U.S. GAAP, for a complete understanding of our results of operations.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

ongoing costs recognized quarterly, which include service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service costs/credits. Catalysts Technologies and Materials Technologies segment operating income and corporate costs do not include any amounts for pension expense. Other pension-related costs including annual mark-to-market (MTM) adjustments and actuarial gains and losses are excluded from Adjusted EBIT. These amounts are not used by management to evaluate the performance of Grace's businesses and significantly affect the peer-to-peer and period-to-period comparability of our financial results.

These Discrete Items reduced 2019 full-year net sales by approximately $36 million. These Discrete Items also reduced pretax income and Adjusted EBIT by approximately $36 million. The earnings effect includes lost margin on lower sales, the costs of adjusting our manufacturing operations in response to lower demand, costs incurred to serve customers and minimize any impact to their operations, and costs related to the FCC catalysts customer bankruptcy. These effects were partially mitigated by an approximately $12 million benefit from cost-reduction activities in response to these events and $8 million of business interruption proceeds from the FCC catalyst customer event, resulting in a net reduction to pretax income of approximately $16 million.\nNet Sales and Gross Margin\nSales for 2019 increased 1.3% overall compared with the prior year, up 3.0% on constant currency. The increase was driven by improved pricing in both segments and all regions. Higher sales volumes in Catalysts Technologies were driven by Specialty Catalysts growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific and the 2018 second quarter polyolefin catalysts acquisition, partially offset by the Discrete Items. Sales volumes in Materials Technologies were up driven by growth in the Americas, partially offset by a decline in Asia Pacific and EMEA.\nGross margin increased 80 basis points to 40.5% from 39.7% for the prior year. Adjusted Gross Margin increased 70 basis points to 41.4% from 40.7% for the prior year. Improved pricing, higher sales volumes, favorable mix, and lower depreciation were partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, including a 20 basis point impact related to higher raw materials and energy costs.\nSales for 2018 increased 12.6% overall compared with the prior year, up 11.4% on constant currency. Higher sales volumes in Catalysts Technologies were driven by the polyolefin catalysts acquisition and growth across all regions except Asia. Sales volumes in Materials Technologies were up driven by growth in Europe, North America, and Latin America.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nGross margin increased 30 basis points to 39.7% from 39.4% for the prior year. Adjusted Gross Margin increased 60 basis points to 40.7% from 40.1% for the prior year. The increases were primarily due to lower depreciation expense, improved pricing, higher sales volumes, and favorable product and regional mix, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs including a 170 basis point impact related to higher raw materials and energy costs.\nThe following tables identify the year-over-year increase or decrease in sales attributable to changes in sales volume and/or mix, product price, and the impact of currency translation.\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019 as a Percentage Increase (Decrease) from 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales Variance Analysis\n</td> <td>Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Currency\nTranslation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Catalysts Technologies\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Materials Technologies\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>By Region:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe Middle East Africa\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America\n</td> <td>(20.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018 as a Percentage Increase (Decrease) from 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales Variance Analysis\n</td> <td>Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Currency\nTranslation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Catalysts Technologies\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Materials Technologies\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>By Region:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>17.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe Middle East Africa\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America\n</td> <td>19.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGrace Net Income\nNet income attributable to Grace was $126.3 million for 2019 compared with $167.6 million for the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a loss recorded for the annual pension mark-to-market adjustment and higher costs related to legacy matters, including charges of $68.0 million for the estimated costs of construction of a new dam spillway at our former vermiculite mine site and $24.0 million related to probable future payments with\nTOC-Financial Statements\nrespect to our former ZAI product (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by lower restructuring and repositioning expenses, higher operating income from our Catalysts Technologies segment, and a lower provision for income taxes.\nNet income attributable to Grace was $167.6 million for 2018 compared with $11.2 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the $143.0 million provisional tax charge for the estimated impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA\u201d), which was recorded in 2017. This was partially offset by higher restructuring and repositioning expenses and a higher provision for environmental remediation in 2018, which was primarily due to the $70.0 million charge for the estimated costs of future remediation-related activities at the Libby, Montana, mine site and surrounding area (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nIn 2018, we completed a study to evaluate the useful lives of our operating machinery and equipment, including a review of historical asset retirement data as well as review and analysis of relevant industry practices. As a result of this study, effective January 1, 2018, we revised the accounting useful lives of certain machinery and equipment, which was determined to be a change in accounting estimate and was applied prospectively. As a result of this change in accounting estimate, depreciation expense with respect to such machinery and equipment was reduced by $23.5 million, resulting in an increase to net income of $18.0 million or $0.27 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018. Estimated useful lives for operating machinery and equipment, which previously ranged from 3 to 10 years, now range from 5 to 25 years.\nAdjusted EBIT\nAdjusted EBIT was $473.2 million for 2019, an increase of 3.6% compared with the prior year primarily due to higher sales and gross profit including the 2019 first quarter benefit of the polyolefin catalysts acquisition, partially offset by the net impact of the Discrete Items, lower income from our ART joint venture, and unfavorable currency transaction effects.\nAdjusted EBIT was $456.7 million for 2018, an increase of 10.3% compared with the prior year primarily due to higher gross profit including the effect of the polyolefin catalysts acquisition, higher income from our ART joint venture, and favorable currency translation, partially offset by business interruption insurance recoveries in the prior year that did not repeat in 2018 and higher operating expenses.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nAdjusted EPS\nThe following table reconciles our Diluted EPS (GAAP) to our Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP):\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except per share amounts)\n</td> <td>Pre-Tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Tax Effect\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After-Tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted Earnings Per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.89\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs related to legacy matters\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension MTM adjustment and other related costs, net\n</td> <td>85.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and repositioning expenses\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit plan adjustment\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Write-off of MTO inventory\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party acquisition-related costs\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense related to historical tax attributes(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discrete tax items, including adjustments to uncertain tax positions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.05\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EPS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Our historical tax attribute carryforwards (net operating losses and tax credits) unfavorably affected our tax expense with respect to certain provisions of the TCJA.

Net income for 2019 reflects a charge related to mark-to-market pension accounting, compared with income related to mark-to-market pension accounting in 2018. Net income for 2017 includes charges related to the TCJA and mark-to-market pension accounting.\nAdjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital for 2019 was 20.2% on a trailing four quarters basis, compared with 20.9% and 24.4% for 2018 and 2017, respectively, on the same basis. The decline from 2018 is primarily due to increased growth capital investments that have not yet been placed into service. These assets are expected to be placed in service beginning in 2020 and will support volume growth over the next few years. The decline from 2017 is primarily due to the polyolefin catalysts acquisition, which was completed on April 3, 2018, and increased invested capital at that date.\nWe manage our businesses with the objective of maximizing sales, earnings and cash flow over time. Doing so requires that we successfully balance our growth, profitability and working capital and other investments to support sustainable, long-term financial performance. We use Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital as a performance measure in evaluating operating results, in making operating and investment decisions, and in balancing the growth and profitability of our businesses.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nSegment Overview-Grace Catalysts Technologies\nFollowing is an overview of the financial performance of Catalysts Technologies for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nNet Sales-Grace Catalysts Technologies\nSales were up 2.3% in 2019, or up 3.4% on constant currency, compared with the prior year. The increase on a constant currency basis was due to improved pricing in all regions and higher sales volumes, partially offset by lower sales volumes from the Discrete Items. The improved pricing in both Refining Technologies and Specialty Catalysts was driven by our focused value-selling efforts. For the trailing 12 months ending December 31, 2019, FCC pricing was up over 200 basis points. Higher sales volumes in Catalysts Technologies were driven by Specialty Catalysts growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific and the 2018 second quarter polyolefin catalysts acquisition, partially offset by lower volumes from the Discrete Items. We are actively working to replace the lost sales volume from the FCC catalysts customer refinery closure, but do not expect to commercialize that volume before late 2020 or 2021. In 2019, we announced 6 new UNIPOL\u00ae polypropylene process technology licenses totaling approximately 2,500 kilotons of annual resin capacity, which will continue to drive long-term catalysts and donor sales. Unfavorable currency translation affected both product groups as the U.S. dollar strengthened, primarily against the euro, compared with the prior-year period.\nGross profit was $641.3 million for 2019, an increase of 5.1% compared with the prior year. Gross margin was 42.8% compared with 41.7% for the prior year. The increases were primarily due to improved pricing, favorable mix, higher sales volumes, and lower depreciation, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs including a 10 basis point impact related to higher raw materials and energy costs and the Discrete Items.\nSales were up 14.6% in 2018, or up 13.7% on constant currency, compared with the prior year. The increase on a constant currency basis was due to higher sales volumes and improved pricing. Higher sales were driven by the 2018 polyolefin catalysts acquisition and growth across all regions except Asia, driven by higher demand from new and existing customers and higher licensing revenues. Favorable currency translation affected both product groups as the U.S. dollar weakened against multiple currencies, especially the euro, compared with the prior year.\nGross profit was $610.0 million for 2018, an increase of 17.0% compared with the prior year. Gross margin was 41.7% compared with 40.8% for the prior year. The increases were primarily due to lower depreciation expense, higher sales volumes, improved pricing, and favorable product and regional mix, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs including a 180 basis point impact related to higher raw materials and energy costs.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nSegment Operating Income (SOI) and Margin-Grace Catalysts Technologies\nSegment operating income was $466.5 million for 2019, an increase of 5.9% compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher sales and gross profit, and business interruption insurance recoveries, partially offset by lower income from our ART joint venture, higher operating expenses including from the polyolefin catalysts acquisition, unfavorable effects of currency exchange rates, and higher amortization. The ART joint venture contributed $27.8 million to operating income, a decrease of $4.0 million from the prior-year period primarily due to an increase in expenses charged to the joint venture by the partners. Segment operating margin for 2019 increased to 31.2%, an improvement of 110 basis points compared with the prior year.\nIn June 2019, a Catalysts Technologies customer experienced a fire resulting in its refinery closure and subsequent bankruptcy. Lost earnings from this Discrete Item in 2019 were approximately $14 million. We recognized a benefit of and received $8.0 million in payments from our third-party insurer during the 2019 fourth quarter under our business interruption insurance policy for a portion of profits lost in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 as a result of the closure. We expect to receive additional insurance recoveries related to this event in 2020. The policy has a $25.0 million limit for this event.\nSegment operating income was $440.5 million for 2018, an increase of 11.4% compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher gross profit, higher income from our ART joint venture, and favorable currency translation. The increase was partially offset by the absence of business interruption insurance recoveries that were included in the prior year and higher operating expenses. The ART joint venture contributed $31.8 million to operating income, an increase of $5.9 million from the prior-year period. Segment operating margin for 2018 decreased to 30.1%, a decline of 90 basis points compared with the prior year, primarily due to the absence of business interruption insurance recoveries.\nIn January 2017, a Catalysts Technologies customer experienced a fire resulting in an extended outage. We recognized a benefit of and received $25.0 million in payments from our third-party insurer during 2017 under our business interruption insurance policy for a portion of profits lost as a result of the outage. The policy had a $25.0 million limit for this event.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nSegment Overview-Grace Materials Technologies\nFollowing is an overview of the financial performance of Materials Technologies for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nNet Sales-Grace Materials Technologies\nSales were down 1.5% in 2019, or up 2.2% on constant currency, compared with the prior year. The increase on a constant currency basis was due to improved pricing and higher sales volumes, partially offset by lower sales volumes from one of the Discrete Items. Pricing improved across all regions, driven by EMEA and the Americas. The increase in sales volumes was primarily driven by higher consumer/pharma sales in all regions, partially offset by lower coatings sales in Asia, EMEA, and North America. The pricing improvement and increased sales volumes were more than offset by unfavorable currency translation as the U.S. dollar strengthened, primarily against the euro, compared with the prior-year period. Our Materials Technologies business segment is particularly sensitive to changes in the euro.\nGross profit was $168.6 million for 2019, a decrease of 4.7% compared with the prior year. Gross margin was 36.5% compared with 37.8% for the prior year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher manufacturing costs including costs directly related to one of the Discrete Items and 50 basis points related to higher raw materials and energy costs, partially offset by improved pricing and lower depreciation expense.\nSales were up 6.5% in 2018, or up 4.7% on constant currency, compared with the prior year. The increase on a constant currency basis was due to higher sales volumes and improved pricing. The increase in sales volumes was primarily driven by higher consumer/pharma and coatings sales in Europe, higher chemical process and coatings sales in North America, and higher sales across all product groups in Latin America. The remainder of the increase was driven by improved pricing across all regions and favorable currency translation as the U.S. dollar weakened against multiple currencies, especially the euro, compared with the prior year.\nGross profit was $177.0 million for 2018, an increase of 6.1% compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher sales volumes and favorable product and regional mix, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. Gross margin was 37.8% compared with 37.9% for the prior year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher manufacturing costs including a 120 basis point impact related to higher raw materials and energy costs, partially offset by favorable product and regional mix, improved pricing, and lower depreciation expense.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nSegment Operating Income (SOI) and Margin-Grace Materials Technologies\nSegment operating income was $97.8 million for 2019, a decrease of 7.4% compared with the prior year, primarily due to lower gross profit and higher operating expenses, including the effects of one of the Discrete Items. Segment operating margin for 2019 decreased to 21.2%, a decline of 130 basis points compared with the prior year.\nSegment operating income was $105.6 million for 2018, an increase of 5.0% compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Segment operating margin for 2018 decreased to 22.5%, a decline of 40 basis points compared with the prior year.\nCorporate Overview\nCorporate costs include functional and other costs such as professional fees, incentive compensation, and insurance premiums. Corporate costs for 2019 decreased 1.1% compared with the prior year, primarily due to lower accruals for incentive compensation, partially offset by higher employee-related costs.\nCorporate costs for 2018 increased 6.5% compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense.\nRestructuring and Repositioning Expenses\nDuring 2019, we incurred $2.6 million of restructuring expenses primarily related to severance costs pertaining to the idling of our methanol-to-olefins ( MTO\u201d) manufacturing facility in China, which were substantially paid in 2019. Restructuring expenses of $14.0 million in 2018 primarily related to the closure of two smaller\nTOC-Financial Statements\nmanufacturing plants, the activities from which have been moved to larger, more cost-effective plants as part of our strategy to capture synergies from our recent catalysts acquisitions. Restructuring expenses of $11.5 million in 2017 primarily related to workforce reduction programs in Grace's manufacturing, supply chain, finance and IT functions. Substantially all costs related to the restructuring programs are expected to be paid by December 31, 2021, but could be paid earlier subject to negotiations around certain plant exit costs.\nRepositioning expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $11.1 million, $32.4 million, and $15.2 million respectively. Expenses incurred in 2019 and 2018 related to a multi-year program to transform manufacturing and business processes to extend our competitive advantages and improve our cost position. Expenses in 2018 also included $11.7 million of severance and stock compensation costs related to employee separations, and write-offs of $8.5 million of previously capitalized plant engineering costs as a result of terminating an expansion project no longer necessary due to the polyolefin catalysts acquisition (see Note 20). Expenses incurred in 2017 primarily related to third-party costs associated with productivity and transformation initiatives, as well as costs related to the Separation. Excluding asset write-offs and stock compensation costs, substantially all of these costs have been or are expected to be settled in cash.\nThe following table presents the major components of restructuring and repositioning expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party costs of manufacturing and business transformation programs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee severance and accelerated stock compensation\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs related to plant closures\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Write-off of engineering costs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs related to the Separation\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total restructuring and repositioning expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDefined Benefit Pension Expense\nDefined benefit pension expense includes costs under U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans that provide benefits to business segment and corporate employees, as well as retirees and former employees of divested businesses where we retained these obligations.\nUnder mark-to-market accounting, our pension costs consist of two elements: (1) certain pension costs\u201d-ongoing costs recognized quarterly, which include service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service costs/credits; and (2) pension mark-to-market adjustment and other related costs, net\u201d-mark-to-market gains and losses recognized annually in the fourth quarter, or at an interim period should a significant event occur, resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets.\nCertain pension costs were $18.4 million, $15.9 million and $13.0 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in discount rates. The increase from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in expected return on assets, partially offset by a decrease in service cost and interest cost due to an increase in discount rates.\nPension mark-to-market adjustment and other related costs, net were $85.9 million, $(15.2) million and $51.1 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These costs are reported in other (income) expense, net\u201d in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2019 mark-to-market pension expense of $85.9 million was primarily due to the decrease in discount rates used to value the projected benefit obligations of our plans from year-end 2018 to year-end 2019, partially offset by higher than expected return on assets. The 2018 mark-to-market pension income of $15.2 million was primarily due to the increase in discount rates used to value the projected benefit obligations of our plans from year-end 2017 to year-end 2018, partially offset by lower than expected return on assets. The 2017 mark-to-market pension expense of $51.1 million was primarily due to the decrease in discount rates used to value the projected benefit obligations of our plans from year-end 2016 to year-end 2017, partially offset by higher than expected return on assets in the U.S.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nInterest and Financing Expenses\nNet interest and financing expenses were $74.8 million for 2019, a 4.7% decrease compared with 2018 primarily due to higher capitalized interest in 2019 related primarily to the growth capital investments. Interest and financing expenses were $78.5 million for 2018, flat compared with 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense (benefit) for 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $56.8 million, $78.1 million and $200.5 million, respectively, on income before income taxes of $183.5 million, $244.9 million and $210.9 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOur 2019 effective tax rate of 31.0% was higher than the 21% U.S. statutory rate. The higher rate was primarily caused by U.S. taxes on foreign earnings and an increase to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by U.S. federal research and development tax credits and the release of certain U.S. liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the utilization of our U.S. federal NOLs, our 2019 effective tax rate reflects a benefit associated with the GILTI deduction, which was not available in the prior year.\nOur 2018 effective tax rate of 31.9% also was higher than the 21% U.S. statutory rate. The higher rate was primarily caused by recognition of the GILTI tax that could not be offset with a corresponding GILTI deduction due to our utilization of federal NOLs in 2018. The geographic mix of income also contributed to the higher rate since the statutory rates in effect for our foreign subsidiaries exceed the 21% U.S. statutory rate.\nOur 2017 effective tax rate includes $143.0 million in charges related to the TCJA. The effective tax rate without the impact of the TCJA would have been 27.3%, lower than the 35% U.S. statutory rate, primarily due to the geographic mix of income and U.S. federal research and development tax credits.\nSee Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources\nFollowing is an analysis of our financial condition, liquidity and capital resources at December 31, 2019.\nOur principal uses of cash are generally capital investments and acquisitions; working capital investments; compensation paid to employees, including contributions to our defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans; the repayment of debt and interest payments thereon; and the return of cash to shareholders through the repurchase of shares and the payment of dividends.\nOn February 8, 2017, we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program of up to $250 million. During the first half of 2019 we repurchased 409,769 shares of Company common stock for $29.8 million. During the second half of 2019, we did not repurchase Company common stock under this program as we prioritized de-leveraging at this time with a focus on lowering our leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2019, $109.1 million remained under the current authorization.\nWe paid cash dividends of $72.6 million during 2019. On February 7, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved an increase in the annual dividend rate, from $0.96 to $1.08 per share of Company common stock, effective with the dividend paid March 21, 2019. On February 4, 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a further increase to $1.20 per share of Company common stock, effective with the dividend to be paid March 17, 2020.\nWe believe that the cash we expect to generate during 2020 and thereafter, together with other available liquidity and capital resources, are sufficient to finance our operations, growth strategy, share repurchase program and expected dividend payments, and to meet our debt and pension obligations.\nOn April 3, 2018, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which provides for secured credit facilities, consisting of:\n (a) a $950 million term loan due in 2025, with interest at LIBOR +175 basis points, and \n (b) a $400 million revolving credit facility due in 2023, with interest at LIBOR +175 basis points. \nTOC-Financial Statements\nWe used the proceeds from the term loan to repay in full the outstanding borrowings of $507.0 million under our 2014 credit agreement, to fund the 2018 polyolefin catalysts acquisition for $418.0 million, and to make a voluntary $50.0 million accelerated contribution to our U.S. qualified pension plans. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Credit Agreement.\nCash Resources and Available Credit Facilities\nAt December 31, 2019, we had available liquidity of $700.0 million, consisting of $282.5 million in cash and cash equivalents ($189.1 million in the U.S.), $378.5 million available under our revolving credit facility, and $39.0 million of available liquidity under various non-U.S. credit facilities. The $400 million revolving credit facility includes a $100 million sublimit for letters of credit.\nOur non-U.S. credit facilities are extended to various subsidiaries that use them primarily to issue bank guarantees supporting trade activity and to provide working capital during occasional cash shortfalls. We generally renew these credit facilities as they expire.\nThe following table summarizes our non-U.S. credit facilities as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n(In millions)\n</td> <td>Maximum\nBorrowing\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Available\nLiquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expiration Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>China\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 3, 2023\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Singapore\n</td> <td>18.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 3, 2023\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other countries\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 3, 2023, as well as open-ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnalysis of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>392.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>342.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>319.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>(210.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(618.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(129.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>(99.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>316.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(134.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>81.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period\n</td> <td>201.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents, end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>282.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>201.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $392.1 million compared with $342.0 million in the prior year. The year-over-year change in cash flow is primarily due to higher gross profit in 2019 and the $50.0 million accelerated contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2018, partially offset by lower advance payments from customers compared with 2018.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2018 was $342.0 million compared with $319.2 million in the prior year. The year-over-year change in cash flow was primarily due to higher income from continuing operations and the timing of advance payments from customers in 2018, and a 2017 payment of $30.0 million to satisfy a deferred payment obligation to the asbestos property damage trust required under the joint plan of reorganization, partially offset by a $50.0 million accelerated contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans, higher net cash paid for income taxes, and the prior-year dividend received from ART that did not repeat in 2018.\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2019 was $210.1 million compared with $618.5 million in 2018 and $129.2 million in 2017. Net cash used for investing activities primarily includes the net cash paid for capital expenditures and businesses acquired. In 2018, we completed the purchase of the polyolefin catalysts business of Albemarle Corporation for $418.0 million. Our capital expenditures include investments in new capacity, improved productivity, information technology, and maintenance of our manufacturing and office facilities. We\nTOC-Financial Statements\nexpect our capital expenditures in 2020 to be approximately $195 million and have entered into commitments related to a portion of those expenditures. We expect to fund our capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities.\nNet cash used for financing activities in 2019 was $99.4 million compared with cash provided of $316.5 million in 2018 and cash used of $134.8 million in 2017. Cash paid for repurchases of common stock in 2019 was $29.8 million, compared with $80.0 million in 2018 and $65.0 million in 2017. We paid cash dividends of $72.6 million in 2019, compared with $64.6 million in 2018 and $57.3 million in 2017. In 2018, we entered into the Credit Agreement and used a portion of the proceeds to repay in full the borrowings outstanding under our 2014 credit agreement.\nDebt and Other Contractual Obligations\nTotal debt outstanding at December 31, 2019, was $1,980.4 million.

See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of Financial Assurances.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of Pension Plans and Other Retirement Plans.\nDefined Contribution Retirement Plan\nWe sponsor a defined contribution retirement plan for our employees in the United States. This plan is qualified under section 401(k) of the U.S. tax code. Currently, we contribute an amount equal to 100% of employee contributions, up to 6% of an individual employee's salary or wages. Our costs related to this benefit plan were $13.9 million, $12.6 million and $11.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nU.S. salaried employees and certain U.S. hourly employees hired on or after January 1, 2017, and employees in Germany hired on or after January 1, 2016, participate in enhanced defined contribution plans instead of defined benefit pension plans. For the U.S. plan, we contribute 4% of an individual employee's salary or wages. For the German plan, contributions vary based on the individual employee's contributions and other factors. Our cost related to these enhanced defined contribution plans established in the United States and\nTOC-Financial Statements\nGermany was $3.7 million, $1.9 million, and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We expect these amounts to increase in the future as more employees enroll in these plans.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for our employees in the U.S., Canada, Germany, and a number of other countries, and fund government-sponsored programs in other countries where we operate. Certain of our defined benefit pension plans are advance-funded and others are pay-as-you-go. The advance-funded plans are administered by trustees who receive direction related to the management of plan assets and arrange to have obligations paid when due. Our most significant advance-funded plans cover current and former salaried employees in the U.S. and employees covered by collective bargaining agreements at certain of our U.S. facilities. Our U.S. advance-funded plans are qualified under the U.S. tax code.\nThe following table presents the funded status of our underfunded and unfunded pension plans:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fully-Funded\nPension Plans(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Underfunded\nPension Plans(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unfunded\nPension Plans(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected benefit obligation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,022.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>920.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>448.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>380.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value of plan assets\n</td> <td>44.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>936.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>852.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funded status (PBO basis)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(86.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(67.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(448.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(380.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Plans intended to be advance-funded. \n (2) Plans intended to be pay-as-you-go.  We have both fully-funded and underfunded pension plans. Our fully-funded plans have assets in excess of projected benefit obligation ( PBO\u201d) of $8.5 million at December 31, 2019. Underfunded plans include a group of advance-funded plans that are underfunded on a PBO basis by a total of $86.1 million as of December 31, 2019. Additionally, we have several plans that are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis, and therefore, the entire PBO for these plans of $448.5 million at December 31, 2019, is unfunded. The net funded status of all of these plans was $526.1 million as of December 31, 2019, and is presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows: $8.5 million in other assets,\u201d $14.8 million in other current liabilities,\u201d $434.6 million in unfunded defined benefit pension plans,\u201d and $85.2 million in underfunded defined benefit pension plans.\u201d\nAt the December 31, 2019, measurement date for the U.S. advance-funded plans, the PBO was $1,029.4 million as measured under U.S. GAAP. The PBO is measured as the present value (using a 3.13% weighted average discount rate as of December 31, 2019) of vested and non-vested benefits earned from employee service to date, based upon current services and estimated future pay increases for active employees. Of the participants in the U.S. advance-funded plans, approximately 79% are retired or former employees or employees of our former businesses, which shortens the duration of the PBO. Assets available to fund the PBO for the U.S. advance-funded plans at December 31, 2019, were $955.6 million, or $73.8 million less than the measured obligation.\nThe following table presents the components of cash contributions for the advance-funded and pay-as-you-go plans:\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. advance-funded plans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. pay-as-you-go plans\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-U.S. advance-funded plans\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-U.S. pay-as-you-go plans\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Cash Contributions\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe intend to fund non-U.S. pension plans based upon applicable legal requirements and actuarial and trustee recommendations. We contributed $9.1 million related to these plans in 2019.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nOther Contingencies\nSee Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our other contingent matters.\nInflation\nWe recognize that inflationary pressures may have an adverse effect on us through higher asset replacement costs and higher raw materials and other operating costs. We try to minimize these impacts by developing alternative formulations, increasing productivity, hedging purchases of certain raw materials, and increasing prices.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions affecting the assets and liabilities reported at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the revenues and expenses reported for the periods presented. We believe that our accounting estimates are appropriate and the related balances are reasonable; however, actual amounts could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments in future periods. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which the change is identified. Our accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting estimates are described in this section.\nAn accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions and judgments about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period that could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. As part of our quarterly disclosure controls and procedures, management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nContingent Liabilities\nWe have recorded a liability for the resolution of contingencies related to asbestos property damage, environmental remediation, and litigation. We record a liability if we have determined that a loss is probable and we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or have another reasonable basis for recording a liability. We have determined that each of the contingencies discussed below involves an accounting judgment that is material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLegacy Product Liabilities\nWe emerged from an asbestos-related Chapter 11 bankruptcy on February 3, 2014, as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Under the plan of reorganization, all pending and future asbestos-related claims are channeled for resolution to either the PI Trust or the PD Trust. The trusts are the sole recourse for holders of asbestos-related claims. The channeling injunctions issued by the bankruptcy court prohibit holders of asbestos-related claims from asserting such claims directly against us.\nWe have satisfied all of our financial obligations to the PI Trust. We have contingent financial obligations remaining to the PD Trust. With respect to ZAI PD Claims, the PD Trust was funded with $49.4 million (net of $15 million of attorneys' fees) to pay claims and expenses. We are also obligated to make up to 10 contingent deferred payments of $8 million per year to the PD Trust during the 20-year period beginning on the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date, with each such payment due only if the assets of the PD Trust in respect of ZAI PD Claims fall below $10 million during the preceding year. As of December 31, 2019, the PD Trust has paid out approximately $29 million in ZAI PD Claims and expenses, leaving a balance of approximately $23 million, including the benefit of realized investment gains.\nDue to the limited claims history, the unique nature of this product, and the uncertainty of future claims patterns, an actuarial analysis was completed to estimate the range of possible future payments. The analysis was conducted by a third-party actuarial firm directed by us and using historical claims data provided by the ZAI trustee. Certain key assumptions employed in the analysis were (1) projections of the future number of filed claims, assuming a percentage increase in claims during earlier years and annual decreases in later years; (2) application of historical percentages of claims closed with indemnity payment compared to total closed claims, applied on a regional basis; and (3) application of the average claim payout, which reflects the average indemnity cost per claim closing with payment. As a result of the analysis and taking into account the relative uncertainty of\nTOC-Financial Statements\nfuture claims activity, we determined that contingent funding obligations beyond the next five years are not reasonably estimable. We estimate that the reasonable range of payments over the next five years is expected to be between $16 million and $24 million and project that the first payment could be due in 2022. In the 2019 fourth quarter, we recorded a reserve in the amount of $24.0 million related to probable future obligations to fund the PD Trust for ZAI PD Claims. Our maximum financial obligation over the next 19 years is $80.0 million, and no single year's obligation can exceed $8.0 million.\nWith respect to Other PD Claims, claims unresolved as of the Effective Date are to be litigated in the bankruptcy court and any future claims are to be litigated in a federal district court, in each case pursuant to procedures approved by the bankruptcy court. To the extent any such Other PD Claims are determined to be allowed claims, they are to be paid in cash by the PD Trust. We are obligated to make a payment to the PD Trust every six months in the amount of any Other PD Claims allowed during the preceding six months plus interest (if applicable) and the amount of PD Trust expenses for the preceding six months. We have not paid any Other PD Claims since emergence. Annual expenses have been approximately $0.2 million per year. The aggregate amount to be paid under the PD Obligation is not capped, and we may be obligated to make additional payments to the PD Trust in respect of the PD Obligation. We have accrued for those unresolved Other PD Claims that we believe are probable and estimable. We have not accrued for other unresolved or unasserted Other PD Claims as we do not believe that payment is probable.\nAll payments to the PD Trust required after the Effective Date are secured by our obligation to issue 77,372,257 shares of Company common stock to the PD Trust in the event of default, subject to customary anti-dilution provisions.\nEnvironmental Remediation\nWe are obligated under applicable law to remediate certain properties related to our business or former businesses. At some sites we outsource all or a portion of the remediation to third parties, and at others we perform the required remediation ourselves. Our environmental remediation obligation has a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. See disclosure in this Report in Item 1 (Business-Environment, Health and Safety Matters) and in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our environmental remediation liabilities.\nAt sites where third parties conduct remediation, we estimate our obligations from information available to us from these third parties and other consultants, including actual costs incurred, expected future costs and time to completion. At sites where we conduct remediation, we work with regulatory authorities to define compliance requirements and then estimate the cost required to meet those requirements with information available to us. We base our estimates on our historical knowledge and engineering assessments specific to conditions at each site, and we update our estimates as necessary.\nOur estimates can fluctuate significantly due to the extended duration of some remediation projects. The accuracy of our estimates is dependent on the validity of assumptions regarding regulatory approaches and such matters as labor rates, indirect costs and capital costs, which are each difficult to forecast over extended periods. Future changes in estimates, if required, may lead to material adjustments to our Consolidated Financial Statements, and the ultimate resolution of these obligations could have a material impact on our liquidity and capital resources.\nWe purchased a vermiculite mine in Libby, Montana, in 1963 and operated it until 1990. Vermiculite concentrate from the Libby mine was used in the manufacture of attic insulation and other products. Some of the vermiculite ore contained naturally occurring asbestos. We are engaged with the EPA and other federal, state and local governmental agencies in a remedial investigation and feasibility study of the Libby mine and the surrounding area, known as OU3. The RI/FS will determine the specific areas within OU3 requiring remediation and will identify possible remedial action alternatives. Possible remedial actions within OU3 are wide-ranging, from institutional controls such as land use restrictions, to more active measures involving soil removal, containment projects, or other protective measures.\nAs part of the RI/FS process, we contracted an engineering and consulting firm to develop a range of possible remedial alternatives and associated cost estimates for OU3. Based on this work, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $70.0 million in the 2018 third quarter for the estimated costs of remediation of OU3. We believe that\nTOC-Financial Statements\nthis amount should provide for a protective remedy meeting the statutory requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act.\nThe estimated costs of remediation are preliminary and consist of several components, each of which may vary significantly as the remedial alternatives are further developed. It is reasonably possible that the ultimate costs of remediation could range between $30 million and $170 million. We are working closely with the EPA, and the ultimate remedy will be determined by the EPA after the RI/FS is finalized. Such remedy will be set forth in a ROD that is currently expected to be issued by the EPA no earlier than 2021. Costs associated with the more active remedial alternatives would be expected to be incurred over a decade or more. We will reevaluate our estimated liability as remedial alternatives evolve based on further work by the engineering and consulting firm and discussions with the EPA as the RI/FS process moves toward a ROD. Technical memoranda expected prior to the issuance of the ROD may provide insight into the likely remedial alternatives ultimately selected, allowing us to update our cost of remediation estimate. Depending on the remedial alternatives that the EPA selects in the ROD, the total cost of remediating OU3 may exceed our current estimate by material amounts.\nWe have cooperated with the EPA in investigating and remediating a number of formerly owned or operated sites that processed Libby vermiculite into finished products. We have recorded a liability for remaining expected EPA response and oversight costs, and for potential future site remediation, where a review has indicated that liability is probable and the cost is estimable. The EPA may commence additional investigations in the future at other sites that processed Libby vermiculite. Liability for unaccrued additional investigation and remediation costs is probable but not yet estimable, and could be material.\nOther Legacy Liabilities\nOn April 3, 2019, the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation issued a five-year operating permit for a dam at the Libby mine site. We constructed the dam in 1971 to prevent vermiculite ore tailings from moving into nearby creeks and rivers. The permit requires us to complete construction of a new spillway before the permit is further renewed in five years. We contracted a third-party engineering and consulting firm to develop a range of cost estimates for the project. Based on this work we recorded pre-tax charges of $68.0 million in 2019 for the estimated costs of the project. These costs are preliminary and may vary significantly as the project progresses. Based on the consultants' estimates, we believe it is reasonably possible that the ultimate costs of this project could range between $50 million and $100 million. Construction of the new spillway is expected to take three to four years.\nLitigation\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business. To estimate the cost to resolve our legal obligations, we review the facts of each matter to determine the merits of the case and the corresponding probability of a loss. If we determine that a loss is probable, we determine if there is sufficient information to make a reasonable estimate of the loss amount. Our estimates regarding the outcome of our legal proceedings and claims involve substantial uncertainties that could cause our actual losses to differ materially from our estimates. In estimating the likely outcome of a legal proceeding, we consider the nature of the specific claim (or unasserted claim), our experience with similar claims, the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is filed, court rulings, the status of any settlement negotiations, the likelihood of resolution through settlement or alternative dispute resolution, the proceeding's current status and other relevant information and events. We adjust our recorded liability for litigation contingencies as necessary to reflect our current evaluation of these and other factors.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to allocate the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations.\u201d The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded to goodwill. The assessment of fair value requires management to make significant estimates, including future expected revenues, earnings, and cash flows; expected useful lives; and attrition and discount rates. The allocation of the purchase price may be adjusted during the measurement period, which may not exceed one year after the acquisition date.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nWe review our finite-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. We have no indefinite-lived intangible assets. There were no impairment charges recorded in any of the periods presented.\nWe review our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at October 31 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. We have identified our operating segments as reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Our Catalysts Technologies reportable segment has two reporting units for goodwill impairment testing, which are our Refining Technologies and Specialty Catalysts operating segments. Our Materials Technologies operating segment represents a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing.\nWe performed a qualitative analysis as of October 31, 2019, and concluded that the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values.\nPension Expenses and Liabilities\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for our employees in the United States and a number of other countries, including Canada and Germany, and fund government-sponsored programs in other countries where we operate. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of our pension plans.\nIn order to estimate our pension expenses and liabilities we evaluate the range of possible assumptions to be used in the calculation of pension expenses and liabilities. We select the assumptions that we believe to be most indicative of factors such as participant demographics, past experiences and market indices, and provide the assumptions to independent actuaries. These assumptions are updated annually and primarily include factors such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, retirement rates, and rate of compensation increase. The independent actuaries review our assumptions for reasonableness, and use the assumptions to calculate our estimated liability and future pension expense. We review the actuarial reports for reasonableness and adjust our expenses, assets and liabilities to reflect the amounts calculated in the actuarial reports.\nOur method of accounting for actuarial gains and losses relating to its global defined benefit pension plans is referred to as mark-to-market accounting.\u201d Under mark-to-market accounting, our pension costs consist of two elements: (1) ongoing costs recognized quarterly, which include service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service costs/credits; and (2) mark-to-market gains and losses recognized annually in the fourth quarter resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets. Should a significant event occur, our pension obligation and plan assets are remeasured at an interim period, and the gains or losses on remeasurement are recognized in that period.\nThe two key assumptions used in determining our ongoing quarterly pension expense (excluding the effects of the annual mark-to-market adjustment) are the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. Our most significant pension assets and pension liabilities relate to U.S. pension plans.\nThe assumed discount rate for pension plans reflects the market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available and is subject to change based on changes in overall market interest rates. For the U.S. pension plans, the assumed weighted average discount rate was selected in consultation with our independent actuaries, based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan.\nWe selected the expected return on plan assets for the U.S. qualified pension plans for 2019 in consultation with our independent actuaries, using an expected return model. The model determines the weighted average return for an investment portfolio based on the target asset allocation and expected future returns for each asset class, which were developed using a building block approach based on observable inflation, available interest rate information, current market characteristics, and historical results.\nThe following table reflects the sensitivity of 2020 pre-tax expense (excluding the effects of the annual mark-to-market adjustment) and our year-end PBO to a change in the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets assumptions for the U.S. pension plans:\nTOC-Financial Statements\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in Assumption\n(In millions)\n</td> <td>Effect on 2020\nPre-Tax Pension\nExpense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect on December 31, 2019 PBO\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 basis point decrease in discount rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 basis point increase in discount rate\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 basis point decrease in expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 basis point increase in expected return on plan assets\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is primarily determined based on our pre-tax income and the statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The effective tax rate also reflects the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax returns, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets are also recorded for NOL and federal tax credit carryforwards.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized by applying enacted tax rates to temporary differences that exist as of the balance sheet date. We reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. The need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed quarterly. In assessing the requirement for, and amount of, a valuation allowance in accordance with the more likely than not standard, we give appropriate consideration to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability and foreign source income ( FSI\u201d), the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforward expirations. A history of cumulative losses is a significant piece of negative evidence used in our assessment. If a history of cumulative losses is incurred for a tax jurisdiction, forecasts of future profitability are not used as positive evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets in the assessment.\nOur net deferred income tax assets (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) as of December 31, 2019, include deferred U.S. federal income tax assets representing federal tax credit carryforwards of $294.7 million and federal NOL carryforwards of $1.2 million, state NOL deferred income tax assets of $51.3 million, and foreign NOL deferred tax assets of $9.6 million. We have established valuation allowances in the amount of $24.1 million, consisting of $10.1 million for state NOL carryforwards, $13.8 million for foreign deferred tax assets, primarily foreign operating loss carryforwards, and $0.2 million for federal NOL carryforwards.\nThe federal tax credit carryforwards arose primarily as a result of the payment of intercompany dividends from our foreign affiliates, from the mandatory repatriation under the TCJA, and from research and development credits. The state NOLs arose primarily as a result of the amounts paid as a result of our bankruptcy proceedings.\nIn order to fully utilize our U.S. federal tax credits before they expire from 2021 to 2039, we will need to generate income of approximately $1.4 billion. We will need to generate approximately $2.5 billion for state income tax purposes during the respective realization periods (ranging from 2020 to 2036) in order to fully realize the state NOLs.\nInherent in determining our effective tax rate are judgments regarding business plans and expectations about future operations. These judgments include the amount and geographic mix of future taxable income, the amount of FSI, limitations on the usage of NOL carryforwards, the impact of ongoing or potential tax audits, and other future tax consequences.\nOur ability to utilize deferred tax assets may be impacted by certain future events, such as changes in tax legislation or insufficient future taxable income or FSI prior to expiration of certain deferred tax assets.\nWe recognize the tax benefits of an uncertain tax position if those benefits are more likely than not to be sustained based on existing tax law. Additionally, we establish a reserve for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained based on existing tax law, if the ultimate benefit to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities is uncertain. Unrecognized tax benefits are subsequently recognized at the time the\nTOC-Financial Statements\nmore likely than not recognition threshold is met, the tax matter is effectively settled or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine and challenge the tax position has expired, whichever is earlier.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their effect on us.\nTOC-Financial Statements", "item_7_text": "Item 7.

See Item 1 (Business-Business Overview) of this Report for a summary description of our business.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nAnalysis of Operations\nWe have set forth in the table below our key operating statistics with percentage changes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. Please refer to this Analysis of Operations when reviewing this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In the table we present financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as well as the non-GAAP financial information described below. We believe that the non-GAAP financial information provides useful supplemental information about the performance of our businesses, improves period-to-period comparability and provides clarity on the information our management uses to evaluate the performance of our businesses. In the table, we have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and reconciliations from those results should be evaluated carefully.\nWe define Adjusted EBIT (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be net income attributable to W. R. Grace & Co. shareholders adjusted for interest income and expense; income taxes; costs related to legacy matters; restructuring and repositioning expenses and asset impairments; pension costs other than service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service costs/credits; gains and losses on sales and exits of businesses, product lines, and certain other investments; third-party acquisition-related costs and the amortization of acquired inventory fair value adjustment; and certain other items that are not representative of underlying trends.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be Adjusted EBIT adjusted for depreciation and amortization.\nWe define Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be Adjusted EBIT (on a trailing four quarters basis) divided by Adjusted Invested Capital, which is defined as equity adjusted for debt; underfunded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans; liabilities related to legacy matters; cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash; net income tax assets; and certain other assets and liabilities. We have modified the presentation of this financial measure to reconcile to return on equity.\nWe define Adjusted Gross Margin (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be gross margin adjusted for pension-related costs included in cost of goods sold, the amortization of acquired inventory fair value adjustment, and write-offs of inventory related to exits of businesses and product lines.\nWe define Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be diluted EPS adjusted for costs related to legacy matters; restructuring and repositioning expenses and asset impairments; pension costs other than service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service costs/credits; gains and losses on sales and exits of businesses, product lines and certain other investments; third-party acquisition-related costs and the amortization of acquired inventory fair value adjustment; certain other items that are not representative of underlying trends; certain discrete tax items; and income tax expense related to historical tax attributes.\nWe define Net Sales, constant currency (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be the period-over-period change in net sales calculated using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period.\nLegacy matters\u201d include legacy (i) product, (ii) environmental, and (iii) other liabilities, relating to past activities of Grace.\nWe use Adjusted EBIT as a performance measure in significant business decisions and in determining certain incentive compensation. We use Adjusted EBIT as a performance measure because it provides improved period-to-period comparability for decision making and compensation purposes, and because it better measures the ongoing earnings results of our strategic and operating decisions by excluding the earnings effects of our legacy matters; restructuring and repositioning activities; certain acquisition-related items; and certain other items that are not representative of underlying trends.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital, Adjusted Gross Margin, and Adjusted EPS as performance measures and may use these measures in determining certain incentive compensation. We\nTOC-Financial Statements\nuse Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital in making operating and investment decisions and in balancing the growth and profitability of our operations.\nWe use Net Sales, constant currency as a performance measure to compare current period financial performance to historical financial performance by excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are not representative of underlying business trends and are largely outside of our control.\nAdjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EPS, and Net Sales, constant currency are non-GAAP financial measures; do not purport to represent income measures as defined under U.S. GAAP; and should not be used as alternatives to such measures as an indicator of our performance. These measures are provided to investors and others to improve the period-to-period comparability and peer-to-peer comparability of our financial results, and to ensure that investors understand the information we use to evaluate the performance of our businesses. They distinguish the operating results of Grace's current business base from the costs of Grace's legacy matters; restructuring and repositioning activities; and certain other items. These measures may have material limitations due to the exclusion or inclusion of amounts that are included or excluded, respectively, in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and thus investors and others should review carefully our financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nAdjusted EBIT has material limitations as an operating performance measure because it excludes costs related to legacy matters, and may exclude income and expenses from restructuring, repositioning, and other activities, which historically have been material components of our net income. Adjusted EBITDA also has material limitations as an operating performance measure because it excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense. Our business is substantially dependent on the successful deployment of capital, and depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs. We compensate for the limitations of these measurements by using these indicators together with net income as measured under U.S. GAAP to present a complete analysis of our results of operations. Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated together with net income and net income attributable to Grace shareholders, measured under U.S. GAAP, for a complete understanding of our results of operations.\nTOC-Financial Statements\n\nTOC-Financial Statements\n\nTOC-Financial Statements\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\nNM-Not Meaningful\n (A) Grace's segment operating income includes only Grace's share of income of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. \n (B) Certain pension costs include only ongoing costs recognized quarterly, which include service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service costs/credits. Catalysts Technologies and Materials Technologies segment operating income and corporate costs do not include any amounts for pension expense. Other pension-related costs including annual mark-to-market (MTM) adjustments and actuarial gains and losses are excluded from Adjusted EBIT. These amounts are not used by management to evaluate the performance of Grace's businesses and significantly affect the peer-to-peer and period-to-period comparability of our financial results. Mark-to-market adjustments and actuarial gains and losses relate primarily to changes in financial market values and actuarial assumptions and are not directly related to the operation of Grace's businesses. \n (C) Defined benefit pension expense\u201d as measured under U.S. GAAP includes actuarial gains and losses and actual returns on assets. Adjusted EBIT includes expected returns on assets but excludes both actuarial gains and losses and actual returns on assets. The table below presents expected and actual returns on plan assets for U.S. and non-U.S. plans for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. \n\n(D)In June 2019, we idled our methanol-to-olefins ( MTO\u201d) manufacturing facility in China.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nGrace Overview\nFollowing is an overview of our financial performance for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nDiscrete Items Impacting 2019\nFour discrete items (the Discrete Items\u201d) impacted 2019 full-year results:\n \u2022 Refining Technologies: an FCC catalysts customer's bankruptcy following a fire resulting in the closure of its refinery;  \u2022Specialty Catalysts: a customer-specific inventory correction in the second half of 2019;\n \u2022 Specialty Catalysts: customer-specific temporary reductions in operating rates and catalyst usage due to reduced feedstock supply following an attack in the Middle East; and \n \u2022 Materials Technologies: an equipment failure in one of our silicas manufacturing lines (operations fully restored by mid-July).  These Discrete Items reduced 2019 full-year net sales by approximately $36 million. These Discrete Items also reduced pretax income and Adjusted EBIT by approximately $36 million. The earnings effect includes lost margin on lower sales, the costs of adjusting our manufacturing operations in response to lower demand, costs incurred to serve customers and minimize any impact to their operations, and costs related to the FCC catalysts customer bankruptcy. These effects were partially mitigated by an approximately $12 million benefit from cost-reduction activities in response to these events and $8 million of business interruption proceeds from the FCC catalyst customer event, resulting in a net reduction to pretax income of approximately $16 million.\nNet Sales and Gross Margin\nSales for 2019 increased 1.3% overall compared with the prior year, up 3.0% on constant currency. The increase was driven by improved pricing in both segments and all regions. Higher sales volumes in Catalysts Technologies were driven by Specialty Catalysts growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific and the 2018 second quarter polyolefin catalysts acquisition, partially offset by the Discrete Items. Sales volumes in Materials Technologies were up driven by growth in the Americas, partially offset by a decline in Asia Pacific and EMEA.\nGross margin increased 80 basis points to 40.5% from 39.7% for the prior year. Adjusted Gross Margin increased 70 basis points to 41.4% from 40.7% for the prior year. Improved pricing, higher sales volumes, favorable mix, and lower depreciation were partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, including a 20 basis point impact related to higher raw materials and energy costs.\nSales for 2018 increased 12.6% overall compared with the prior year, up 11.4% on constant currency. Higher sales volumes in Catalysts Technologies were driven by the polyolefin catalysts acquisition and growth across all regions except Asia. Sales volumes in Materials Technologies were up driven by growth in Europe, North America, and Latin America.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nGross margin increased 30 basis points to 39.7% from 39.4% for the prior year. Adjusted Gross Margin increased 60 basis points to 40.7% from 40.1% for the prior year. The increases were primarily due to lower depreciation expense, improved pricing, higher sales volumes, and favorable product and regional mix, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs including a 170 basis point impact related to higher raw materials and energy costs.\nThe following tables identify the year-over-year increase or decrease in sales attributable to changes in sales volume and/or mix, product price, and the impact of currency translation.\n\n\nGrace Net Income\nNet income attributable to Grace was $126.3 million for 2019 compared with $167.6 million for the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a loss recorded for the annual pension mark-to-market adjustment and higher costs related to legacy matters, including charges of $68.0 million for the estimated costs of construction of a new dam spillway at our former vermiculite mine site and $24.0 million related to probable future payments with\nTOC-Financial Statements\nrespect to our former ZAI product (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by lower restructuring and repositioning expenses, higher operating income from our Catalysts Technologies segment, and a lower provision for income taxes.\nNet income attributable to Grace was $167.6 million for 2018 compared with $11.2 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the $143.0 million provisional tax charge for the estimated impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA\u201d), which was recorded in 2017. This was partially offset by higher restructuring and repositioning expenses and a higher provision for environmental remediation in 2018, which was primarily due to the $70.0 million charge for the estimated costs of future remediation-related activities at the Libby, Montana, mine site and surrounding area (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nIn 2018, we completed a study to evaluate the useful lives of our operating machinery and equipment, including a review of historical asset retirement data as well as review and analysis of relevant industry practices. As a result of this study, effective January 1, 2018, we revised the accounting useful lives of certain machinery and equipment, which was determined to be a change in accounting estimate and was applied prospectively. As a result of this change in accounting estimate, depreciation expense with respect to such machinery and equipment was reduced by $23.5 million, resulting in an increase to net income of $18.0 million or $0.27 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018. Estimated useful lives for operating machinery and equipment, which previously ranged from 3 to 10 years, now range from 5 to 25 years.\nAdjusted EBIT\nAdjusted EBIT was $473.2 million for 2019, an increase of 3.6% compared with the prior year primarily due to higher sales and gross profit including the 2019 first quarter benefit of the polyolefin catalysts acquisition, partially offset by the net impact of the Discrete Items, lower income from our ART joint venture, and unfavorable currency transaction effects.\nAdjusted EBIT was $456.7 million for 2018, an increase of 10.3% compared with the prior year primarily due to higher gross profit including the effect of the polyolefin catalysts acquisition, higher income from our ART joint venture, and favorable currency translation, partially offset by business interruption insurance recoveries in the prior year that did not repeat in 2018 and higher operating expenses.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nAdjusted EPS\nThe following table reconciles our Diluted EPS (GAAP) to our Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP):\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Our historical tax attribute carryforwards (net operating losses and tax credits) unfavorably affected our tax expense with respect to certain provisions of the TCJA. To normalize the effective tax rate, an adjustment was made to eliminate the tax expense impact associated with the historical tax attributes. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Our historical tax attribute carryforwards (net operating losses and tax credits) unfavorably affected our tax expense with respect to certain provisions of the TCJA. To normalize the effective tax rate, an adjustment was made to eliminate the tax expense impact associated with the historical tax attributes. \n\nTOC-Financial Statements\nReturn on Equity and Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital\nReturn on equity for 2019 was 31.4% on a trailing four quarters basis, compared with 49.7% and 4.3% for 2018 and 2017, respectively, on the same basis. Net income for 2019 reflects a charge related to mark-to-market pension accounting, compared with income related to mark-to-market pension accounting in 2018. Net income for 2017 includes charges related to the TCJA and mark-to-market pension accounting.\nAdjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital for 2019 was 20.2% on a trailing four quarters basis, compared with 20.9% and 24.4% for 2018 and 2017, respectively, on the same basis. The decline from 2018 is primarily due to increased growth capital investments that have not yet been placed into service. These assets are expected to be placed in service beginning in 2020 and will support volume growth over the next few years. The decline from 2017 is primarily due to the polyolefin catalysts acquisition, which was completed on April 3, 2018, and increased invested capital at that date.\nWe manage our businesses with the objective of maximizing sales, earnings and cash flow over time. Doing so requires that we successfully balance our growth, profitability and working capital and other investments to support sustainable, long-term financial performance. We use Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital as a performance measure in evaluating operating results, in making operating and investment decisions, and in balancing the growth and profitability of our businesses.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nSegment Overview-Grace Catalysts Technologies\nFollowing is an overview of the financial performance of Catalysts Technologies for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nNet Sales-Grace Catalysts Technologies\nSales were up 2.3% in 2019, or up 3.4% on constant currency, compared with the prior year. The increase on a constant currency basis was due to improved pricing in all regions and higher sales volumes, partially offset by lower sales volumes from the Discrete Items. The improved pricing in both Refining Technologies and Specialty Catalysts was driven by our focused value-selling efforts. For the trailing 12 months ending December 31, 2019, FCC pricing was up over 200 basis points. Higher sales volumes in Catalysts Technologies were driven by Specialty Catalysts growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific and the 2018 second quarter polyolefin catalysts acquisition, partially offset by lower volumes from the Discrete Items. We are actively working to replace the lost sales volume from the FCC catalysts customer refinery closure, but do not expect to commercialize that volume before late 2020 or 2021. In 2019, we announced 6 new UNIPOL\u00ae polypropylene process technology licenses totaling approximately 2,500 kilotons of annual resin capacity, which will continue to drive long-term catalysts and donor sales. Unfavorable currency translation affected both product groups as the U.S. dollar strengthened, primarily against the euro, compared with the prior-year period.\nGross profit was $641.3 million for 2019, an increase of 5.1% compared with the prior year. Gross margin was 42.8% compared with 41.7% for the prior year. The increases were primarily due to improved pricing, favorable mix, higher sales volumes, and lower depreciation, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs including a 10 basis point impact related to higher raw materials and energy costs and the Discrete Items.\nSales were up 14.6% in 2018, or up 13.7% on constant currency, compared with the prior year. The increase on a constant currency basis was due to higher sales volumes and improved pricing. Higher sales were driven by the 2018 polyolefin catalysts acquisition and growth across all regions except Asia, driven by higher demand from new and existing customers and higher licensing revenues. Favorable currency translation affected both product groups as the U.S. dollar weakened against multiple currencies, especially the euro, compared with the prior year.\nGross profit was $610.0 million for 2018, an increase of 17.0% compared with the prior year. Gross margin was 41.7% compared with 40.8% for the prior year. The increases were primarily due to lower depreciation expense, higher sales volumes, improved pricing, and favorable product and regional mix, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs including a 180 basis point impact related to higher raw materials and energy costs.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nSegment Operating Income (SOI) and Margin-Grace Catalysts Technologies\nSegment operating income was $466.5 million for 2019, an increase of 5.9% compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher sales and gross profit, and business interruption insurance recoveries, partially offset by lower income from our ART joint venture, higher operating expenses including from the polyolefin catalysts acquisition, unfavorable effects of currency exchange rates, and higher amortization. The ART joint venture contributed $27.8 million to operating income, a decrease of $4.0 million from the prior-year period primarily due to an increase in expenses charged to the joint venture by the partners. Segment operating margin for 2019 increased to 31.2%, an improvement of 110 basis points compared with the prior year.\nIn June 2019, a Catalysts Technologies customer experienced a fire resulting in its refinery closure and subsequent bankruptcy. Lost earnings from this Discrete Item in 2019 were approximately $14 million. We recognized a benefit of and received $8.0 million in payments from our third-party insurer during the 2019 fourth quarter under our business interruption insurance policy for a portion of profits lost in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 as a result of the closure. We expect to receive additional insurance recoveries related to this event in 2020. The policy has a $25.0 million limit for this event.\nSegment operating income was $440.5 million for 2018, an increase of 11.4% compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher gross profit, higher income from our ART joint venture, and favorable currency translation. The increase was partially offset by the absence of business interruption insurance recoveries that were included in the prior year and higher operating expenses. The ART joint venture contributed $31.8 million to operating income, an increase of $5.9 million from the prior-year period. Segment operating margin for 2018 decreased to 30.1%, a decline of 90 basis points compared with the prior year, primarily due to the absence of business interruption insurance recoveries.\nIn January 2017, a Catalysts Technologies customer experienced a fire resulting in an extended outage. We recognized a benefit of and received $25.0 million in payments from our third-party insurer during 2017 under our business interruption insurance policy for a portion of profits lost as a result of the outage. The policy had a $25.0 million limit for this event.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nSegment Overview-Grace Materials Technologies\nFollowing is an overview of the financial performance of Materials Technologies for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nNet Sales-Grace Materials Technologies\nSales were down 1.5% in 2019, or up 2.2% on constant currency, compared with the prior year. The increase on a constant currency basis was due to improved pricing and higher sales volumes, partially offset by lower sales volumes from one of the Discrete Items. Pricing improved across all regions, driven by EMEA and the Americas. The increase in sales volumes was primarily driven by higher consumer/pharma sales in all regions, partially offset by lower coatings sales in Asia, EMEA, and North America. The pricing improvement and increased sales volumes were more than offset by unfavorable currency translation as the U.S. dollar strengthened, primarily against the euro, compared with the prior-year period. Our Materials Technologies business segment is particularly sensitive to changes in the euro.\nGross profit was $168.6 million for 2019, a decrease of 4.7% compared with the prior year. Gross margin was 36.5% compared with 37.8% for the prior year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher manufacturing costs including costs directly related to one of the Discrete Items and 50 basis points related to higher raw materials and energy costs, partially offset by improved pricing and lower depreciation expense.\nSales were up 6.5% in 2018, or up 4.7% on constant currency, compared with the prior year. The increase on a constant currency basis was due to higher sales volumes and improved pricing. The increase in sales volumes was primarily driven by higher consumer/pharma and coatings sales in Europe, higher chemical process and coatings sales in North America, and higher sales across all product groups in Latin America. The remainder of the increase was driven by improved pricing across all regions and favorable currency translation as the U.S. dollar weakened against multiple currencies, especially the euro, compared with the prior year.\nGross profit was $177.0 million for 2018, an increase of 6.1% compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher sales volumes and favorable product and regional mix, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. Gross margin was 37.8% compared with 37.9% for the prior year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher manufacturing costs including a 120 basis point impact related to higher raw materials and energy costs, partially offset by favorable product and regional mix, improved pricing, and lower depreciation expense.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nSegment Operating Income (SOI) and Margin-Grace Materials Technologies\nSegment operating income was $97.8 million for 2019, a decrease of 7.4% compared with the prior year, primarily due to lower gross profit and higher operating expenses, including the effects of one of the Discrete Items. Segment operating margin for 2019 decreased to 21.2%, a decline of 130 basis points compared with the prior year.\nSegment operating income was $105.6 million for 2018, an increase of 5.0% compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Segment operating margin for 2018 decreased to 22.5%, a decline of 40 basis points compared with the prior year.\nCorporate Overview\nCorporate costs include functional and other costs such as professional fees, incentive compensation, and insurance premiums. Corporate costs for 2019 decreased 1.1% compared with the prior year, primarily due to lower accruals for incentive compensation, partially offset by higher employee-related costs.\nCorporate costs for 2018 increased 6.5% compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense.\nRestructuring and Repositioning Expenses\nDuring 2019, we incurred $2.6 million of restructuring expenses primarily related to severance costs pertaining to the idling of our methanol-to-olefins ( MTO\u201d) manufacturing facility in China, which were substantially paid in 2019. Restructuring expenses of $14.0 million in 2018 primarily related to the closure of two smaller\nTOC-Financial Statements\nmanufacturing plants, the activities from which have been moved to larger, more cost-effective plants as part of our strategy to capture synergies from our recent catalysts acquisitions. Restructuring expenses of $11.5 million in 2017 primarily related to workforce reduction programs in Grace's manufacturing, supply chain, finance and IT functions. Substantially all costs related to the restructuring programs are expected to be paid by December 31, 2021, but could be paid earlier subject to negotiations around certain plant exit costs.\nRepositioning expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $11.1 million, $32.4 million, and $15.2 million respectively. Expenses incurred in 2019 and 2018 related to a multi-year program to transform manufacturing and business processes to extend our competitive advantages and improve our cost position. Expenses in 2018 also included $11.7 million of severance and stock compensation costs related to employee separations, and write-offs of $8.5 million of previously capitalized plant engineering costs as a result of terminating an expansion project no longer necessary due to the polyolefin catalysts acquisition (see Note 20). Expenses incurred in 2017 primarily related to third-party costs associated with productivity and transformation initiatives, as well as costs related to the Separation. Excluding asset write-offs and stock compensation costs, substantially all of these costs have been or are expected to be settled in cash.\nThe following table presents the major components of restructuring and repositioning expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\n\nDefined Benefit Pension Expense\nDefined benefit pension expense includes costs under U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans that provide benefits to business segment and corporate employees, as well as retirees and former employees of divested businesses where we retained these obligations.\nUnder mark-to-market accounting, our pension costs consist of two elements: (1) certain pension costs\u201d-ongoing costs recognized quarterly, which include service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service costs/credits; and (2) pension mark-to-market adjustment and other related costs, net\u201d-mark-to-market gains and losses recognized annually in the fourth quarter, or at an interim period should a significant event occur, resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets.\nCertain pension costs were $18.4 million, $15.9 million and $13.0 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in discount rates. The increase from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in expected return on assets, partially offset by a decrease in service cost and interest cost due to an increase in discount rates.\nPension mark-to-market adjustment and other related costs, net were $85.9 million, $(15.2) million and $51.1 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These costs are reported in other (income) expense, net\u201d in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2019 mark-to-market pension expense of $85.9 million was primarily due to the decrease in discount rates used to value the projected benefit obligations of our plans from year-end 2018 to year-end 2019, partially offset by higher than expected return on assets. The 2018 mark-to-market pension income of $15.2 million was primarily due to the increase in discount rates used to value the projected benefit obligations of our plans from year-end 2017 to year-end 2018, partially offset by lower than expected return on assets. The 2017 mark-to-market pension expense of $51.1 million was primarily due to the decrease in discount rates used to value the projected benefit obligations of our plans from year-end 2016 to year-end 2017, partially offset by higher than expected return on assets in the U.S.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nInterest and Financing Expenses\nNet interest and financing expenses were $74.8 million for 2019, a 4.7% decrease compared with 2018 primarily due to higher capitalized interest in 2019 related primarily to the growth capital investments. Interest and financing expenses were $78.5 million for 2018, flat compared with 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense (benefit) for 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $56.8 million, $78.1 million and $200.5 million, respectively, on income before income taxes of $183.5 million, $244.9 million and $210.9 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOur 2019 effective tax rate of 31.0% was higher than the 21% U.S. statutory rate. The higher rate was primarily caused by U.S. taxes on foreign earnings and an increase to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by U.S. federal research and development tax credits and the release of certain U.S. liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the utilization of our U.S. federal NOLs, our 2019 effective tax rate reflects a benefit associated with the GILTI deduction, which was not available in the prior year.\nOur 2018 effective tax rate of 31.9% also was higher than the 21% U.S. statutory rate. The higher rate was primarily caused by recognition of the GILTI tax that could not be offset with a corresponding GILTI deduction due to our utilization of federal NOLs in 2018. The geographic mix of income also contributed to the higher rate since the statutory rates in effect for our foreign subsidiaries exceed the 21% U.S. statutory rate.\nOur 2017 effective tax rate includes $143.0 million in charges related to the TCJA. The effective tax rate without the impact of the TCJA would have been 27.3%, lower than the 35% U.S. statutory rate, primarily due to the geographic mix of income and U.S. federal research and development tax credits.\nSee Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources\nFollowing is an analysis of our financial condition, liquidity and capital resources at December 31, 2019.\nOur principal uses of cash are generally capital investments and acquisitions; working capital investments; compensation paid to employees, including contributions to our defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans; the repayment of debt and interest payments thereon; and the return of cash to shareholders through the repurchase of shares and the payment of dividends.\nOn February 8, 2017, we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program of up to $250 million. During the first half of 2019 we repurchased 409,769 shares of Company common stock for $29.8 million. During the second half of 2019, we did not repurchase Company common stock under this program as we prioritized de-leveraging at this time with a focus on lowering our leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2019, $109.1 million remained under the current authorization.\nWe paid cash dividends of $72.6 million during 2019. On February 7, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved an increase in the annual dividend rate, from $0.96 to $1.08 per share of Company common stock, effective with the dividend paid March 21, 2019. On February 4, 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a further increase to $1.20 per share of Company common stock, effective with the dividend to be paid March 17, 2020.\nWe believe that the cash we expect to generate during 2020 and thereafter, together with other available liquidity and capital resources, are sufficient to finance our operations, growth strategy, share repurchase program and expected dividend payments, and to meet our debt and pension obligations.\nOn April 3, 2018, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which provides for secured credit facilities, consisting of:\n (a) a $950 million term loan due in 2025, with interest at LIBOR +175 basis points, and \n (b) a $400 million revolving credit facility due in 2023, with interest at LIBOR +175 basis points. \nTOC-Financial Statements\nWe used the proceeds from the term loan to repay in full the outstanding borrowings of $507.0 million under our 2014 credit agreement, to fund the 2018 polyolefin catalysts acquisition for $418.0 million, and to make a voluntary $50.0 million accelerated contribution to our U.S. qualified pension plans. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Credit Agreement.\nCash Resources and Available Credit Facilities\nAt December 31, 2019, we had available liquidity of $700.0 million, consisting of $282.5 million in cash and cash equivalents ($189.1 million in the U.S.), $378.5 million available under our revolving credit facility, and $39.0 million of available liquidity under various non-U.S. credit facilities. The $400 million revolving credit facility includes a $100 million sublimit for letters of credit.\nOur non-U.S. credit facilities are extended to various subsidiaries that use them primarily to issue bank guarantees supporting trade activity and to provide working capital during occasional cash shortfalls. We generally renew these credit facilities as they expire.\nThe following table summarizes our non-U.S. credit facilities as of December 31, 2019:\n\nAnalysis of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $392.1 million compared with $342.0 million in the prior year. The year-over-year change in cash flow is primarily due to higher gross profit in 2019 and the $50.0 million accelerated contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2018, partially offset by lower advance payments from customers compared with 2018.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2018 was $342.0 million compared with $319.2 million in the prior year. The year-over-year change in cash flow was primarily due to higher income from continuing operations and the timing of advance payments from customers in 2018, and a 2017 payment of $30.0 million to satisfy a deferred payment obligation to the asbestos property damage trust required under the joint plan of reorganization, partially offset by a $50.0 million accelerated contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans, higher net cash paid for income taxes, and the prior-year dividend received from ART that did not repeat in 2018.\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2019 was $210.1 million compared with $618.5 million in 2018 and $129.2 million in 2017. Net cash used for investing activities primarily includes the net cash paid for capital expenditures and businesses acquired. In 2018, we completed the purchase of the polyolefin catalysts business of Albemarle Corporation for $418.0 million. Our capital expenditures include investments in new capacity, improved productivity, information technology, and maintenance of our manufacturing and office facilities. We\nTOC-Financial Statements\nexpect our capital expenditures in 2020 to be approximately $195 million and have entered into commitments related to a portion of those expenditures. We expect to fund our capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities.\nNet cash used for financing activities in 2019 was $99.4 million compared with cash provided of $316.5 million in 2018 and cash used of $134.8 million in 2017. Cash paid for repurchases of common stock in 2019 was $29.8 million, compared with $80.0 million in 2018 and $65.0 million in 2017. We paid cash dividends of $72.6 million in 2019, compared with $64.6 million in 2018 and $57.3 million in 2017. In 2018, we entered into the Credit Agreement and used a portion of the proceeds to repay in full the borrowings outstanding under our 2014 credit agreement.\nDebt and Other Contractual Obligations\nTotal debt outstanding at December 31, 2019, was $1,980.4 million. Set forth below are our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Amounts are based on current interest rates as of December 31, 2019, for principal debt outstanding as of December 31, 2019. Actual interest payments may vary based on any interest rate swaps in effect. \n (2) Amounts do not include open purchase commitments, which are routine in nature and normally settle within 90 days, or obligations to employees under annual or long-term incentive programs. \n (3) Based on the U.S. qualified pension plans' status as of December 31, 2019, minimum funding requirements under ERISA have been estimated for the next five years. Amounts in subsequent years or additional payments have not yet been determined. \n (4) Based on the non-U.S. retirement plans' status as of December 31, 2019, funding requirements have been estimated for the next five years. Amounts in subsequent years have not yet been determined.  See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of Financial Assurances.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of Pension Plans and Other Retirement Plans.\nDefined Contribution Retirement Plan\nWe sponsor a defined contribution retirement plan for our employees in the United States. This plan is qualified under section 401(k) of the U.S. tax code. Currently, we contribute an amount equal to 100% of employee contributions, up to 6% of an individual employee's salary or wages. Our costs related to this benefit plan were $13.9 million, $12.6 million and $11.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nU.S. salaried employees and certain U.S. hourly employees hired on or after January 1, 2017, and employees in Germany hired on or after January 1, 2016, participate in enhanced defined contribution plans instead of defined benefit pension plans. For the U.S. plan, we contribute 4% of an individual employee's salary or wages. For the German plan, contributions vary based on the individual employee's contributions and other factors. Our cost related to these enhanced defined contribution plans established in the United States and\nTOC-Financial Statements\nGermany was $3.7 million, $1.9 million, and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We expect these amounts to increase in the future as more employees enroll in these plans.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for our employees in the U.S., Canada, Germany, and a number of other countries, and fund government-sponsored programs in other countries where we operate. Certain of our defined benefit pension plans are advance-funded and others are pay-as-you-go. The advance-funded plans are administered by trustees who receive direction related to the management of plan assets and arrange to have obligations paid when due. Our most significant advance-funded plans cover current and former salaried employees in the U.S. and employees covered by collective bargaining agreements at certain of our U.S. facilities. Our U.S. advance-funded plans are qualified under the U.S. tax code.\nThe following table presents the funded status of our underfunded and unfunded pension plans:\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Plans intended to be advance-funded. \n (2) Plans intended to be pay-as-you-go.  We have both fully-funded and underfunded pension plans. Our fully-funded plans have assets in excess of projected benefit obligation ( PBO\u201d) of $8.5 million at December 31, 2019. Underfunded plans include a group of advance-funded plans that are underfunded on a PBO basis by a total of $86.1 million as of December 31, 2019. Additionally, we have several plans that are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis, and therefore, the entire PBO for these plans of $448.5 million at December 31, 2019, is unfunded. The net funded status of all of these plans was $526.1 million as of December 31, 2019, and is presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows: $8.5 million in other assets,\u201d $14.8 million in other current liabilities,\u201d $434.6 million in unfunded defined benefit pension plans,\u201d and $85.2 million in underfunded defined benefit pension plans.\u201d\nAt the December 31, 2019, measurement date for the U.S. advance-funded plans, the PBO was $1,029.4 million as measured under U.S. GAAP. The PBO is measured as the present value (using a 3.13% weighted average discount rate as of December 31, 2019) of vested and non-vested benefits earned from employee service to date, based upon current services and estimated future pay increases for active employees. Of the participants in the U.S. advance-funded plans, approximately 79% are retired or former employees or employees of our former businesses, which shortens the duration of the PBO. Assets available to fund the PBO for the U.S. advance-funded plans at December 31, 2019, were $955.6 million, or $73.8 million less than the measured obligation.\nThe following table presents the components of cash contributions for the advance-funded and pay-as-you-go plans:\n\nWe intend to fund non-U.S. pension plans based upon applicable legal requirements and actuarial and trustee recommendations. We contributed $9.1 million related to these plans in 2019.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nOther Contingencies\nSee Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our other contingent matters.\nInflation\nWe recognize that inflationary pressures may have an adverse effect on us through higher asset replacement costs and higher raw materials and other operating costs. We try to minimize these impacts by developing alternative formulations, increasing productivity, hedging purchases of certain raw materials, and increasing prices.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions affecting the assets and liabilities reported at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the revenues and expenses reported for the periods presented. We believe that our accounting estimates are appropriate and the related balances are reasonable; however, actual amounts could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments in future periods. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which the change is identified. Our accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting estimates are described in this section.\nAn accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions and judgments about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period that could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. As part of our quarterly disclosure controls and procedures, management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nContingent Liabilities\nWe have recorded a liability for the resolution of contingencies related to asbestos property damage, environmental remediation, and litigation. We record a liability if we have determined that a loss is probable and we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or have another reasonable basis for recording a liability. We have determined that each of the contingencies discussed below involves an accounting judgment that is material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLegacy Product Liabilities\nWe emerged from an asbestos-related Chapter 11 bankruptcy on February 3, 2014, as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Under the plan of reorganization, all pending and future asbestos-related claims are channeled for resolution to either the PI Trust or the PD Trust. The trusts are the sole recourse for holders of asbestos-related claims. The channeling injunctions issued by the bankruptcy court prohibit holders of asbestos-related claims from asserting such claims directly against us.\nWe have satisfied all of our financial obligations to the PI Trust. We have contingent financial obligations remaining to the PD Trust. With respect to ZAI PD Claims, the PD Trust was funded with $49.4 million (net of $15 million of attorneys' fees) to pay claims and expenses. We are also obligated to make up to 10 contingent deferred payments of $8 million per year to the PD Trust during the 20-year period beginning on the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date, with each such payment due only if the assets of the PD Trust in respect of ZAI PD Claims fall below $10 million during the preceding year. As of December 31, 2019, the PD Trust has paid out approximately $29 million in ZAI PD Claims and expenses, leaving a balance of approximately $23 million, including the benefit of realized investment gains.\nDue to the limited claims history, the unique nature of this product, and the uncertainty of future claims patterns, an actuarial analysis was completed to estimate the range of possible future payments. The analysis was conducted by a third-party actuarial firm directed by us and using historical claims data provided by the ZAI trustee. Certain key assumptions employed in the analysis were (1) projections of the future number of filed claims, assuming a percentage increase in claims during earlier years and annual decreases in later years; (2) application of historical percentages of claims closed with indemnity payment compared to total closed claims, applied on a regional basis; and (3) application of the average claim payout, which reflects the average indemnity cost per claim closing with payment. As a result of the analysis and taking into account the relative uncertainty of\nTOC-Financial Statements\nfuture claims activity, we determined that contingent funding obligations beyond the next five years are not reasonably estimable. We estimate that the reasonable range of payments over the next five years is expected to be between $16 million and $24 million and project that the first payment could be due in 2022. In the 2019 fourth quarter, we recorded a reserve in the amount of $24.0 million related to probable future obligations to fund the PD Trust for ZAI PD Claims. Our maximum financial obligation over the next 19 years is $80.0 million, and no single year's obligation can exceed $8.0 million.\nWith respect to Other PD Claims, claims unresolved as of the Effective Date are to be litigated in the bankruptcy court and any future claims are to be litigated in a federal district court, in each case pursuant to procedures approved by the bankruptcy court. To the extent any such Other PD Claims are determined to be allowed claims, they are to be paid in cash by the PD Trust. We are obligated to make a payment to the PD Trust every six months in the amount of any Other PD Claims allowed during the preceding six months plus interest (if applicable) and the amount of PD Trust expenses for the preceding six months. We have not paid any Other PD Claims since emergence. Annual expenses have been approximately $0.2 million per year. The aggregate amount to be paid under the PD Obligation is not capped, and we may be obligated to make additional payments to the PD Trust in respect of the PD Obligation. We have accrued for those unresolved Other PD Claims that we believe are probable and estimable. We have not accrued for other unresolved or unasserted Other PD Claims as we do not believe that payment is probable.\nAll payments to the PD Trust required after the Effective Date are secured by our obligation to issue 77,372,257 shares of Company common stock to the PD Trust in the event of default, subject to customary anti-dilution provisions.\nEnvironmental Remediation\nWe are obligated under applicable law to remediate certain properties related to our business or former businesses. At some sites we outsource all or a portion of the remediation to third parties, and at others we perform the required remediation ourselves. Our environmental remediation obligation has a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. See disclosure in this Report in Item 1 (Business-Environment, Health and Safety Matters) and in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our environmental remediation liabilities.\nAt sites where third parties conduct remediation, we estimate our obligations from information available to us from these third parties and other consultants, including actual costs incurred, expected future costs and time to completion. At sites where we conduct remediation, we work with regulatory authorities to define compliance requirements and then estimate the cost required to meet those requirements with information available to us. We base our estimates on our historical knowledge and engineering assessments specific to conditions at each site, and we update our estimates as necessary.\nOur estimates can fluctuate significantly due to the extended duration of some remediation projects. The accuracy of our estimates is dependent on the validity of assumptions regarding regulatory approaches and such matters as labor rates, indirect costs and capital costs, which are each difficult to forecast over extended periods. Future changes in estimates, if required, may lead to material adjustments to our Consolidated Financial Statements, and the ultimate resolution of these obligations could have a material impact on our liquidity and capital resources.\nWe purchased a vermiculite mine in Libby, Montana, in 1963 and operated it until 1990. Vermiculite concentrate from the Libby mine was used in the manufacture of attic insulation and other products. Some of the vermiculite ore contained naturally occurring asbestos. We are engaged with the EPA and other federal, state and local governmental agencies in a remedial investigation and feasibility study of the Libby mine and the surrounding area, known as OU3. The RI/FS will determine the specific areas within OU3 requiring remediation and will identify possible remedial action alternatives. Possible remedial actions within OU3 are wide-ranging, from institutional controls such as land use restrictions, to more active measures involving soil removal, containment projects, or other protective measures.\nAs part of the RI/FS process, we contracted an engineering and consulting firm to develop a range of possible remedial alternatives and associated cost estimates for OU3. Based on this work, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $70.0 million in the 2018 third quarter for the estimated costs of remediation of OU3. We believe that\nTOC-Financial Statements\nthis amount should provide for a protective remedy meeting the statutory requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act.\nThe estimated costs of remediation are preliminary and consist of several components, each of which may vary significantly as the remedial alternatives are further developed. It is reasonably possible that the ultimate costs of remediation could range between $30 million and $170 million. We are working closely with the EPA, and the ultimate remedy will be determined by the EPA after the RI/FS is finalized. Such remedy will be set forth in a ROD that is currently expected to be issued by the EPA no earlier than 2021. Costs associated with the more active remedial alternatives would be expected to be incurred over a decade or more. We will reevaluate our estimated liability as remedial alternatives evolve based on further work by the engineering and consulting firm and discussions with the EPA as the RI/FS process moves toward a ROD. Technical memoranda expected prior to the issuance of the ROD may provide insight into the likely remedial alternatives ultimately selected, allowing us to update our cost of remediation estimate. Depending on the remedial alternatives that the EPA selects in the ROD, the total cost of remediating OU3 may exceed our current estimate by material amounts.\nWe have cooperated with the EPA in investigating and remediating a number of formerly owned or operated sites that processed Libby vermiculite into finished products. We have recorded a liability for remaining expected EPA response and oversight costs, and for potential future site remediation, where a review has indicated that liability is probable and the cost is estimable. The EPA may commence additional investigations in the future at other sites that processed Libby vermiculite. Liability for unaccrued additional investigation and remediation costs is probable but not yet estimable, and could be material.\nOther Legacy Liabilities\nOn April 3, 2019, the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation issued a five-year operating permit for a dam at the Libby mine site. We constructed the dam in 1971 to prevent vermiculite ore tailings from moving into nearby creeks and rivers. The permit requires us to complete construction of a new spillway before the permit is further renewed in five years. We contracted a third-party engineering and consulting firm to develop a range of cost estimates for the project. Based on this work we recorded pre-tax charges of $68.0 million in 2019 for the estimated costs of the project. These costs are preliminary and may vary significantly as the project progresses. Based on the consultants' estimates, we believe it is reasonably possible that the ultimate costs of this project could range between $50 million and $100 million. Construction of the new spillway is expected to take three to four years.\nLitigation\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business. To estimate the cost to resolve our legal obligations, we review the facts of each matter to determine the merits of the case and the corresponding probability of a loss. If we determine that a loss is probable, we determine if there is sufficient information to make a reasonable estimate of the loss amount. Our estimates regarding the outcome of our legal proceedings and claims involve substantial uncertainties that could cause our actual losses to differ materially from our estimates. In estimating the likely outcome of a legal proceeding, we consider the nature of the specific claim (or unasserted claim), our experience with similar claims, the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is filed, court rulings, the status of any settlement negotiations, the likelihood of resolution through settlement or alternative dispute resolution, the proceeding's current status and other relevant information and events. We adjust our recorded liability for litigation contingencies as necessary to reflect our current evaluation of these and other factors.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to allocate the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations.\u201d The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded to goodwill. The assessment of fair value requires management to make significant estimates, including future expected revenues, earnings, and cash flows; expected useful lives; and attrition and discount rates. The allocation of the purchase price may be adjusted during the measurement period, which may not exceed one year after the acquisition date.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nWe review our finite-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. We have no indefinite-lived intangible assets. There were no impairment charges recorded in any of the periods presented.\nWe review our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at October 31 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. We have identified our operating segments as reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Our Catalysts Technologies reportable segment has two reporting units for goodwill impairment testing, which are our Refining Technologies and Specialty Catalysts operating segments. Our Materials Technologies operating segment represents a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing.\nWe performed a qualitative analysis as of October 31, 2019, and concluded that the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values.\nPension Expenses and Liabilities\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for our employees in the United States and a number of other countries, including Canada and Germany, and fund government-sponsored programs in other countries where we operate. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of our pension plans.\nIn order to estimate our pension expenses and liabilities we evaluate the range of possible assumptions to be used in the calculation of pension expenses and liabilities. We select the assumptions that we believe to be most indicative of factors such as participant demographics, past experiences and market indices, and provide the assumptions to independent actuaries. These assumptions are updated annually and primarily include factors such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, retirement rates, and rate of compensation increase. The independent actuaries review our assumptions for reasonableness, and use the assumptions to calculate our estimated liability and future pension expense. We review the actuarial reports for reasonableness and adjust our expenses, assets and liabilities to reflect the amounts calculated in the actuarial reports.\nOur method of accounting for actuarial gains and losses relating to its global defined benefit pension plans is referred to as mark-to-market accounting.\u201d Under mark-to-market accounting, our pension costs consist of two elements: (1) ongoing costs recognized quarterly, which include service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service costs/credits; and (2) mark-to-market gains and losses recognized annually in the fourth quarter resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets. Should a significant event occur, our pension obligation and plan assets are remeasured at an interim period, and the gains or losses on remeasurement are recognized in that period.\nThe two key assumptions used in determining our ongoing quarterly pension expense (excluding the effects of the annual mark-to-market adjustment) are the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. Our most significant pension assets and pension liabilities relate to U.S. pension plans.\nThe assumed discount rate for pension plans reflects the market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available and is subject to change based on changes in overall market interest rates. For the U.S. pension plans, the assumed weighted average discount rate was selected in consultation with our independent actuaries, based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan.\nWe selected the expected return on plan assets for the U.S. qualified pension plans for 2019 in consultation with our independent actuaries, using an expected return model. The model determines the weighted average return for an investment portfolio based on the target asset allocation and expected future returns for each asset class, which were developed using a building block approach based on observable inflation, available interest rate information, current market characteristics, and historical results.\nThe following table reflects the sensitivity of 2020 pre-tax expense (excluding the effects of the annual mark-to-market adjustment) and our year-end PBO to a change in the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets assumptions for the U.S. pension plans:\nTOC-Financial Statements\n\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is primarily determined based on our pre-tax income and the statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The effective tax rate also reflects the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax returns, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets are also recorded for NOL and federal tax credit carryforwards.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized by applying enacted tax rates to temporary differences that exist as of the balance sheet date. We reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. The need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed quarterly. In assessing the requirement for, and amount of, a valuation allowance in accordance with the more likely than not standard, we give appropriate consideration to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability and foreign source income ( FSI\u201d), the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforward expirations. A history of cumulative losses is a significant piece of negative evidence used in our assessment. If a history of cumulative losses is incurred for a tax jurisdiction, forecasts of future profitability are not used as positive evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets in the assessment.\nOur net deferred income tax assets (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) as of December 31, 2019, include deferred U.S. federal income tax assets representing federal tax credit carryforwards of $294.7 million and federal NOL carryforwards of $1.2 million, state NOL deferred income tax assets of $51.3 million, and foreign NOL deferred tax assets of $9.6 million. We have established valuation allowances in the amount of $24.1 million, consisting of $10.1 million for state NOL carryforwards, $13.8 million for foreign deferred tax assets, primarily foreign operating loss carryforwards, and $0.2 million for federal NOL carryforwards.\nThe federal tax credit carryforwards arose primarily as a result of the payment of intercompany dividends from our foreign affiliates, from the mandatory repatriation under the TCJA, and from research and development credits. The state NOLs arose primarily as a result of the amounts paid as a result of our bankruptcy proceedings.\nIn order to fully utilize our U.S. federal tax credits before they expire from 2021 to 2039, we will need to generate income of approximately $1.4 billion. We will need to generate approximately $2.5 billion for state income tax purposes during the respective realization periods (ranging from 2020 to 2036) in order to fully realize the state NOLs.\nInherent in determining our effective tax rate are judgments regarding business plans and expectations about future operations. These judgments include the amount and geographic mix of future taxable income, the amount of FSI, limitations on the usage of NOL carryforwards, the impact of ongoing or potential tax audits, and other future tax consequences.\nOur ability to utilize deferred tax assets may be impacted by certain future events, such as changes in tax legislation or insufficient future taxable income or FSI prior to expiration of certain deferred tax assets.\nWe recognize the tax benefits of an uncertain tax position if those benefits are more likely than not to be sustained based on existing tax law. Additionally, we establish a reserve for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained based on existing tax law, if the ultimate benefit to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities is uncertain. Unrecognized tax benefits are subsequently recognized at the time the\nTOC-Financial Statements\nmore likely than not recognition threshold is met, the tax matter is effectively settled or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine and challenge the tax position has expired, whichever is earlier.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated

from the MD&A report:\n\n- Net sales increased 1.3% in 2019 to $1.96 billion, driven by improved pricing and higher sales volumes in Catalysts Technologies. Sales were negatively impacted by some discrete events like a customer bankruptcy.\n\n- Net income attributable to Grace declined to $126.3 million in 2019 from $167.6 million in 2018, primarily due to a loss on pension mark-to-market adjustment and higher costs related to legacy matters. \n\n- Adjusted EBIT increased 3.6% to $473.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018, driven by higher sales and gross profit. Adjusted EPS grew 5.8% to $4.38 per share.\n\n- Grace recorded charges of $68 million for estimated costs of a new dam spillway project and $24 million for future payments related to ZAI product liabilities. \n\n- Catalysts Technologies sales grew 2.3% with higher pricing and volumes, partially offset by discrete events. Materials Technologies sales declined 1.5% but increased 2.2% on constant currency. \n\n- 2019 capital expenditures were $210 million. Grace expects 2020 capital expenditures of approximately $195 million.\n\n- At December 31, 2019, Grace had $282.9 million of cash and $700 million of liquidity. Total debt was $1.98 billion.\n\n- Critical accounting estimates relate to contingent liabilities like asbestos and environmental remediation, goodwill impairment, pension expenses, income taxes, and litigation reserves.\n\nIn summary, Grace delivered solid sales and earnings growth in 2019 despite some headwinds. The company continues to make investments for future growth while maintaining a healthy financial position."}
