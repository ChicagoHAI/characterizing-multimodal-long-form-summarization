MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the Company and its operations and is focused on our 2021 and 2020 financial results, including comparisons of year-over-year performance between these years. Discussion and analysis of our 2019 fiscal year, as well as the year-over-year comparison of our 2020 financial performance to 2019, is located in Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 12, 2021.\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections of future events. However, our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein as a result of the risks that we face, including but not limited to those risks stated in the \"Risk Factors\" section of this report. In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe widespread and unprecedented impact of COVID-19, along with the resulting restrictions on travel and every day activities by local, state, federal, and international governments, significantly reduced air travel demand beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and through 2021.\nThe Safe Travels Hawai'i program was enacted to help control the spread of COVID-19 by enforcing quarantines and pre-travel testing requirements. In June 2021, the Safe Travels Hawai'i program was updated to remove restrictions on travel within the state of Hawai'i, and to permit travelers who were fully vaccinated in the state of Hawai'i to bypass testing or quarantine requirements with proof of vaccination when traveling into the state. In July 2021, all U.S. domestic travelers who were fully vaccinated in the United States also were permitted to bypass pre-travel testing or quarantine requirements with proof of vaccination when entering the state starting the 15th day following completion of their vaccination. In September 2021, both the City and County of Honolulu and the County of Maui enacted programs that impose certain vaccination and testing requirements on employees and customers of restaurants, bars, gyms and other similar establishments, with limited exceptions.\nThe rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations, along with the easing of restrictions in various locations, led to improved domestic travel demand during 2021; however, our passenger revenue was down approximately 47.2% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2019. Restrictions on travel to and from various international locations (including those within our network) remain in effect, continuing to suppress international travel demand, with revenue down 89.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2019. We have continued to evolve throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, building back our network where demand allowed, predominantly within our domestic network, while preparing for the return of other markets as restrictions ease. During 2021, we increased capacity (as measured in ASMs) by approximately 91.5% as compared to 2020; however, capacity in 2021 was down approximately 57.6% as compared to 2019. During the first quarter of 2022, we anticipate capacity will be down between 10% to 13%, as compared to the same period in 2019.\nDuring 2021, our domestic network accounted for approximately 94.0% of total passenger revenue. We continue to monitor developments relating to restrictions on international travel by both the U.S. and international governments, including by the government of Japan, which represents a large percentage of our international revenue. The emergence of new variants of the COVID-19 virus, including the Delta and Omicron variants, continues to impact the rules and regulations governing international travel. In December 2021, President Biden announced that all international travelers aged two and older, regardless of nationality or vaccination status, are required to show documentation of a negative viral test result taken within one day of the flight's departure to the United States.\nDespite the easing of restrictions on travel to and within Hawai'i, uncertainties remain regarding the impact of vaccination-related travel requirements and increased vaccination availability and uptake on the demand for air travel, including the availability, reliability and effectiveness of vaccines domestically and worldwide, particularly as new variants of the COVID-19 virus have emerged and spread. There can be no assurance whether, at some point, the State of Hawai'i or counties within the state may limit or suspend the ability for travelers to bypass quarantine requirements should the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic worsen. The U.S. government and international governments could also impose, extend or otherwise modify existing travel restrictions on international travel. Additionally, ongoing restrictions or shortages in other sectors of the travel industry, such as hotel or transportation availability, including as a result of vaccination requirements and any associated labor shortages, could negatively impact our operations and affect our ability to satisfy any increased demand we experience. As a result of all the above factors and our results to date, we expect bookings, revenue and results of operations in 2022 to be below to flat\ncompared to 2019 levels. Unpredictability in the demand for air travel as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may result in decreases to existing or anticipated levels of demand, and such decreases could be material to our business. We will continue to assess our routes and schedule in response to changes in demand, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGovernment Support Programs\nThe CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 and provided an estimated $2.2 trillion to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and stimulate the U.S. economy. The assistance included tax relief and government loans, grants and investments for entities in affected industries. The CARES Act provided, among other things: (a) financial relief to passenger air carriers for direct payroll support under the PSP, (b) financial relief in the form of loans and loan guarantees available for operations under the Economic Relief Program (ERP), (c) temporary suspension of certain aviation taxes, (d) temporary deferral of certain employer payroll taxes, and (e) additional Corporate tax benefits.\nThe CARES Act also provided for deferred payment of the employer portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50% of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% due December 31, 2022. Lastly, the CARES Act provided for the carryback of additional NOLs to 2016 and 2017, which will result in tax benefits for those years. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nEconomic Relief Program\nIn September 2020, the Company entered into the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement under the ERP pursuant to which the maximum facility available to be borrowed increased to $622.0 million (the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement). In connection with our entry into the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, we also entered into an ERP Warrant Agreement with the Treasury. On September 25, 2020, we borrowed $45.0 million and issued to the Treasury warrants to purchase up to 380,711 shares of our common stock. We recorded the value of the loan and the warrants on a relative fair value basis as $41.9 million in noncurrent debt and $3.1 million in additional paid in capital, respectively.\nOn February 4, 2021, we repaid in full the $45.0 million loan under the ERP, and in connection with this repayment, terminated the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. The debt extinguishment resulted in the recognition of a loss of $4.0 million, which is reflected in nonoperating income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nPayroll Support Program\nOn April 22, 2020, we entered into a Payroll Support Program agreement (the PSP Agreement) with the Treasury under the CARES Act. In connection with the PSP Agreement, we entered into a Warrant Agreement (the PSP Warrant Agreement) with the Treasury, and we issued a promissory note to the Treasury (the Note). Pursuant to the PSP Agreement, the Treasury provided us with financial assistance, paid in installments, totaling approximately $300.9 million, to be used exclusively for the purpose of continuing to pay employee salaries, wages and benefits. Under the PSP Agreement, we agreed to (i) refrain from conducting involuntary furloughs or reducing employee rates of pay or benefits through September 30, 2020, (ii) limit executive compensation through March 24, 2022 and (iii) suspend payment of dividends and stock repurchases through September 30, 2021. The PSP Agreement also imposes certain Treasury-mandated reporting obligations on us. Finally, we are required to continue to provide air service to markets served prior to March 1, 2020 until March 1, 2022, to the extent determined reasonable and practicable by the DOT and subject to exemptions granted by the DOT to us given the absence of demand for certain of such services.\nThe Note was in the total principal amount of approximately $60.3 million. The Note has a 10-year term and bears interest at a rate per annum equal to 1.00% until the fifth anniversary of April 22, 2020 (the PSP Closing Date), and thereafter bears interest at a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate plus 2.00% until the tenth anniversary of the PSP Closing Date, which interest is payable semi-annually beginning on September 30, 2020. The Note may be prepaid at any time, without penalty, and is subject to customary change of control acceleration provisions and events of default.\nAs compensation to the U.S. government for providing financial relief under the PSP Agreement, and pursuant to the PSP Warrant Agreement, we issued to the Treasury a total of 509,964 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $11.82 per share (the PSP Warrants). The PSP Warrants are non-voting, freely transferable, may be settled as net shares or in cash at our option, expire five years from the date of issuance, and contain registration rights and customary anti-dilution provisions. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nThe CAA 2021 was enacted on December 27, 2020, and provided $15.0 billion for airline employee wages, salaries and benefits under an extension (the PSP Extension) of the Payroll Support Program created under the CARES Act. In January 2021, we entered into a PSP extension agreement with the Treasury (the PSP Extension Agreement). PSP Extension funds are required to be used exclusively for the purpose of continuing to pay employee salaries, wages and benefits, including the payment of lost wages, salaries and benefits to certain returning employees, as defined in the PSP Extension Agreement. Under the PSP Extension Agreement, we agreed to (i) refrain from conducting involuntary furloughs or reducing employee rates of pay or benefits from December 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, (ii) recall any employees who were subject to an involuntary termination or furlough between October 1, 2020 and the date of the PSP Extension Agreement and who elected to return to employment pursuant to a recall notice and to compensate these employees for lost salary, wages and benefits, (iii) limit executive compensation through October 1, 2022, and (iv) suspend payment of dividends and stock repurchases through March 31, 2022. Finally, we are required to continue to provide air service to markets served prior to March 1, 2020 until March 1, 2022, to the extent determined reasonable and practicable by the DOT.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we received $192.7 million in grants, entered into a promissory note with the Treasury (the Extension Note) for approximately $27.8 million and issued to the Treasury warrants to purchase up to a total of 156,341 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $17.78 per share (the PSP Extension Warrants) pursuant to the PSP Extension Agreement. The Extension Note has a 10-year term and bears interest at a rate per annum equal to 1.00% for the first five years and at a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate plus 2.00% for the following five years. We recorded the value of the Extension Note and the PSP Extension Warrants on a relative fair value basis as $23.8 million in noncurrent debt and $4.0 million in additional paid in capital, respectively.\nThe ARP 2021 was enacted on March 11, 2021, and included a second PSP extension, providing an additional $14 billion in grants and loans for airline employee wages, salaries and benefits. In April 2021, we entered into a Payroll Support Program 3 Agreement with the Treasury (PSP3 Agreement), a promissory note (the PSP3 Note), and a Warrant Agreement to purchase up to 87,670 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise of $27.27 (the PSP3 Warrants). The PSP3 Agreement extends (i) the prohibition on conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs through September 2021 or the date on which assistance provided under the agreement is exhausted, whichever is later, (ii) the prohibitions on share repurchases and dividends through September 2022, and (iii) the limitations on executive compensation until April 2023. The terms of the PSP3 Note and PSP3 Warrants are consistent with those of the original PSP and the first PSP Extension. During 2021, we received a total of $179.7 million pursuant to the PSP3 Agreement, consisting of approximately $155.8 million in a grant and $23.9 million in a ten-year loan.\nLoyalty Program and Intellectual Property Financing\nOn February 4, 2021, we completed the private offering (the Notes Offering) by Hawaiian Brand Intellectual Property, Ltd., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Hawaiian (the Brand Issuer), and HawaiianMiles Loyalty, Ltd., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Hawaiian (the Loyalty Issuer and, together with the Brand Issuer, the Issuers) of an aggregate of $1.2 billion principal amount of their 5.750% senior secured notes due 2026 (the Notes). The Notes require interest only payments, payable quarterly in arrears on July 20, October 20, January 20 and April 20 of each year, which began on July 20, 2021.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes, Hawaiian contributed to the Brand Issuer, which is a newly-formed subsidiary structured to be bankruptcy remote, all worldwide rights, owned or purported to be owned, or later developed or acquired and owned or purported to be owned, by Hawaiian or any of its subsidiaries, in and to all intellectual property, including all trademarks, service marks, brand names, designs, and logos that include the word \"Hawaiian\" or any successor brand and the \"hawaiianairlines.com\" domain name and similar domain names or any successor domain names (the Brand IP). The Brand Issuer indirectly granted to Hawaiian an exclusive, worldwide, perpetual and royalty-bearing sublicense to use the Brand IP. Further, Hawaiian contributed to the Loyalty Issuer its rights to certain other collateral owned by Hawaiian, including, to the extent permitted by such agreements or otherwise by operation of law, any of Hawaiian's rights under the HawaiianMiles Agreements and the IP Agreements (each as defined in the Indenture, dated as of February 4, 2021), together with HawaiianMiles program (HawaiianMiles) customer data and certain other intellectual property owned or purported to be owned, or later developed or acquired and owned or purported to be owned, by Hawaiian or any of its subsidiaries (including the Issuers) and required or necessary to operate HawaiianMiles (the Loyalty Program IP) (all such collateral being, the Loyalty Program Collateral). The Loyalty Issuer indirectly granted Hawaiian an exclusive, worldwide, perpetual and royalty-free sub-license to use the Loyalty Program IP.\nThe Notes are redeemable at the option of the Issuers, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, after January 20, 2024 at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture, dated as of February 4, 2021 (the Indenture). In addition, the Notes are redeemable, at the option of the Issuers, at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, prior to January 20, 2024 at a\nprice equal to 100% of their principal amount plus the \"make-whole\" premium described in the Indenture and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. Additionally, from time to time on or prior to January 20, 2024, the Issuers may also redeem up to 40% of the original outstanding principal amount of the Notes with proceeds from any one or more equity offerings of Hawaiian at a redemption price equal to 105.75% of the principal amount of Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. Upon the occurrence of certain mandatory prepayment events and mandatory repurchase offer events, the Issuers will be required to make a prepayment on the Notes, or offer to repurchase the Notes, pro rata, to the extent of any net cash proceeds received in connection with such events, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be prepaid, plus, in some cases, an applicable premium. In addition, upon a change of control of Hawaiian, the Issuers may be required to make an offer to prepay the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the respective principal amounts thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date.\nThe Indenture contains certain covenants that limit the ability of the Issuers, the Cayman Guarantors (as defined below) and, in certain circumstances, Hawaiian to, among other things: (i) make Restricted Payments (as defined in the Indenture), (ii) incur additional indebtedness, (iii) create certain liens on the Loyalty Program Collateral, (iv) sell or otherwise dispose of the Loyalty Program Collateral and (v) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Issuers' assets. The Indenture also requires the Issuers and, in certain circumstances, Hawaiian, to comply with certain affirmative covenants, including depositing the Transaction Revenues (as defined in the Indenture) in collection accounts, with amounts to be distributed for the payment of fees, principal and interest on the Notes pursuant to a payment waterfall described in the Indenture, and certain financial reporting requirements. In addition, the Indenture requires Hawaiian to maintain minimum liquidity at the end of any business day of at least $300.0 million.\nSelected Consolidated Statistical Data\nBelow are the operating statistics we use to measure our operating performance.

We believe this is a useful measure because it better reflects our controllable costs. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.\n(c)Includes applicable taxes and fees.\nOperating Revenue\nOur revenue is derived primarily from transporting passengers on our aircraft. We record passenger revenue when the transportation is provided or when scheduled flights for tickets are expected to expire unused. We measure capacity in terms of available seat miles, which represent the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown. Yield, or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile, is calculated by dividing passenger revenue by RPMs. Typically, we strive to increase passenger revenue primarily by increasing our yield per flight or by filling a higher proportion of available seats, which produces higher operating revenue per available seat mile. Other revenue primarily consists of cargo revenue, incidental services revenue, marketing component related to the sale of frequent flyer miles, and contract services.\nOperating revenue was $1.60 billion, $0.84 billion and $2.83 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Operating revenue was severely impacted beginning in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the unprecedented spread and ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although restrictions have eased and passenger travel demand has improved, demand and capacity continue to remain below pre-pandemic levels.\n2021 vs. 2020\nPassenger Revenue\nPassenger revenue increased by $706.1 million, or 106.2%, in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year. Details of this change are described in the table below: Table 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nvs. Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Passenger\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td>Yield </td> <td> </td> <td>RPMs </td> <td> </td> <td>ASM </td> <td> </td> <td>PRASM </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,300.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>783.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>187.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>128.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International </td> <td>70.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(77.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>151.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(81.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total scheduled </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,370.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>706.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>119.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>91.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDomestic passenger revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $783.3 million, or 151.4%, as compared to 2020, on capacity growth of 128.0%. Our increased passenger revenue was the result of improved demand for passenger travel, predominantly within our North America routes, driven by the relaxation of travel restrictions for travel to and within the state of Hawai'i. Despite these improvements, demand on our domestic network remains below our pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, down 32.3% during 2021 as compared to 2019.\nDuring 2021, we expanded service with the addition of three new U.S. mainland destinations: Austin, Texas, Orlando, Florida, and Ontario, California with service to and from Honolulu, Hawai'i, each of which commenced between March and April 2021. We also expanded service with a daily non-stop flight between Kahului, Hawai'i and Long Beach, California, which commenced in March 2021. Additionally, in March and April 2021, respectively, we announced the recommencement of our thrice-weekly service between Kahului, Hawai'i and Las Vegas, Nevada, and launched four-times-weekly seasonal service between Kahului, Hawai'i and Phoenix, Arizona, both of which commenced in May 2021.\nInternational passenger revenue decreased $77.2 million, or 52.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020, as a result of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continued restrictions in place for international travel. Although we recommenced scheduled international passenger flights on a limited basis beginning in late 2020, customer demand across our international network remains depressed given government travel restrictions, particularly as new variants of the COVID-19 virus have emerged and spread. We expect to see depressed international demand through at least the first quarter of 2022 because of the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, with improvement in our international markets expected to lag behind domestic demand recovery until government travel restrictions begin to lift and customer demand starts to return.\nOther Operating Revenue\nOther operating revenue increased by $45.7 million, or 25.4%, in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to reductions in cargo and loyalty program revenue that occurred in the second half of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCargo revenue increased $19.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year due to increased volume and yield as a result of the unfavorable impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on 2020 results; however cargo revenue was down $1.1 million compared to 2019. Loyalty revenue, primarily comprised of brand and marketing performance obligations, increased $17.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior\nyear, as a result of increased credit card spend and new cardholder acquisitions, but down $3.0 million as compared to 2019. Other components in Other operating revenue include, but are not limited to, ground handling and other freight services which collectively, increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 by approximately $8.5 million as compared to the prior year, primarily attributed to increased volumes and contract service operations.\nOperating Expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, total operating expense increased $0.2 billion or 12.5% to $1.7 billion as compared to 2020. Increases (decreases) in operating expenses are detailed below.

The increase in aircraft fuel expense is illustrated in the following table: Table 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except per-gallon amounts) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft fuel expense, including taxes and delivery </td> <td>$ </td> <td>363,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel gallons consumed </td> <td>179,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106,225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average fuel price per gallon, including taxes and delivery </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.02 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe economic fuel expense is the best measure of the effect of fuel prices on our business as it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with the purchase of fuel for our operations and is consistent with how management manages our business and assesses our operating performance. We define economic fuel expense as GAAP fuel expense plus (gains)/losses realized through actual cash (receipts)/payments received from or paid to hedge counterparties for fuel hedge derivative contracts settled in the period inclusive of costs related to hedging premiums.\nEconomic fuel expense is calculated as follows: Table 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except per-gallon amounts) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft fuel expense, including taxes and delivery </td> <td>$ </td> <td>363,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized losses on settlement of fuel derivative instruments </td> <td>165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(98.2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic fuel expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>363,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>170,398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel gallons consumed </td> <td>179,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106,225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic fuel costs per gallon </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.02 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, for additional discussion of our jet fuel costs and related derivative program.\nWages and benefits\nWages and benefits expense increased by $69.5 million, or 11.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior period. Actions taken by the Company in 2020, in response to decreased passenger travel demand attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, had a significant impact on wages and benefits during the prior period. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, improving domestic travel demand led to the ramp up of domestic operations, notably amongst our front-line employees. These actions, combined with scheduled contractual wage increases, resulted in higher wages and benefits during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020. We expect that wages and benefits will increase during the first quarter of 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, as a result of the ramp up of our domestic operations and contractual wage increases.\nMaintenance materials and repairs\nMaintenance materials and repairs increased $48.5 million, or 39.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily attributed to increased utilization of our aircraft commensurate with the ramp up of our operations during the period, as discussed above. We expect maintenance, materials and repairs expense to increase in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, as we continue to rebuild operational capacity combined with scheduled heavy maintenance events and inflationary pressures.\nAircraft and passenger servicing\nAircraft and passenger servicing expense increased by $47.7 million, or 82.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily due to increased capacity and passengers flown, as discussed above. We expect aircraft and passenger servicing expense to increase in the first quarter of 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, as we continue to rebuild operational capacity.\nCommissions and other selling expenses\nCommissions and other selling expenses increased by $26.2 million, or 56.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year. The increase in commissions and other selling expense was primarily related to the increase in operational capacity and passenger travel, as discussed above. We expect commissions and other selling expense to increase in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 as we continue to rebuild our operational capacity.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $13.4 million, or 8.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year. The decrease is attributed to (a) the reclassification of approximately $29.5 million of ATR and commercial real estate assets to assets held for sale and (b) a reduction in capital expenditures during 2021 and 2020 below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels while other existing fixed assets have fully depreciated.\nOther rentals and landing fees\nOther rentals and landing fees increased by $43.0 million, or 58.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year. A portion of our other rentals and landing fees are variable in nature and are dependent on factors such as the number of departures and passengers. The increase in landing fees and other rents is attributed to increased operations as discussed above. We expect other rentals and landing fees expense to increase in the first quarter of 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, as we rebuild operational capacity and passenger travel demand continues to improve, and due to inflationary pressures and increased infrastructure projects at various airports in which we operate, the costs of which are passed onto airlines.\nSpecial items\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we announced the termination of our 'Ohana by Hawaiian operations, which operated under a capacity purchase agreement (CPA) with a third-party carrier. We reclassified approximately $23.6 million to assets held for sale and recognized a one-time expense of $6.4 million to write-down the asset group to fair value. Additionally, we recorded a charge of approximately $2.6 million for the early termination of the CPA.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 we recognized approximately $184.1 million of special items expense, comprised of the following:\n\u2022In March 2020, we reached an agreement in principle with our flight attendants, represented by the AFA, on a new five-year contract that runs through April 2025. On April 3, 2020, we received notification from the AFA that a collective bargaining agreement (the CBA) was ratified by its members. The ratified CBA provides for, among other things, a ratification payment to be paid over a one-year term, increased medical cost sharing, improved pay scales, and a one-time medical savings contribution to eligible flight attendants upon retirement. During the first quarter of 2020, we recorded a $23.5 million ratification bonus, of which $20.2 million was related to service prior to January 1, 2020, and recognized this as a special item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The remaining $3.3 million was recorded as a component of wages and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\u2022During the first quarter of 2020, the adverse economic impact and declining passenger demand attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic drove our stock price to 52-week lows and significantly reduced future cash flow projections. We qualitatively assessed that an impairment loss may have been incurred as of March 31, 2020 and performed an interim test of the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We determined that the estimated fair value of our one reporting unit was less than its carrying value and that the deficit between fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded the amount of goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, leading to the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge of $106.7 million in the first quarter of 2020.\n\u2022During the second quarter of 2020, we recorded special items of $34.0 million comprised of: (a) an impairment charge of $27.5 million to mark down our ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleets to fair value; (b) an impairment charge of $3.4 million to mark down our commercial real estate assets to fair value; and (c) an approximately $3.1 million write-off for discontinued software-related projects as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022During the third quarter of 2020, we announced and completed voluntary separation programs across each of our labor groups providing for one-time severance payments, the establishment of health reimbursement accounts and other benefits. Additionally, we announced involuntary separation and temporary leave programs, the majority of which were effective October 1, 2020. We recorded $17.8 million in severance and benefits as an operating special item and $5.7 million related to special termination benefits and curtailment loss as a nonoperating special item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\u2022During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded long-lived asset impairment of approximately $5.4 million, comprised of an additional write-down of our ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleet of approximately $4.9 million as a result of ongoing market uncertainty attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also wrote off of approximately $0.5 million in capitalized software projects that were permanently suspended in response to the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we recorded $0.3 million in additional costs for the finalization of the separation programs discussed above.\nGovernment grant recognition\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we received $372.4 million and $300.9 million in federal payroll support payments, of which $320.6 million and $240.6 million, respectively, was in the form of a grant. These funds were required to be used exclusively for the payment of employee wages, salaries and benefits. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized approximately $320.6 million and $240.6 million, respectively, as contra-expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2021, we utilized all funds received under the federal payroll support programs to pay salaries and wages and reinstate employees previously impacted by involuntary leaves and terminations.\nOther expense\nOther expense increased by $9.0 million, or 8.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributed to our ramp up of operations and increase in technology projects, including personnel-related expenditures for crew travel, professional and technical services, and other miscellaneous expenditures. We expect other expense to increase during the first quarter of 2022 as we continue to rebuild operational capacity.\nNonoperating expense, net\nNet nonoperating expense increased by $50.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year. The increase in expense was primarily attributed to an increase in interest expense as a result of the $1.2 billion loyalty and intellectual property financing completed in February 2021 combined with the recognition of approximately $38.9 million in losses related to the extinguishment of long-term debt. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. These losses were offset by approximately $27.6 million in unrealized gains associated with our Japanese Yen-denominated debt as a result of favorable exchange rates.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective tax rate was 21.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with 27.0% for the prior year. The effective tax rate represents a blend of federal and state taxes and includes the impact of the $4.4 million valuation allowance reserve recorded against state deferred tax assets. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, we took various actions to increase liquidity and strengthen our financial position. For discussion on the actions we took in 2020, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 12, 2021. Refer to Cash Flow and Uses of Liquidity section for discussion of 2021 financing activities.\nCash, cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash) and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared to $0.9 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by approximately $902.9 million as compared to $113.93 million as of December 31, 2020. Approximately $631.2 million of our current liabilities relate to our advanced ticket sales and frequent flyer deferred revenue.\nWe cannot assure you that the assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements will be correct because we have never experienced such an unprecedented event impacting global travel and, as a consequence, our ability to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain. In addition, the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain. However, we expect to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months with cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash), short-term investments and cash flows from operations. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and financing arrangements.\nCash Flow and Uses of Liquidity\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $251.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $310.7 million in the prior year. Our operating cash flows are impacted by the following factors:\nAdvanced Ticket Sales. We sell tickets for air travel and record the receipt on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability. The air traffic liability typically increases during the winter and spring months as advanced ticket sales grow prior to the summer and fall peak travel seasons and decreases upon utilization during these seasons. The ongoing impact of COVID-19 has resulted in a lower level of advanced bookings than historically experienced, which has impacted seasonal trends. As discussed above, we noted marked improvements in air travel demand in 2021, as compared to 2020; however, demand (measured in passengers flown) and revenue remain well below 2019 levels. The ongoing impact and severity of the reduction in travel demand due to COVID-19 and related variants are uncertain, as described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nFuel. Fuel expense represented approximately 21.6% of our total operating expense in 2021. The market price for jet fuel is volatile, which can impact the comparability of our cash flows from operations. We expect fuel consumption to increase in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 as we continue to ramp up operational capacity.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Funding. We sponsor a defined pension plan covering eligible pilots and retirees. This plan is closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals. Additionally, we sponsor four unfunded defined benefit postretirement medical and life insurance plans and a separate plan to administer the pilots' disability benefits. As of December 31, 2021, the excess of the projected benefit obligations over the fair value of plan assets was approximately $168.4 million. We contributed $4.1 million to our disability plan in both 2021 and 2020.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we were not required to, and did not make, contributions to our defined benefit pension plan. Future funding requirements for our defined benefit and other postretirement plans are dependent upon many factors such as interest rates, funded status, applicable regulatory requirements and the level and timing of asset returns. Given available funding credits in the defined benefit plan and funding status, we do not anticipate requiring any cash contributions to our defined benefit plan between 2022 through 2024. For our pilot's disability plan, we anticipate annual contributions to the plan of approximately $4.0 million between 2022 and 2026.\nGovernment Support Programs. Operating cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 included $320.6 million and $240.6 million in proceeds received as part of the government payroll support programs, all of which was utilized in each respective year to offset eligible payroll and payroll-related costs. As of December 31, 2021, all funds were utilized towards their stated purpose.\nOperating Lease Obligations. As described further in Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2021 we had a total of $502.5 million of minimum operating lease obligations. These minimum lease payments range from approximately $59.9 million to $104.5 million on an annual basis over the next five years.\nOther Commitments. We have certain purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services, including, but not limited to aircraft maintenance, IT, capacity purchases, and reservations. Total contractual obligations do not include long-term contracts where the commitment is variable in nature (with no minimum guarantee), such as aircraft maintenance deposits due under operating leases and fees due under certain other agreements such as aircraft maintenance power-by-the-hour, computer reservation systems and credit card processing agreements, or when the agreements contain short-term cancellation provisions. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $4.8 billion of such obligations, which range from approximately $439.8 million to $1.7 billion on an annual basis over the next five years.\nInvesting Activities\nShort-Term Investments. During 2021, we acquired approximately $897.8 million (net of sales) in short-term investments, a portion of which was funded from proceeds we obtained through our financing transactions. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these investments.\nCapital Expenditures. Our capital expenditures are primarily related to the purchase of aircraft, fleet modifications and technology enhancements. Our capital expenditures decreased to $39.3 million in 2021 as compared to $105.3 million in 2020, primarily as a result of the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and our focus on strengthening our financial position.\nWe expect that we will have capital expenditures between approximately $105 million and $125 million in 2022, primarily for aircraft, including advance deposit payments for future aircraft deliveries and aircraft modifications, along with facility upgrades and technology enhancements. We expect that the capital expenditures in 2022 will be funded through available liquidity and cash flows from operations. We have committed to future aircraft purchases, with scheduled deliveries between 2023 and 2026.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had the following capital commitments consisting of firm aircraft and engine orders and purchase rights:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft Type </td> <td>Firm\nOrders </td> <td> </td> <td>Purchase\nRights </td> <td> </td> <td>Expected Delivery Dates </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A321neo aircraft </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>B787-9 aircraft </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Between 2023 and 2026 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General Electric GEnx spare engines: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>B787-9 spare engines </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Between 2023 and 2025 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommitted expenditures for these aircraft, engines, and related flight equipment are approximately $92 million in 2022, $418 million in 2023, $503 million in 2024, $411 million in 2025, and $234 million in 2026.\nIn October 2020, we entered into an amendment to our Boeing 787-9 purchase agreement, which changed the scheduled delivery of each aircraft and related engines to between 2022 and 2026. In December 2021, we received notification of further delivery delays, and we have agreed to defer delivery of our first two aircraft from the scheduled delivery date at the end of 2022, to the first half of 2023. The remainder of the B787-9 delivery schedule has not changed. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nIn order to complete the purchase of these aircraft and fund related costs, we may need to secure acceptable financing. We have backstop financing available from aircraft and engine manufacturers, subject to certain customary conditions. Financing may be necessary to satisfy our capital commitments for firm order aircraft and other related capital expenditures. We can provide no\nassurance that any financing not already in place for aircraft and spare engine deliveries will be available to us on acceptable terms when necessary or at all.\nFinancing Activities\nDebt and finance lease obligations. As discussed above, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that began in early 2020, we took actions to shore up our liquidity and financial position. In February 2021, we also completed the issuance of $1.2 billion in 5.75% senior secured notes, which are collateralized by our loyalty program and intellectual property. The Notes require quarterly interest payments and mature in January 2026. See above and Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the offering.\nAs our liquidity stabilized following the offering, we repaid approximately $440.9 million in future debt obligations during the year ended December 31, 2021 as follows:\n\u2022In February 2021, we (a) paid in full the $45.0 million ERP loan issued pursuant to the CARES Act, and in connection with such repayment, terminated the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. The warrants remain outstanding pursuant to the terms of the agreement, and (b) repaid the $235.0 million outstanding balance drawn on our revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility matures in December 2022 and remains available to draw upon at a future date in the event the need arises.\n\u2022In October 2021, we repurchased approximately $160.9 million of our outstanding 7.375% Series 2020-1A Pass Through Certificates due 2027 and 11.250% Series 2020-1B Pass Through Certificates due 2025, and incurred a $34.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which is recorded in loss on extinguishment of debt in non-operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIn addition, we received approximately $372.4 million through government payroll support programs discussed above, of which approximately $51.7 million was issued as a Note due at maturity in 2031.\nAs of December 31, 2021 our total debt was $1.8 billion, compared to $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nFuture Debt Obligations. As described in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2021, scheduled maturities of our debt in 2022 and 2023 were $98.7 million and $63.7 million, with scheduled maturities from 2024 through 2026 of $61.6 million, $79.1 million, and $1,347.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, scheduled maturities after 2026 aggregate to $188.3 million. In addition, we are obligated to make periodic interest payments at fixed and variable rates, depending on the terms of the applicable debt agreements. Based on applicable interest rates and scheduled debt maturities as of December 31, 2021, these interest obligations total $87.0 million in 2022, $84.0 million in 2023, $82.2 million in 2024, $80.1 million in 2025, $24.3 million in 2026, and $11.7 million thereafter.\nFinance Lease Obligations. As described further in Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2021, we had a total of $125.1 million of minimum finance lease obligations. These minimum lease payments range from approximately $11.3 million to $29.5 million on an annual basis over the next five years.\nIssuance of Equity. In December 2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the Equity Distribution Agreement) with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, BNP Paribas Securities Corp. and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (the Managers) relating to the issuance and sale of up to 5.0 million shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we sold 2.9 million shares pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement at an average price of $24.47 per share, with net proceeds totaling approximately $68.1 million. As of March 5, 2021, we sold all of the 5.0 million shares authorized under the Equity Distribution Agreement, at an average price of $22.46 per share, with net proceeds of approximately $109.3 million.\nReturn to Shareholders. In November 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock over a two-year period through December 2020. On March 18, 2020, we indefinitely suspended all repurchases under the approved repurchase plan in connection with our receipt of financial assistance under federal Payroll Support Programs, which restricts us from repurchasing shares and making dividend payments until September 30, 2022. We spent $7.5 million to repurchase and retire approximately 0.3 million shares of our common stock in open market transactions during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following table displays information with respect to our stock repurchase programs as of December 31, 2021:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except repurchase price) </td> <td> </td> <td>Share Repurchase Authorization\n(in '000s) </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average Repurchase Price </td> <td> </td> <td>Planned Completion Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Authorization Remaining\n(in '000s) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>April 2015 Program </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25.75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>April 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>Completed April 2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>April 2017 Program </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39.85 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>May 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Completed December 2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 2017 Program </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Completed December 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 2018 Program </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Suspended </td> <td> </td> <td>Suspended </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe declared and paid cash dividends of $0.0 million, $5.5 million, and $22.8 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our receipt of financial assistance under federal Payroll Support Programs precludes us from making any further dividend payments until September 30, 2022.\nUndrawn Lines of Credit. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $235.0 million undrawn and available under our revolving credit facility that matures in December 2022. We are currently exploring options to renew our revolving credit facility.\nCredit Card Holdbacks. Under our bank-issued credit card processing agreements, proceeds from advance ticket sales may be held back to serve as collateral to cover any possible chargebacks or other disputed charges that may occur. These holdbacks, are reported as restricted cash in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no holdbacks held with our credit card processors. In the event of a material adverse change in our business, the holdback could increase to an amount up to 100% of the applicable credit card activity for all unflown tickets, which would also result in an increase in the required level of restricted cash. If we are unable to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate the increase in the restriction of cash, it could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nCovenants. We are in compliance with covenants in our debt and lease agreements at December 31, 2021.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe believe the disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures is useful information to readers of our financial statements because:\n\u2022We believe it is the basis by which we are evaluated by industry analysts and investors;\n\u2022These measures are often used in management and Board of Directors' decision making analysis;\n\u2022It improves a reader's ability to compare our results to those of other airlines; and\n\u2022It is consistent with how we present information in our quarterly earnings press releases.\nSee table below for reconciliation between GAAP consolidated net income to adjusted consolidated net income, including per share amounts (in thousands unless otherwise indicated). The adjustments are described below:\n\u2022During the year ended December 31, 2020, the effective tax rate included a tax benefit of $45.4 million resulting from the rate differential between the prevailing tax rate of 21% during the years that generated the NOLs and the previous tax rate of 35% that was in effect during the years to which NOLs were carried back as a result of the enactment of the CARES Act. This benefit is attributed to the enactment of the CARES Act and we believe that exclusion of this tax benefit provides investors comparability of results between periods.\n\u2022During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized $320.6 million in contra-expense related to grant proceeds from the federal payroll support programs as compared to $240.6 million recognized in the prior year. The grant proceeds were recognized in proportion to estimated wages and benefits expense over the period the grant covers. We utilized all proceeds under the federal payroll support programs as of December 31, 2021.\n\u2022Losses on the extinguishment of debt are excluded to allow investors to better analyze our core operational performance and more readily compare our results to other results in the periods presented below.\n\u2022Changes in fair value of derivative contracts, net of tax, are based on market prices for open contracts as of the end of the reporting period. This adjustment includes the unrealized gains and losses on fuel and interest rate derivatives (not designated as hedges) that will settle in future periods and the reversal of prior period unrealized amounts. Excluding the impact of these derivative adjustments allows investors to analyze our core operational performance and compare our results to other airlines in the periods presented below.\n\u2022Changes in fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts, net of tax, are based on market prices for open contracts as of the end of the reporting period. This adjustment includes the unrealized amounts of foreign currency derivatives (not designated as hedges) that will settle in future periods and the reversal of prior period unrealized amounts. We believe that excluding the impact of these derivative adjustments helps investors analyze our operational performance and compare our results to other airlines in the periods presented below.\n\u2022Change in unrealized losses (gains) on foreign debt are based on fluctuations in foreign exchanges rates related to foreign-denominated debt agreements. We believe that excluding the impact of these amounts helps investors analyze our operational performance and compare our results to other airlines in the periods presented below.\nSpecial Items\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 we recognized approximately $184.1 million of special items expense, comprised of the following:\n\u2022During the first quarter of 2020, we recognized $126.9 million of special items in the Consolidated Statements of Operation, comprised of the following:\n\u25e6On April 3, 2020, we received notification from the AFA that the CBA was ratified by its members. The ratified CBA provided for, among other things, a ratification payment, payable over twelve months. We recorded a $23.5 million ratification bonus, of which $20.2 million related to service prior to January 1, 2020, and was recorded as a special item.\n\u25e6We recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $106.7 million. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n\u2022During the second quarter of 2020, we recognized a charge of $34.0 million associated with the impairment of certain of our long-lived assets. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n\u2022During the third quarter of 2020, we announced and completed voluntary separation programs across each of our labor groups providing for one-time severance payments, the establishment of health reimbursement accounts and other benefits. Additionally, we announced involuntary separation programs, the majority of which were effective October 1, 2020. We recorded $17.5 million in severance and benefits as an operating special item and $5.7 million related to special termination benefits and curtailment loss as a nonoperating special item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\u2022During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded long-lived asset impairment of approximately $5.4 million, comprised of an additional write-down of our ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleet of approximately $4.9 million as a result of ongoing market uncertainty attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also wrote off approximately $0.5 million in capitalized software projects that were permanently suspended in response to the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we recorded $0.3 million in additional costs for the finalization of the voluntary and involuntary separation programs discussed above.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we recognized approximately $9.0 million of special items expense, comprised of the following:\n\u2022During the second quarter of 2021, we announced the termination of our 'Ohana by Hawaiian operations, which operated under a CPA with a third-party carrier. The asset group met the requirements for, and was reclassified as Held-for-Sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We fair valued the asset group resulting in the write-down of approximately $6.4 million. Additionally, we recorded an early termination charge associated with the CPA of approximately $2.6 million.\nWe believe that excluding such special items helps investors analyze our operational performance and compare our results to other airlines in the periods presented below.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Diluted Per Share </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Diluted Per Share </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Diluted Per Share </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except for per share data) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP net income (loss), as reported </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(144,773) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2.85) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(510,935) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11.08) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>223,984 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.71 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted for: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CARES Act - carryback of additional NOLs </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45,416) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.99) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government grant recognition </td> <td>(320,645) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.32) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(240,648) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.22) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt </td> <td>38,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in fair value of fuel derivative contracts </td> <td>(382) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.01) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,105) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.05) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,694) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.13) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized loss (gain) on non-designated fx positions </td> <td>(1,352) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.03) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized loss (gain) on foreign debt </td> <td>(27,593) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.54) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.02 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of aircraft </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,948) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.04) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special items </td> <td>8,983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184,111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.99 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonoperating special items </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax effect of adjustments </td> <td>63,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.04 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(383,432) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7.55) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(550,973) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11.96) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>218,883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.60 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM)\nWe have separately listed in the table below our fuel costs per ASM and non-GAAP unit costs, excluding fuel and special items.

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those accounting policies and accounting estimates that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and that potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below. See the summary of significant accounting policies included in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the application of these estimates and other accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nPassenger revenue. We record direct passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on Hawaiian as passenger revenue when the transportation is provided or when scheduled flights for tickets are expected to expire unused.\nThe value of unused passenger tickets is included in current liabilities as Air traffic liability. Prior to the second quarter of 2020, non-refundable tickets sold and credits issued generally expired 13 months from the date of issuance or flight, as applicable. In April 2020, we announced the waiver of certain change fees and extended ticket validity for up to 24 months for (a) tickets issued between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 and (b) tickets issued prior to March 1, 2020 for original travel between March 1, 2020 and February 28, 2021. In December 2021, we announced the further extension of ticket validity to December 31, 2022, which also includes all Main Cabin and First Class passenger tickets purchased in 2021. We record an estimate of breakage revenue on the scheduled flight date for tickets that will expire unused. These estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results, available market information, forecasted trends and the extension of the expiration date for certain tickets impacted by COVID-19. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized approximately $48.3 million in advanced ticket breakage. The primary assumption utilized in our calculation of advanced ticket breakage involves an estimate of future breakage patterns, which is based on a combination of historical activity and expected customer behavior. A 10% change in this rate represents a change of approximately $4.8 million in advanced ticket breakage. Given the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on actual results and its continued impact on travel demand, we continue to monitor customers' travel behavior and may adjust our estimates in the future.\nTicket change fees are recorded in Air traffic liability and recognized when the related transportation is provided. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized approximately $4.8 million and $11.3 million, respectively in ticket change fee revenue.\nFrequent flyer revenue. HawaiianMiles, Hawaiian's frequent flyer travel award program, provides a variety of awards to program members based on accumulated mileage. ASC 606 requires us to account for miles earned by passengers in the HawaiianMiles program through flight activity as a component of the passenger revenue ticket transaction at the estimated selling price of the miles. Ticket consideration received is allocated between the performance obligations, primarily travel and miles earned by passengers. The allocated value of the miles is deferred until the free travel or other award is used by the passenger, at which time it is included in passenger revenue. The value of the ticket used in the determination of the estimated selling price is based on the historical value of equivalent flights to those provided for loyalty awards and the related miles redeemed to obtain that award adjusted for breakage or fulfillment. The equivalent ticket value (ETV) includes a fulfillment discount (breakage) to reflect the value of the award ticket over the number of miles that, based on historical experience, will be needed to obtain the award. On a quarterly basis, we calculate the ETV by analyzing the fares of similar tickets for the prior 12 months, considering cabin class and geographic region.\nWe also sell mileage credits to companies participating in our frequent flyer program. These contracts generally include multiple performance obligations, including the transportation that will ultimately be provided when the mileage credits are redeemed and marketing and brand related activities.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we amended our partnership with Barclaycard US, Hawaiian's co-branded credit card partner. Management determined that the amendment should be accounted for as a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract under ASC 606 and the relative selling price was determined for each performance obligation of the new agreement. The new agreement continues through 2024 and includes improved economics and enhanced product offerings for our Barclay's co-branded cardholders. The amended agreement did not change, and includes the following performance obligations; (i) transportation that will ultimately be provided when mileage credits are redeemed (transportation), (ii) the Hawaiian Airlines brand and access to its members lists (collectively, brand performance), (iii) marketing, and (iv) airline benefits to cardholders, including discounts and anniversary travel benefits, baggage waivers and inflight purchase credits. We determined the relative fair value of each performance obligation by estimating the selling prices of the deliverables by\nconsidering discounted cash flows using multiple inputs and assumptions, including: (1) the expected number of miles to be awarded and redeemed; (2) the estimated weighted average equivalent ticket value, adjusted by a fulfillment discount; (3) the estimated total annual cardholder spend; (4) an estimated royalty rate for the Hawaiian portfolio; and (5) the expected use of each of the airline benefits. The overall consideration received is allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative selling prices.\nThe transportation performance obligation is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when the transportation is provided. The value to the financial institution is provided each time a new cardholder chooses the Hawaiian branded credit card and each time a cardholder chooses to use the co-branded credit card. Therefore, we recognize revenue for the brand performance obligation as members use their co-brand credit card and the resulting mileage credits are issued to them, which best correlates with our performance toward satisfying the obligation.\nAccounting for frequent flyer revenue involves the use of various techniques to estimate revenue. To determine the total estimated transaction price, we forecast future credit card activity based on historical data. The relative selling price is determined using management's estimated standalone selling price of each performance obligation. The objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis. Accordingly, we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including, but not limited to, discounted cash flows, brand value, number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed. We estimate the selling price of miles using an ETV adjusted for a fulfillment discount as described above.\nIn April 2021, we announced the elimination of our HawaiianMiles expiration policy, effective April 1, 2021. Prior to this change in policy, miles expired after 18 months of member account inactivity. We review our breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns (e.g., credit card and non-credit card holders). Our estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment. Current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy, or to program rules and program could affect the estimated value of a mile. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including changes to our ticket validity and exchange policies, management continues to monitor customers' travel behavior and may adjust its estimates in the future as additional information becomes available. We do not believe that the change in expiration policy will have a material impact on our accounting estimates and will continue to evaluate the impact of this change as additional information becomes available.\nPension and Other Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits\nThe calculation of pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit expenses and its corresponding liabilities require the use of significant assumptions, including the assumed discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, expected mortality rates of the plan participants, and the expected health care cost trend rate. Changes in these assumptions will impact the expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience may differ from these assumptions.\nThe significant assumptions as of December 31, 2021 are as follows:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate to determine projected benefit obligation </td> <td>2.98 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets </td> <td>6.29 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>^ </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Postretirement: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate to determine projected benefit obligation </td> <td>2.99 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected health care cost trend rate: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Initial </td> <td>6.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ultimate </td> <td>4.75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years to reach ultimate trend rate </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Disability: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate to determine projected benefit obligation </td> <td>3.03 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets </td> <td>4.28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>^ </td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/A Not Applicable\n^ Expected return on plan assets used to determine the net periodic benefit expense for 2022 is 6.06% for the pension plans and 4.35% for the disability plan.\nThe expected long-term rate of return assumption is developed by evaluating input from the trustee managing the plans' assets, including the trustee's review of asset class return expectations by several consultants and economists, as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets, which is based on our goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels. The Retirement Plan for Pilots of Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. and the Pilot's Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association Disability and Survivor's Benefit Plan strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from any one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. We believe that our long-term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation. We periodically review our actual asset allocation and rebalance the pension plan's investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return by 100 basis points will have the following effects on our estimated 2022 pension and disability benefit expense recorded in wages and benefits and nonoperating expense: Table 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>100 Basis Point Decrease </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in estimated 2022 pension expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in estimated 2022 disability benefit expense </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe determine the appropriate discount rate for each of our plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due. The pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and future expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate by 100 basis points would have the following effects:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>100 Basis Point Decrease </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in pension obligation as of December 31, 2021 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in other postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2021 </td> <td>21.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in estimated 2022 pension expense (operating and nonoperating) </td> <td>(0.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in estimated 2022 other postretirement benefit expense (operating and nonoperating) </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience taking into account current and expected market conditions. Changes in the assumed current health care cost trend rate by year by 100 basis points would have the following annual effects:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>100 Basis Point Increase </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in other postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2021 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in estimated 2022 other postretirement benefit expense (operating and nonoperating) </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>100 Basis Point Decrease </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in other postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2021 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in estimated 2022 other postretirement benefit expense (operating and nonoperating) </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets used in operations, consisting principally of aircraft and other non-aircraft equipment, are classified as property and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and have a carrying value of approximately $2.0 billion at December 31, 2021. We review long-lived assets used in operations for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying value. To determine whether impairment exists for aircraft used in operations, assets are grouped at the fleet-type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and future cash flows are estimated based on projections of capacity, passenger mile yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors. If, at any time, management determines the net carrying value of an asset is not recoverable, the amount is reduced to its fair value during the period in which such determination is made. Any changes in the estimated useful lives of these assets will be accounted for prospectively.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 we identified indicators of impairment of our long-lived assets. During the second quarter of 2020, it was determined that the net carrying values of our ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleets and assets held under our commercial real estate subsidiary were not recoverable through the generation of future undiscounted cash flows as of June 30, 2020. We estimated the fair value of our ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleets using a third-party valuation, which takes into consideration market pricing information, among other factors, and resulted in a $27.5 million impairment charge. We estimated the fair value of our commercial real-estate entity using a combination of a market and income-based approach, which estimates fair value based upon projections of future revenues, expenses, and cash flows discounted to its present value, which resulted in a $3.4 million impairment charge. The principal assumptions used in our discounted cash flow analysis consisted of (a) the long-term projections of future financial performance and (b) the weighted-average cost of capital of market participants, adjusted for the risk attributable to us and the industry in which we operate.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded long-lived asset impairment of approximately $5.4 million, comprised of an additional write-down of our ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleet of $4.9 million as a result of ongoing market uncertainty attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also wrote off of approximately $0.5 million in capitalized software projects that were permanently suspended in response to the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we announced the termination of our 'Ohana by Hawaiian operations, which utilizes the ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleet, and was operated under a capacity purchase agreement (CPA) with a third-party carrier. Following the termination of the operations, which were temporarily suspended in late 2020, management committed to a plan of sale and wrote-down the related assets by approximately $6.4 million to fair value, less cost to sell, and classified approximately $23.4 million as assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2021, management committed to a plan to sell certain commercial real-estate assets held by one of the Company's subsidiaries. Management fair valued the assets, less the cost to sell, which did not result in a write-down to the asset group, and as of December 31, 2021, reclassified approximately $6.1 million as assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management expects to complete the sale of the above referenced assets within 12 months from the original designation date, and will continue to monitor the asset groups for potential impairment.\nIn addition, we will continue to monitor the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and will continue to evaluate our current fleet and other long-lived assets for impairment accordingly.\nIncome Tax Valuation Allowance\nWe periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets and establish valuation allowances if it is not likely we will realize our deferred income tax assets. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, our deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical financial results, our industry's historically cyclical financial results and potential current and future tax planning strategies. We cannot presently determine when we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to realize all of our state deferred tax assets. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a valuation allowance of $14.1 million and $9.6 million, respectively, against our deferred tax assets. If we determine that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the remainder of our deferred income tax assets, we will reverse our valuation allowance (in full or in part), resulting in an income tax benefit in the period such a determination is made.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the Company and its operations and is focused on our 2021 and 2020 financial results, including comparisons of year-over-year performance between these years. Discussion and analysis of our 2019 fiscal year, as well as the year-over-year comparison of our 2020 financial performance to 2019, is located in Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 12, 2021.\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections of future events. However, our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein as a result of the risks that we face, including but not limited to those risks stated in the \"Risk Factors\" section of this report. In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe widespread and unprecedented impact of COVID-19, along with the resulting restrictions on travel and every day activities by local, state, federal, and international governments, significantly reduced air travel demand beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and through 2021.\nThe Safe Travels Hawai'i program was enacted to help control the spread of COVID-19 by enforcing quarantines and pre-travel testing requirements. In June 2021, the Safe Travels Hawai'i program was updated to remove restrictions on travel within the state of Hawai'i, and to permit travelers who were fully vaccinated in the state of Hawai'i to bypass testing or quarantine requirements with proof of vaccination when traveling into the state. In July 2021, all U.S. domestic travelers who were fully vaccinated in the United States also were permitted to bypass pre-travel testing or quarantine requirements with proof of vaccination when entering the state starting the 15th day following completion of their vaccination. In September 2021, both the City and County of Honolulu and the County of Maui enacted programs that impose certain vaccination and testing requirements on employees and customers of restaurants, bars, gyms and other similar establishments, with limited exceptions.\nThe rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations, along with the easing of restrictions in various locations, led to improved domestic travel demand during 2021; however, our passenger revenue was down approximately 47.2% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2019. Restrictions on travel to and from various international locations (including those within our network) remain in effect, continuing to suppress international travel demand, with revenue down 89.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2019. We have continued to evolve throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, building back our network where demand allowed, predominantly within our domestic network, while preparing for the return of other markets as restrictions ease. During 2021, we increased capacity (as measured in ASMs) by approximately 91.5% as compared to 2020; however, capacity in 2021 was down approximately 57.6% as compared to 2019. During the first quarter of 2022, we anticipate capacity will be down between 10% to 13%, as compared to the same period in 2019.\nDuring 2021, our domestic network accounted for approximately 94.0% of total passenger revenue. We continue to monitor developments relating to restrictions on international travel by both the U.S. and international governments, including by the government of Japan, which represents a large percentage of our international revenue. The emergence of new variants of the COVID-19 virus, including the Delta and Omicron variants, continues to impact the rules and regulations governing international travel. In December 2021, President Biden announced that all international travelers aged two and older, regardless of nationality or vaccination status, are required to show documentation of a negative viral test result taken within one day of the flight's departure to the United States.\nDespite the easing of restrictions on travel to and within Hawai'i, uncertainties remain regarding the impact of vaccination-related travel requirements and increased vaccination availability and uptake on the demand for air travel, including the availability, reliability and effectiveness of vaccines domestically and worldwide, particularly as new variants of the COVID-19 virus have emerged and spread. There can be no assurance whether, at some point, the State of Hawai'i or counties within the state may limit or suspend the ability for travelers to bypass quarantine requirements should the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic worsen. The U.S. government and international governments could also impose, extend or otherwise modify existing travel restrictions on international travel. Additionally, ongoing restrictions or shortages in other sectors of the travel industry, such as hotel or transportation availability, including as a result of vaccination requirements and any associated labor shortages, could negatively impact our operations and affect our ability to satisfy any increased demand we experience. As a result of all the above factors and our results to date, we expect bookings, revenue and results of operations in 2022 to be below to flat\ncompared to 2019 levels. Unpredictability in the demand for air travel as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may result in decreases to existing or anticipated levels of demand, and such decreases could be material to our business. We will continue to assess our routes and schedule in response to changes in demand, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGovernment Support Programs\nThe CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 and provided an estimated $2.2 trillion to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and stimulate the U.S. economy. The assistance included tax relief and government loans, grants and investments for entities in affected industries. The CARES Act provided, among other things: (a) financial relief to passenger air carriers for direct payroll support under the PSP, (b) financial relief in the form of loans and loan guarantees available for operations under the Economic Relief Program (ERP), (c) temporary suspension of certain aviation taxes, (d) temporary deferral of certain employer payroll taxes, and (e) additional Corporate tax benefits.\nThe CARES Act also provided for deferred payment of the employer portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50% of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% due December 31, 2022. Lastly, the CARES Act provided for the carryback of additional NOLs to 2016 and 2017, which will result in tax benefits for those years. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nEconomic Relief Program\nIn September 2020, the Company entered into the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement under the ERP pursuant to which the maximum facility available to be borrowed increased to $622.0 million (the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement). In connection with our entry into the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, we also entered into an ERP Warrant Agreement with the Treasury. On September 25, 2020, we borrowed $45.0 million and issued to the Treasury warrants to purchase up to 380,711 shares of our common stock. We recorded the value of the loan and the warrants on a relative fair value basis as $41.9 million in noncurrent debt and $3.1 million in additional paid in capital, respectively.\nOn February 4, 2021, we repaid in full the $45.0 million loan under the ERP, and in connection with this repayment, terminated the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. The debt extinguishment resulted in the recognition of a loss of $4.0 million, which is reflected in nonoperating income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nPayroll Support Program\nOn April 22, 2020, we entered into a Payroll Support Program agreement (the PSP Agreement) with the Treasury under the CARES Act. In connection with the PSP Agreement, we entered into a Warrant Agreement (the PSP Warrant Agreement) with the Treasury, and we issued a promissory note to the Treasury (the Note). Pursuant to the PSP Agreement, the Treasury provided us with financial assistance, paid in installments, totaling approximately $300.9 million, to be used exclusively for the purpose of continuing to pay employee salaries, wages and benefits. Under the PSP Agreement, we agreed to (i) refrain from conducting involuntary furloughs or reducing employee rates of pay or benefits through September 30, 2020, (ii) limit executive compensation through March 24, 2022 and (iii) suspend payment of dividends and stock repurchases through September 30, 2021. The PSP Agreement also imposes certain Treasury-mandated reporting obligations on us. Finally, we are required to continue to provide air service to markets served prior to March 1, 2020 until March 1, 2022, to the extent determined reasonable and practicable by the DOT and subject to exemptions granted by the DOT to us given the absence of demand for certain of such services.\nThe Note was in the total principal amount of approximately $60.3 million. The Note has a 10-year term and bears interest at a rate per annum equal to 1.00% until the fifth anniversary of April 22, 2020 (the PSP Closing Date), and thereafter bears interest at a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate plus 2.00% until the tenth anniversary of the PSP Closing Date, which interest is payable semi-annually beginning on September 30, 2020. The Note may be prepaid at any time, without penalty, and is subject to customary change of control acceleration provisions and events of default.\nAs compensation to the U.S. government for providing financial relief under the PSP Agreement, and pursuant to the PSP Warrant Agreement, we issued to the Treasury a total of 509,964 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $11.82 per share (the PSP Warrants). The PSP Warrants are non-voting, freely transferable, may be settled as net shares or in cash at our option, expire five years from the date of issuance, and contain registration rights and customary anti-dilution provisions. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nThe CAA 2021 was enacted on December 27, 2020, and provided $15.0 billion for airline employee wages, salaries and benefits under an extension (the PSP Extension) of the Payroll Support Program created under the CARES Act. In January 2021, we entered into a PSP extension agreement with the Treasury (the PSP Extension Agreement). PSP Extension funds are required to be used exclusively for the purpose of continuing to pay employee salaries, wages and benefits, including the payment of lost wages, salaries and benefits to certain returning employees, as defined in the PSP Extension Agreement. Under the PSP Extension Agreement, we agreed to (i) refrain from conducting involuntary furloughs or reducing employee rates of pay or benefits from December 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, (ii) recall any employees who were subject to an involuntary termination or furlough between October 1, 2020 and the date of the PSP Extension Agreement and who elected to return to employment pursuant to a recall notice and to compensate these employees for lost salary, wages and benefits, (iii) limit executive compensation through October 1, 2022, and (iv) suspend payment of dividends and stock repurchases through March 31, 2022. Finally, we are required to continue to provide air service to markets served prior to March 1, 2020 until March 1, 2022, to the extent determined reasonable and practicable by the DOT.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we received $192.7 million in grants, entered into a promissory note with the Treasury (the Extension Note) for approximately $27.8 million and issued to the Treasury warrants to purchase up to a total of 156,341 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $17.78 per share (the PSP Extension Warrants) pursuant to the PSP Extension Agreement. The Extension Note has a 10-year term and bears interest at a rate per annum equal to 1.00% for the first five years and at a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate plus 2.00% for the following five years. We recorded the value of the Extension Note and the PSP Extension Warrants on a relative fair value basis as $23.8 million in noncurrent debt and $4.0 million in additional paid in capital, respectively.\nThe ARP 2021 was enacted on March 11, 2021, and included a second PSP extension, providing an additional $14 billion in grants and loans for airline employee wages, salaries and benefits. In April 2021, we entered into a Payroll Support Program 3 Agreement with the Treasury (PSP3 Agreement), a promissory note (the PSP3 Note), and a Warrant Agreement to purchase up to 87,670 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise of $27.27 (the PSP3 Warrants). The PSP3 Agreement extends (i) the prohibition on conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs through September 2021 or the date on which assistance provided under the agreement is exhausted, whichever is later, (ii) the prohibitions on share repurchases and dividends through September 2022, and (iii) the limitations on executive compensation until April 2023. The terms of the PSP3 Note and PSP3 Warrants are consistent with those of the original PSP and the first PSP Extension. During 2021, we received a total of $179.7 million pursuant to the PSP3 Agreement, consisting of approximately $155.8 million in a grant and $23.9 million in a ten-year loan.\nLoyalty Program and Intellectual Property Financing\nOn February 4, 2021, we completed the private offering (the Notes Offering) by Hawaiian Brand Intellectual Property, Ltd., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Hawaiian (the Brand Issuer), and HawaiianMiles Loyalty, Ltd., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Hawaiian (the Loyalty Issuer and, together with the Brand Issuer, the Issuers) of an aggregate of $1.2 billion principal amount of their 5.750% senior secured notes due 2026 (the Notes). The Notes require interest only payments, payable quarterly in arrears on July 20, October 20, January 20 and April 20 of each year, which began on July 20, 2021.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes, Hawaiian contributed to the Brand Issuer, which is a newly-formed subsidiary structured to be bankruptcy remote, all worldwide rights, owned or purported to be owned, or later developed or acquired and owned or purported to be owned, by Hawaiian or any of its subsidiaries, in and to all intellectual property, including all trademarks, service marks, brand names, designs, and logos that include the word \"Hawaiian\" or any successor brand and the \"hawaiianairlines.com\" domain name and similar domain names or any successor domain names (the Brand IP). The Brand Issuer indirectly granted to Hawaiian an exclusive, worldwide, perpetual and royalty-bearing sublicense to use the Brand IP. Further, Hawaiian contributed to the Loyalty Issuer its rights to certain other collateral owned by Hawaiian, including, to the extent permitted by such agreements or otherwise by operation of law, any of Hawaiian's rights under the HawaiianMiles Agreements and the IP Agreements (each as defined in the Indenture, dated as of February 4, 2021), together with HawaiianMiles program (HawaiianMiles) customer data and certain other intellectual property owned or purported to be owned, or later developed or acquired and owned or purported to be owned, by Hawaiian or any of its subsidiaries (including the Issuers) and required or necessary to operate HawaiianMiles (the Loyalty Program IP) (all such collateral being, the Loyalty Program Collateral). The Loyalty Issuer indirectly granted Hawaiian an exclusive, worldwide, perpetual and royalty-free sub-license to use the Loyalty Program IP.\nThe Notes are redeemable at the option of the Issuers, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, after January 20, 2024 at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture, dated as of February 4, 2021 (the Indenture). In addition, the Notes are redeemable, at the option of the Issuers, at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, prior to January 20, 2024 at a\nprice equal to 100% of their principal amount plus the \"make-whole\" premium described in the Indenture and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. Additionally, from time to time on or prior to January 20, 2024, the Issuers may also redeem up to 40% of the original outstanding principal amount of the Notes with proceeds from any one or more equity offerings of Hawaiian at a redemption price equal to 105.75% of the principal amount of Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. Upon the occurrence of certain mandatory prepayment events and mandatory repurchase offer events, the Issuers will be required to make a prepayment on the Notes, or offer to repurchase the Notes, pro rata, to the extent of any net cash proceeds received in connection with such events, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be prepaid, plus, in some cases, an applicable premium. In addition, upon a change of control of Hawaiian, the Issuers may be required to make an offer to prepay the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the respective principal amounts thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date.\nThe Indenture contains certain covenants that limit the ability of the Issuers, the Cayman Guarantors (as defined below) and, in certain circumstances, Hawaiian to, among other things: (i) make Restricted Payments (as defined in the Indenture), (ii) incur additional indebtedness, (iii) create certain liens on the Loyalty Program Collateral, (iv) sell or otherwise dispose of the Loyalty Program Collateral and (v) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Issuers' assets. The Indenture also requires the Issuers and, in certain circumstances, Hawaiian, to comply with certain affirmative covenants, including depositing the Transaction Revenues (as defined in the Indenture) in collection accounts, with amounts to be distributed for the payment of fees, principal and interest on the Notes pursuant to a payment waterfall described in the Indenture, and certain financial reporting requirements. In addition, the Indenture requires Hawaiian to maintain minimum liquidity at the end of any business day of at least $300.0 million.\nSelected Consolidated Statistical Data\nBelow are the operating statistics we use to measure our operating performance.

We believe this is a useful measure because it better reflects our controllable costs. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.\n(c)Includes applicable taxes and fees.\nOperating Revenue\nOur revenue is derived primarily from transporting passengers on our aircraft. We record passenger revenue when the transportation is provided or when scheduled flights for tickets are expected to expire unused. We measure capacity in terms of available seat miles, which represent the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown. Yield, or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile, is calculated by dividing passenger revenue by RPMs. Typically, we strive to increase passenger revenue primarily by increasing our yield per flight or by filling a higher proportion of available seats, which produces higher operating revenue per available seat mile. Other revenue primarily consists of cargo revenue, incidental services revenue, marketing component related to the sale of frequent flyer miles, and contract services.\nOperating revenue was $1.60 billion, $0.84 billion and $2.83 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Operating revenue was severely impacted beginning in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the unprecedented spread and ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although restrictions have eased and passenger travel demand has improved, demand and capacity continue to remain below pre-pandemic levels.\n2021 vs. 2020\nPassenger Revenue\nPassenger revenue increased by $706.1 million, or 106.2%, in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year. Details of this change are described in the table below: Table 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nvs. Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Passenger\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td>Yield </td> <td> </td> <td>RPMs </td> <td> </td> <td>ASM </td> <td> </td> <td>PRASM </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,300.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>783.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>187.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>128.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International </td> <td>70.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(77.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>151.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(81.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total scheduled </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,370.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>706.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>119.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>91.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDomestic passenger revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $783.3 million, or 151.4%, as compared to 2020, on capacity growth of 128.0%. Our increased passenger revenue was the result of improved demand for passenger travel, predominantly within our North America routes, driven by the relaxation of travel restrictions for travel to and within the state of Hawai'i. Despite these improvements, demand on our domestic network remains below our pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, down 32.3% during 2021 as compared to 2019.\nDuring 2021, we expanded service with the addition of three new U.S. mainland destinations: Austin, Texas, Orlando, Florida, and Ontario, California with service to and from Honolulu, Hawai'i, each of which commenced between March and April 2021. We also expanded service with a daily non-stop flight between Kahului, Hawai'i and Long Beach, California, which commenced in March 2021. Additionally, in March and April 2021, respectively, we announced the recommencement of our thrice-weekly service between Kahului, Hawai'i and Las Vegas, Nevada, and launched four-times-weekly seasonal service between Kahului, Hawai'i and Phoenix, Arizona, both of which commenced in May 2021.\nInternational passenger revenue decreased $77.2 million, or 52.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020, as a result of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continued restrictions in place for international travel. Although we recommenced scheduled international passenger flights on a limited basis beginning in late 2020, customer demand across our international network remains depressed given government travel restrictions, particularly as new variants of the COVID-19 virus have emerged and spread. We expect to see depressed international demand through at least the first quarter of 2022 because of the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, with improvement in our international markets expected to lag behind domestic demand recovery until government travel restrictions begin to lift and customer demand starts to return.\nOther Operating Revenue\nOther operating revenue increased by $45.7 million, or 25.4%, in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to reductions in cargo and loyalty program revenue that occurred in the second half of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCargo revenue increased $19.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year due to increased volume and yield as a result of the unfavorable impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on 2020 results; however cargo revenue was down $1.1 million compared to 2019. Loyalty revenue, primarily comprised of brand and marketing performance obligations, increased $17.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior\nyear, as a result of increased credit card spend and new cardholder acquisitions, but down $3.0 million as compared to 2019. Other components in Other operating revenue include, but are not limited to, ground handling and other freight services which collectively, increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 by approximately $8.5 million as compared to the prior year, primarily attributed to increased volumes and contract service operations.\nOperating Expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, total operating expense increased $0.2 billion or 12.5% to $1.7 billion as compared to 2020. Increases (decreases) in operating expenses are detailed below.

We define economic fuel expense as GAAP fuel expense plus (gains)/losses realized through actual cash (receipts)/payments received from or paid to hedge counterparties for fuel hedge derivative contracts settled in the period inclusive of costs related to hedging premiums.\nEconomic fuel expense is calculated as follows: Table 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except per-gallon amounts) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft fuel expense, including taxes and delivery </td> <td>$ </td> <td>363,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized losses on settlement of fuel derivative instruments </td> <td>165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(98.2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic fuel expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>363,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>170,398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel gallons consumed </td> <td>179,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106,225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic fuel costs per gallon </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.02 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, for additional discussion of our jet fuel costs and related derivative program.\nWages and benefits\nWages and benefits expense increased by $69.5 million, or 11.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior period. Actions taken by the Company in 2020, in response to decreased passenger travel demand attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, had a significant impact on wages and benefits during the prior period. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, improving domestic travel demand led to the ramp up of domestic operations, notably amongst our front-line employees. These actions, combined with scheduled contractual wage increases, resulted in higher wages and benefits during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020. We expect that wages and benefits will increase during the first quarter of 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, as a result of the ramp up of our domestic operations and contractual wage increases.\nMaintenance materials and repairs\nMaintenance materials and repairs increased $48.5 million, or 39.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily attributed to increased utilization of our aircraft commensurate with the ramp up of our operations during the period, as discussed above. We expect maintenance, materials and repairs expense to increase in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, as we continue to rebuild operational capacity combined with scheduled heavy maintenance events and inflationary pressures.\nAircraft and passenger servicing\nAircraft and passenger servicing expense increased by $47.7 million, or 82.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily due to increased capacity and passengers flown, as discussed above. We expect aircraft and passenger servicing expense to increase in the first quarter of 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, as we continue to rebuild operational capacity.\nCommissions and other selling expenses\nCommissions and other selling expenses increased by $26.2 million, or 56.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year. The increase in commissions and other selling expense was primarily related to the increase in operational capacity and passenger travel, as discussed above. We expect commissions and other selling expense to increase in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 as we continue to rebuild our operational capacity.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $13.4 million, or 8.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year. The decrease is attributed to (a) the reclassification of approximately $29.5 million of ATR and commercial real estate assets to assets held for sale and (b) a reduction in capital expenditures during 2021 and 2020 below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels while other existing fixed assets have fully depreciated.\nOther rentals and landing fees\nOther rentals and landing fees increased by $43.0 million, or 58.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year. A portion of our other rentals and landing fees are variable in nature and are dependent on factors such as the number of departures and passengers. The increase in landing fees and other rents is attributed to increased operations as discussed above. We expect other rentals and landing fees expense to increase in the first quarter of 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, as we rebuild operational capacity and passenger travel demand continues to improve, and due to inflationary pressures and increased infrastructure projects at various airports in which we operate, the costs of which are passed onto airlines.\nSpecial items\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we announced the termination of our 'Ohana by Hawaiian operations, which operated under a capacity purchase agreement (CPA) with a third-party carrier. We reclassified approximately $23.6 million to assets held for sale and recognized a one-time expense of $6.4 million to write-down the asset group to fair value. Additionally, we recorded a charge of approximately $2.6 million for the early termination of the CPA.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 we recognized approximately $184.1 million of special items expense, comprised of the following:\n\u2022In March 2020, we reached an agreement in principle with our flight attendants, represented by the AFA, on a new five-year contract that runs through April 2025. On April 3, 2020, we received notification from the AFA that a collective bargaining agreement (the CBA) was ratified by its members. The ratified CBA provides for, among other things, a ratification payment to be paid over a one-year term, increased medical cost sharing, improved pay scales, and a one-time medical savings contribution to eligible flight attendants upon retirement. During the first quarter of 2020, we recorded a $23.5 million ratification bonus, of which $20.2 million was related to service prior to January 1, 2020, and recognized this as a special item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The remaining $3.3 million was recorded as a component of wages and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\u2022During the first quarter of 2020, the adverse economic impact and declining passenger demand attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic drove our stock price to 52-week lows and significantly reduced future cash flow projections. We qualitatively assessed that an impairment loss may have been incurred as of March 31, 2020 and performed an interim test of the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We determined that the estimated fair value of our one reporting unit was less than its carrying value and that the deficit between fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded the amount of goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, leading to the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge of $106.7 million in the first quarter of 2020.\n\u2022During the second quarter of 2020, we recorded special items of $34.0 million comprised of: (a) an impairment charge of $27.5 million to mark down our ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleets to fair value; (b) an impairment charge of $3.4 million to mark down our commercial real estate assets to fair value; and (c) an approximately $3.1 million write-off for discontinued software-related projects as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022During the third quarter of 2020, we announced and completed voluntary separation programs across each of our labor groups providing for one-time severance payments, the establishment of health reimbursement accounts and other benefits. Additionally, we announced involuntary separation and temporary leave programs, the majority of which were effective October 1, 2020. We recorded $17.8 million in severance and benefits as an operating special item and $5.7 million related to special termination benefits and curtailment loss as a nonoperating special item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\u2022During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded long-lived asset impairment of approximately $5.4 million, comprised of an additional write-down of our ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleet of approximately $4.9 million as a result of ongoing market uncertainty attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also wrote off of approximately $0.5 million in capitalized software projects that were permanently suspended in response to the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we recorded $0.3 million in additional costs for the finalization of the separation programs discussed above.\nGovernment grant recognition\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we received $372.4 million and $300.9 million in federal payroll support payments, of which $320.6 million and $240.6 million, respectively, was in the form of a grant. These funds were required to be used exclusively for the payment of employee wages, salaries and benefits. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized approximately $320.6 million and $240.6 million, respectively, as contra-expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2021, we utilized all funds received under the federal payroll support programs to pay salaries and wages and reinstate employees previously impacted by involuntary leaves and terminations.\nOther expense\nOther expense increased by $9.0 million, or 8.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributed to our ramp up of operations and increase in technology projects, including personnel-related expenditures for crew travel, professional and technical services, and other miscellaneous expenditures. We expect other expense to increase during the first quarter of 2022 as we continue to rebuild operational capacity.\nNonoperating expense, net\nNet nonoperating expense increased by $50.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year. The increase in expense was primarily attributed to an increase in interest expense as a result of the $1.2 billion loyalty and intellectual property financing completed in February 2021 combined with the recognition of approximately $38.9 million in losses related to the extinguishment of long-term debt. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. These losses were offset by approximately $27.6 million in unrealized gains associated with our Japanese Yen-denominated debt as a result of favorable exchange rates.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective tax rate was 21.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with 27.0% for the prior year. The effective tax rate represents a blend of federal and state taxes and includes the impact of the $4.4 million valuation allowance reserve recorded against state deferred tax assets. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, we took various actions to increase liquidity and strengthen our financial position. For discussion on the actions we took in 2020, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 12, 2021. Refer to Cash Flow and Uses of Liquidity section for discussion of 2021 financing activities.\nCash, cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash) and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared to $0.9 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by approximately $902.9 million as compared to $113.93 million as of December 31, 2020. Approximately $631.2 million of our current liabilities relate to our advanced ticket sales and frequent flyer deferred revenue.\nWe cannot assure you that the assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements will be correct because we have never experienced such an unprecedented event impacting global travel and, as a consequence, our ability to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain. In addition, the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain. However, we expect to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months with cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash), short-term investments and cash flows from operations. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and financing arrangements.\nCash Flow and Uses of Liquidity\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $251.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $310.7 million in the prior year. Our operating cash flows are impacted by the following factors:\nAdvanced Ticket Sales. We sell tickets for air travel and record the receipt on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability. The air traffic liability typically increases during the winter and spring months as advanced ticket sales grow prior to the summer and fall peak travel seasons and decreases upon utilization during these seasons. The ongoing impact of COVID-19 has resulted in a lower level of advanced bookings than historically experienced, which has impacted seasonal trends. As discussed above, we noted marked improvements in air travel demand in 2021, as compared to 2020; however, demand (measured in passengers flown) and revenue remain well below 2019 levels. The ongoing impact and severity of the reduction in travel demand due to COVID-19 and related variants are uncertain, as described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nFuel. Fuel expense represented approximately 21.6% of our total operating expense in 2021. The market price for jet fuel is volatile, which can impact the comparability of our cash flows from operations. We expect fuel consumption to increase in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 as we continue to ramp up operational capacity.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Funding. We sponsor a defined pension plan covering eligible pilots and retirees. This plan is closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals. Additionally, we sponsor four unfunded defined benefit postretirement medical and life insurance plans and a separate plan to administer the pilots' disability benefits. As of December 31, 2021, the excess of the projected benefit obligations over the fair value of plan assets was approximately $168.4 million. We contributed $4.1 million to our disability plan in both 2021 and 2020.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we were not required to, and did not make, contributions to our defined benefit pension plan. Future funding requirements for our defined benefit and other postretirement plans are dependent upon many factors such as interest rates, funded status, applicable regulatory requirements and the level and timing of asset returns. Given available funding credits in the defined benefit plan and funding status, we do not anticipate requiring any cash contributions to our defined benefit plan between 2022 through 2024. For our pilot's disability plan, we anticipate annual contributions to the plan of approximately $4.0 million between 2022 and 2026.\nGovernment Support Programs. Operating cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 included $320.6 million and $240.6 million in proceeds received as part of the government payroll support programs, all of which was utilized in each respective year to offset eligible payroll and payroll-related costs. As of December 31, 2021, all funds were utilized towards their stated purpose.\nOperating Lease Obligations. As described further in Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2021 we had a total of $502.5 million of minimum operating lease obligations. These minimum lease payments range from approximately $59.9 million to $104.5 million on an annual basis over the next five years.\nOther Commitments. We have certain purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services, including, but not limited to aircraft maintenance, IT, capacity purchases, and reservations. Total contractual obligations do not include long-term contracts where the commitment is variable in nature (with no minimum guarantee), such as aircraft maintenance deposits due under operating leases and fees due under certain other agreements such as aircraft maintenance power-by-the-hour, computer reservation systems and credit card processing agreements, or when the agreements contain short-term cancellation provisions. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $4.8 billion of such obligations, which range from approximately $439.8 million to $1.7 billion on an annual basis over the next five years.\nInvesting Activities\nShort-Term Investments. During 2021, we acquired approximately $897.8 million (net of sales) in short-term investments, a portion of which was funded from proceeds we obtained through our financing transactions. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these investments.\nCapital Expenditures. Our capital expenditures are primarily related to the purchase of aircraft, fleet modifications and technology enhancements. Our capital expenditures decreased to $39.3 million in 2021 as compared to $105.3 million in 2020, primarily as a result of the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and our focus on strengthening our financial position.\nWe expect that we will have capital expenditures between approximately $105 million and $125 million in 2022, primarily for aircraft, including advance deposit payments for future aircraft deliveries and aircraft modifications, along with facility upgrades and technology enhancements. We expect that the capital expenditures in 2022 will be funded through available liquidity and cash flows from operations. We have committed to future aircraft purchases, with scheduled deliveries between 2023 and 2026.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had the following capital commitments consisting of firm aircraft and engine orders and purchase rights:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft Type </td> <td>Firm\nOrders </td> <td> </td> <td>Purchase\nRights </td> <td> </td> <td>Expected Delivery Dates </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A321neo aircraft </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>B787-9 aircraft </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Between 2023 and 2026 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General Electric GEnx spare engines: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>B787-9 spare engines </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Between 2023 and 2025 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommitted expenditures for these aircraft, engines, and related flight equipment are approximately $92 million in 2022, $418 million in 2023, $503 million in 2024, $411 million in 2025, and $234 million in 2026.\nIn October 2020, we entered into an amendment to our Boeing 787-9 purchase agreement, which changed the scheduled delivery of each aircraft and related engines to between 2022 and 2026. In December 2021, we received notification of further delivery delays, and we have agreed to defer delivery of our first two aircraft from the scheduled delivery date at the end of 2022, to the first half of 2023. The remainder of the B787-9 delivery schedule has not changed. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nIn order to complete the purchase of these aircraft and fund related costs, we may need to secure acceptable financing. We have backstop financing available from aircraft and engine manufacturers, subject to certain customary conditions. Financing may be necessary to satisfy our capital commitments for firm order aircraft and other related capital expenditures. We can provide no\nassurance that any financing not already in place for aircraft and spare engine deliveries will be available to us on acceptable terms when necessary or at all.\nFinancing Activities\nDebt and finance lease obligations. As discussed above, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that began in early 2020, we took actions to shore up our liquidity and financial position. In February 2021, we also completed the issuance of $1.2 billion in 5.75% senior secured notes, which are collateralized by our loyalty program and intellectual property. The Notes require quarterly interest payments and mature in January 2026. See above and Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the offering.\nAs our liquidity stabilized following the offering, we repaid approximately $440.9 million in future debt obligations during the year ended December 31, 2021 as follows:\n\u2022In February 2021, we (a) paid in full the $45.0 million ERP loan issued pursuant to the CARES Act, and in connection with such repayment, terminated the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. The warrants remain outstanding pursuant to the terms of the agreement, and (b) repaid the $235.0 million outstanding balance drawn on our revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility matures in December 2022 and remains available to draw upon at a future date in the event the need arises.\n\u2022In October 2021, we repurchased approximately $160.9 million of our outstanding 7.375% Series 2020-1A Pass Through Certificates due 2027 and 11.250% Series 2020-1B Pass Through Certificates due 2025, and incurred a $34.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which is recorded in loss on extinguishment of debt in non-operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIn addition, we received approximately $372.4 million through government payroll support programs discussed above, of which approximately $51.7 million was issued as a Note due at maturity in 2031.\nAs of December 31, 2021 our total debt was $1.8 billion, compared to $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nFuture Debt Obligations. As described in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2021, scheduled maturities of our debt in 2022 and 2023 were $98.7 million and $63.7 million, with scheduled maturities from 2024 through 2026 of $61.6 million, $79.1 million, and $1,347.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, scheduled maturities after 2026 aggregate to $188.3 million. In addition, we are obligated to make periodic interest payments at fixed and variable rates, depending on the terms of the applicable debt agreements. Based on applicable interest rates and scheduled debt maturities as of December 31, 2021, these interest obligations total $87.0 million in 2022, $84.0 million in 2023, $82.2 million in 2024, $80.1 million in 2025, $24.3 million in 2026, and $11.7 million thereafter.\nFinance Lease Obligations. As described further in Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2021, we had a total of $125.1 million of minimum finance lease obligations. These minimum lease payments range from approximately $11.3 million to $29.5 million on an annual basis over the next five years.\nIssuance of Equity. In December 2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the Equity Distribution Agreement) with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, BNP Paribas Securities Corp. and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (the Managers) relating to the issuance and sale of up to 5.0 million shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we sold 2.9 million shares pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement at an average price of $24.47 per share, with net proceeds totaling approximately $68.1 million. As of March 5, 2021, we sold all of the 5.0 million shares authorized under the Equity Distribution Agreement, at an average price of $22.46 per share, with net proceeds of approximately $109.3 million.\nReturn to Shareholders. In November 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock over a two-year period through December 2020. On March 18, 2020, we indefinitely suspended all repurchases under the approved repurchase plan in connection with our receipt of financial assistance under federal Payroll Support Programs, which restricts us from repurchasing shares and making dividend payments until September 30, 2022. We spent $7.5 million to repurchase and retire approximately 0.3 million shares of our common stock in open market transactions during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following table displays information with respect to our stock repurchase programs as of December 31, 2021:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except repurchase price) </td> <td> </td> <td>Share Repurchase Authorization\n(in '000s) </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average Repurchase Price </td> <td> </td> <td>Planned Completion Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Authorization Remaining\n(in '000s) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>April 2015 Program </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25.75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>April 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>Completed April 2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>April 2017 Program </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39.85 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>May 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Completed December 2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 2017 Program </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Completed December 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 2018 Program </td> <td> </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Suspended </td> <td> </td> <td>Suspended </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe declared and paid cash dividends of $0.0 million, $5.5 million, and $22.8 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our receipt of financial assistance under federal Payroll Support Programs precludes us from making any further dividend payments until September 30, 2022.\nUndrawn Lines of Credit. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $235.0 million undrawn and available under our revolving credit facility that matures in December 2022. We are currently exploring options to renew our revolving credit facility.\nCredit Card Holdbacks. Under our bank-issued credit card processing agreements, proceeds from advance ticket sales may be held back to serve as collateral to cover any possible chargebacks or other disputed charges that may occur. These holdbacks, are reported as restricted cash in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no holdbacks held with our credit card processors. In the event of a material adverse change in our business, the holdback could increase to an amount up to 100% of the applicable credit card activity for all unflown tickets, which would also result in an increase in the required level of restricted cash. If we are unable to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate the increase in the restriction of cash, it could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nCovenants. We are in compliance with covenants in our debt and lease agreements at December 31, 2021.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe believe the disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures is useful information to readers of our financial statements because:\n\u2022We believe it is the basis by which we are evaluated by industry analysts and investors;\n\u2022These measures are often used in management and Board of Directors' decision making analysis;\n\u2022It improves a reader's ability to compare our results to those of other airlines; and\n\u2022It is consistent with how we present information in our quarterly earnings press releases.\nSee table below for reconciliation between GAAP consolidated net income to adjusted consolidated net income, including per share amounts (in thousands unless otherwise indicated). The adjustments are described below:\n\u2022During the year ended December 31, 2020, the effective tax rate included a tax benefit of $45.4 million resulting from the rate differential between the prevailing tax rate of 21% during the years that generated the NOLs and the previous tax rate of 35% that was in effect during the years to which NOLs were carried back as a result of the enactment of the CARES Act. This benefit is attributed to the enactment of the CARES Act and we believe that exclusion of this tax benefit provides investors comparability of results between periods.\n\u2022During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized $320.6 million in contra-expense related to grant proceeds from the federal payroll support programs as compared to $240.6 million recognized in the prior year. The grant proceeds were recognized in proportion to estimated wages and benefits expense over the period the grant covers. We utilized all proceeds under the federal payroll support programs as of December 31, 2021.\n\u2022Losses on the extinguishment of debt are excluded to allow investors to better analyze our core operational performance and more readily compare our results to other results in the periods presented below.\n\u2022Changes in fair value of derivative contracts, net of tax, are based on market prices for open contracts as of the end of the reporting period. This adjustment includes the unrealized gains and losses on fuel and interest rate derivatives (not designated as hedges) that will settle in future periods and the reversal of prior period unrealized amounts. Excluding the impact of these derivative adjustments allows investors to analyze our core operational performance and compare our results to other airlines in the periods presented below.\n\u2022Changes in fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts, net of tax, are based on market prices for open contracts as of the end of the reporting period. This adjustment includes the unrealized amounts of foreign currency derivatives (not designated as hedges) that will settle in future periods and the reversal of prior period unrealized amounts. We believe that excluding the impact of these derivative adjustments helps investors analyze our operational performance and compare our results to other airlines in the periods presented below.\n\u2022Change in unrealized losses (gains) on foreign debt are based on fluctuations in foreign exchanges rates related to foreign-denominated debt agreements. We believe that excluding the impact of these amounts helps investors analyze our operational performance and compare our results to other airlines in the periods presented below.\nSpecial Items\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 we recognized approximately $184.1 million of special items expense, comprised of the following:\n\u2022During the first quarter of 2020, we recognized $126.9 million of special items in the Consolidated Statements of Operation, comprised of the following:\n\u25e6On April 3, 2020, we received notification from the AFA that the CBA was ratified by its members. The ratified CBA provided for, among other things, a ratification payment, payable over twelve months. We recorded a $23.5 million ratification bonus, of which $20.2 million related to service prior to January 1, 2020, and was recorded as a special item.\n\u25e6We recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $106.7 million. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n\u2022During the second quarter of 2020, we recognized a charge of $34.0 million associated with the impairment of certain of our long-lived assets. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n\u2022During the third quarter of 2020, we announced and completed voluntary separation programs across each of our labor groups providing for one-time severance payments, the establishment of health reimbursement accounts and other benefits. Additionally, we announced involuntary separation programs, the majority of which were effective October 1, 2020. We recorded $17.5 million in severance and benefits as an operating special item and $5.7 million related to special termination benefits and curtailment loss as a nonoperating special item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\u2022During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded long-lived asset impairment of approximately $5.4 million, comprised of an additional write-down of our ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleet of approximately $4.9 million as a result of ongoing market uncertainty attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also wrote off approximately $0.5 million in capitalized software projects that were permanently suspended in response to the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we recorded $0.3 million in additional costs for the finalization of the voluntary and involuntary separation programs discussed above.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we recognized approximately $9.0 million of special items expense, comprised of the following:\n\u2022During the second quarter of 2021, we announced the termination of our 'Ohana by Hawaiian operations, which operated under a CPA with a third-party carrier. The asset group met the requirements for, and was reclassified as Held-for-Sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We fair valued the asset group resulting in the write-down of approximately $6.4 million. Additionally, we recorded an early termination charge associated with the CPA of approximately $2.6 million.\nWe believe that excluding such special items helps investors analyze our operational performance and compare our results to other airlines in the periods presented below.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Diluted Per Share </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Diluted Per Share </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Diluted Per Share </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except for per share data) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP net income (loss), as reported </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(144,773) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2.85) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(510,935) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11.08) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>223,984 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.71 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted for: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CARES Act - carryback of additional NOLs </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45,416) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.99) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government grant recognition </td> <td>(320,645) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.32) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(240,648) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.22) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt </td> <td>38,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in fair value of fuel derivative contracts </td> <td>(382) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.01) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,105) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.05) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,694) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.13) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized loss (gain) on non-designated fx positions </td> <td>(1,352) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.03) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized loss (gain) on foreign debt </td> <td>(27,593) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.54) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.02 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of aircraft </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,948) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.04) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special items </td> <td>8,983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184,111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.99 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonoperating special items </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax effect of adjustments </td> <td>63,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.04 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(383,432) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7.55) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(550,973) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11.96) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>218,883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.60 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM)\nWe have separately listed in the table below our fuel costs per ASM and non-GAAP unit costs, excluding fuel and special items.

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those accounting policies and accounting estimates that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and that potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below. See the summary of significant accounting policies included in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the application of these estimates and other accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nPassenger revenue. We record direct passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on Hawaiian as passenger revenue when the transportation is provided or when scheduled flights for tickets are expected to expire unused.\nThe value of unused passenger tickets is included in current liabilities as Air traffic liability. Prior to the second quarter of 2020, non-refundable tickets sold and credits issued generally expired 13 months from the date of issuance or flight, as applicable. In April 2020, we announced the waiver of certain change fees and extended ticket validity for up to 24 months for (a) tickets issued between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 and (b) tickets issued prior to March 1, 2020 for original travel between March 1, 2020 and February 28, 2021. In December 2021, we announced the further extension of ticket validity to December 31, 2022, which also includes all Main Cabin and First Class passenger tickets purchased in 2021. We record an estimate of breakage revenue on the scheduled flight date for tickets that will expire unused. These estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results, available market information, forecasted trends and the extension of the expiration date for certain tickets impacted by COVID-19. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized approximately $48.3 million in advanced ticket breakage. The primary assumption utilized in our calculation of advanced ticket breakage involves an estimate of future breakage patterns, which is based on a combination of historical activity and expected customer behavior. A 10% change in this rate represents a change of approximately $4.8 million in advanced ticket breakage. Given the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on actual results and its continued impact on travel demand, we continue to monitor customers' travel behavior and may adjust our estimates in the future.\nTicket change fees are recorded in Air traffic liability and recognized when the related transportation is provided. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized approximately $4.8 million and $11.3 million, respectively in ticket change fee revenue.\nFrequent flyer revenue. HawaiianMiles, Hawaiian's frequent flyer travel award program, provides a variety of awards to program members based on accumulated mileage. ASC 606 requires us to account for miles earned by passengers in the HawaiianMiles program through flight activity as a component of the passenger revenue ticket transaction at the estimated selling price of the miles. Ticket consideration received is allocated between the performance obligations, primarily travel and miles earned by passengers. The allocated value of the miles is deferred until the free travel or other award is used by the passenger, at which time it is included in passenger revenue. The value of the ticket used in the determination of the estimated selling price is based on the historical value of equivalent flights to those provided for loyalty awards and the related miles redeemed to obtain that award adjusted for breakage or fulfillment. The equivalent ticket value (ETV) includes a fulfillment discount (breakage) to reflect the value of the award ticket over the number of miles that, based on historical experience, will be needed to obtain the award. On a quarterly basis, we calculate the ETV by analyzing the fares of similar tickets for the prior 12 months, considering cabin class and geographic region.\nWe also sell mileage credits to companies participating in our frequent flyer program. These contracts generally include multiple performance obligations, including the transportation that will ultimately be provided when the mileage credits are redeemed and marketing and brand related activities.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we amended our partnership with Barclaycard US, Hawaiian's co-branded credit card partner. Management determined that the amendment should be accounted for as a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract under ASC 606 and the relative selling price was determined for each performance obligation of the new agreement. The new agreement continues through 2024 and includes improved economics and enhanced product offerings for our Barclay's co-branded cardholders. The amended agreement did not change, and includes the following performance obligations; (i) transportation that will ultimately be provided when mileage credits are redeemed (transportation), (ii) the Hawaiian Airlines brand and access to its members lists (collectively, brand performance), (iii) marketing, and (iv) airline benefits to cardholders, including discounts and anniversary travel benefits, baggage waivers and inflight purchase credits. We determined the relative fair value of each performance obligation by estimating the selling prices of the deliverables by\nconsidering discounted cash flows using multiple inputs and assumptions, including: (1) the expected number of miles to be awarded and redeemed; (2) the estimated weighted average equivalent ticket value, adjusted by a fulfillment discount; (3) the estimated total annual cardholder spend; (4) an estimated royalty rate for the Hawaiian portfolio; and (5) the expected use of each of the airline benefits. The overall consideration received is allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative selling prices.\nThe transportation performance obligation is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when the transportation is provided. The value to the financial institution is provided each time a new cardholder chooses the Hawaiian branded credit card and each time a cardholder chooses to use the co-branded credit card. Therefore, we recognize revenue for the brand performance obligation as members use their co-brand credit card and the resulting mileage credits are issued to them, which best correlates with our performance toward satisfying the obligation.\nAccounting for frequent flyer revenue involves the use of various techniques to estimate revenue. To determine the total estimated transaction price, we forecast future credit card activity based on historical data. The relative selling price is determined using management's estimated standalone selling price of each performance obligation. The objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis. Accordingly, we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including, but not limited to, discounted cash flows, brand value, number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed. We estimate the selling price of miles using an ETV adjusted for a fulfillment discount as described above.\nIn April 2021, we announced the elimination of our HawaiianMiles expiration policy, effective April 1, 2021. Prior to this change in policy, miles expired after 18 months of member account inactivity. We review our breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns (e.g., credit card and non-credit card holders). Our estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment. Current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy, or to program rules and program could affect the estimated value of a mile. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including changes to our ticket validity and exchange policies, management continues to monitor customers' travel behavior and may adjust its estimates in the future as additional information becomes available. We do not believe that the change in expiration policy will have a material impact on our accounting estimates and will continue to evaluate the impact of this change as additional information becomes available.\nPension and Other Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits\nThe calculation of pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit expenses and its corresponding liabilities require the use of significant assumptions, including the assumed discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, expected mortality rates of the plan participants, and the expected health care cost trend rate. Changes in these assumptions will impact the expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience may differ from these assumptions.\nThe significant assumptions as of December 31, 2021 are as follows:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate to determine projected benefit obligation </td> <td>2.98 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets </td> <td>6.29 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>^ </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Postretirement: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate to determine projected benefit obligation </td> <td>2.99 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected health care cost trend rate: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Initial </td> <td>6.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ultimate </td> <td>4.75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years to reach ultimate trend rate </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Disability: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate to determine projected benefit obligation </td> <td>3.03 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on plan assets </td> <td>4.28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>^ </td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/A Not Applicable\n^ Expected return on plan assets used to determine the net periodic benefit expense for 2022 is 6.06% for the pension plans and 4.35% for the disability plan.\nThe expected long-term rate of return assumption is developed by evaluating input from the trustee managing the plans' assets, including the trustee's review of asset class return expectations by several consultants and economists, as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets, which is based on our goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels. The Retirement Plan for Pilots of Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. and the Pilot's Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association Disability and Survivor's Benefit Plan strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from any one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. We believe that our long-term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation. We periodically review our actual asset allocation and rebalance the pension plan's investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return by 100 basis points will have the following effects on our estimated 2022 pension and disability benefit expense recorded in wages and benefits and nonoperating expense: Table 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>100 Basis Point Decrease </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in estimated 2022 pension expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in estimated 2022 disability benefit expense </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe determine the appropriate discount rate for each of our plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due. The pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and future expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate by 100 basis points would have the following effects:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>100 Basis Point Decrease </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in pension obligation as of December 31, 2021 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in other postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2021 </td> <td>21.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in estimated 2022 pension expense (operating and nonoperating) </td> <td>(0.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in estimated 2022 other postretirement benefit expense (operating and nonoperating) </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience taking into account current and expected market conditions. Changes in the assumed current health care cost trend rate by year by 100 basis points would have the following annual effects:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>100 Basis Point Increase </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in other postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2021 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in estimated 2022 other postretirement benefit expense (operating and nonoperating) </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>100 Basis Point Decrease </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in other postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2021 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in estimated 2022 other postretirement benefit expense (operating and nonoperating) </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets used in operations, consisting principally of aircraft and other non-aircraft equipment, are classified as property and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and have a carrying value of approximately $2.0 billion at December 31, 2021. We review long-lived assets used in operations for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying value. To determine whether impairment exists for aircraft used in operations, assets are grouped at the fleet-type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and future cash flows are estimated based on projections of capacity, passenger mile yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors. If, at any time, management determines the net carrying value of an asset is not recoverable, the amount is reduced to its fair value during the period in which such determination is made. Any changes in the estimated useful lives of these assets will be accounted for prospectively.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 we identified indicators of impairment of our long-lived assets. During the second quarter of 2020, it was determined that the net carrying values of our ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleets and assets held under our commercial real estate subsidiary were not recoverable through the generation of future undiscounted cash flows as of June 30, 2020. We estimated the fair value of our ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleets using a third-party valuation, which takes into consideration market pricing information, among other factors, and resulted in a $27.5 million impairment charge. We estimated the fair value of our commercial real-estate entity using a combination of a market and income-based approach, which estimates fair value based upon projections of future revenues, expenses, and cash flows discounted to its present value, which resulted in a $3.4 million impairment charge. The principal assumptions used in our discounted cash flow analysis consisted of (a) the long-term projections of future financial performance and (b) the weighted-average cost of capital of market participants, adjusted for the risk attributable to us and the industry in which we operate.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded long-lived asset impairment of approximately $5.4 million, comprised of an additional write-down of our ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleet of $4.9 million as a result of ongoing market uncertainty attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also wrote off of approximately $0.5 million in capitalized software projects that were permanently suspended in response to the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we announced the termination of our 'Ohana by Hawaiian operations, which utilizes the ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleet, and was operated under a capacity purchase agreement (CPA) with a third-party carrier. Following the termination of the operations, which were temporarily suspended in late 2020, management committed to a plan of sale and wrote-down the related assets by approximately $6.4 million to fair value, less cost to sell, and classified approximately $23.4 million as assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2021, management committed to a plan to sell certain commercial real-estate assets held by one of the Company's subsidiaries. Management fair valued the assets, less the cost to sell, which did not result in a write-down to the asset group, and as of December 31, 2021, reclassified approximately $6.1 million as assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management expects to complete the sale of the above referenced assets within 12 months from the original designation date, and will continue to monitor the asset groups for potential impairment.\nIn addition, we will continue to monitor the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and will continue to evaluate our current fleet and other long-lived assets for impairment accordingly.\nIncome Tax Valuation Allowance\nWe periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets and establish valuation allowances if it is not likely we will realize our deferred income tax assets. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, our deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical financial results, our industry's historically cyclical financial results and potential current and future tax planning strategies. We cannot presently determine when we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to realize all of our state deferred tax assets. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a valuation allowance of $14.1 million and $9.6 million, respectively, against our deferred tax assets. If we determine that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the remainder of our deferred income tax assets, we will reverse our valuation allowance (in full or in part), resulting in an income tax benefit in the period such a determination is made.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the Company and its operations and is focused on our 2021 and 2020 financial results, including comparisons of year-over-year performance between these years. Discussion and analysis of our 2019 fiscal year, as well as the year-over-year comparison of our 2020 financial performance to 2019, is located in Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 12, 2021.\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections of future events. However, our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein as a result of the risks that we face, including but not limited to those risks stated in the \"Risk Factors\" section of this report. In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe widespread and unprecedented impact of COVID-19, along with the resulting restrictions on travel and every day activities by local, state, federal, and international governments, significantly reduced air travel demand beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and through 2021.\nThe Safe Travels Hawai'i program was enacted to help control the spread of COVID-19 by enforcing quarantines and pre-travel testing requirements. In June 2021, the Safe Travels Hawai'i program was updated to remove restrictions on travel within the state of Hawai'i, and to permit travelers who were fully vaccinated in the state of Hawai'i to bypass testing or quarantine requirements with proof of vaccination when traveling into the state. In July 2021, all U.S. domestic travelers who were fully vaccinated in the United States also were permitted to bypass pre-travel testing or quarantine requirements with proof of vaccination when entering the state starting the 15th day following completion of their vaccination. In September 2021, both the City and County of Honolulu and the County of Maui enacted programs that impose certain vaccination and testing requirements on employees and customers of restaurants, bars, gyms and other similar establishments, with limited exceptions.\nThe rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations, along with the easing of restrictions in various locations, led to improved domestic travel demand during 2021; however, our passenger revenue was down approximately 47.2% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2019. Restrictions on travel to and from various international locations (including those within our network) remain in effect, continuing to suppress international travel demand, with revenue down 89.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2019. We have continued to evolve throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, building back our network where demand allowed, predominantly within our domestic network, while preparing for the return of other markets as restrictions ease. During 2021, we increased capacity (as measured in ASMs) by approximately 91.5% as compared to 2020; however, capacity in 2021 was down approximately 57.6% as compared to 2019. During the first quarter of 2022, we anticipate capacity will be down between 10% to 13%, as compared to the same period in 2019.\nDuring 2021, our domestic network accounted for approximately 94.0% of total passenger revenue. We continue to monitor developments relating to restrictions on international travel by both the U.S. and international governments, including by the government of Japan, which represents a large percentage of our international revenue. The emergence of new variants of the COVID-19 virus, including the Delta and Omicron variants, continues to impact the rules and regulations governing international travel. In December 2021, President Biden announced that all international travelers aged two and older, regardless of nationality or vaccination status, are required to show documentation of a negative viral test result taken within one day of the flight's departure to the United States.\nDespite the easing of restrictions on travel to and within Hawai'i, uncertainties remain regarding the impact of vaccination-related travel requirements and increased vaccination availability and uptake on the demand for air travel, including the availability, reliability and effectiveness of vaccines domestically and worldwide, particularly as new variants of the COVID-19 virus have emerged and spread. There can be no assurance whether, at some point, the State of Hawai'i or counties within the state may limit or suspend the ability for travelers to bypass quarantine requirements should the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic worsen. The U.S. government and international governments could also impose, extend or otherwise modify existing travel restrictions on international travel. Additionally, ongoing restrictions or shortages in other sectors of the travel industry, such as hotel or transportation availability, including as a result of vaccination requirements and any associated labor shortages, could negatively impact our operations and affect our ability to satisfy any increased demand we experience. As a result of all the above factors and our results to date, we expect bookings, revenue and results of operations in 2022 to be below to flat\ncompared to 2019 levels. Unpredictability in the demand for air travel as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may result in decreases to existing or anticipated levels of demand, and such decreases could be material to our business. We will continue to assess our routes and schedule in response to changes in demand, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGovernment Support Programs\nThe CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 and provided an estimated $2.2 trillion to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and stimulate the U.S. economy. The assistance included tax relief and government loans, grants and investments for entities in affected industries. The CARES Act provided, among other things: (a) financial relief to passenger air carriers for direct payroll support under the PSP, (b) financial relief in the form of loans and loan guarantees available for operations under the Economic Relief Program (ERP), (c) temporary suspension of certain aviation taxes, (d) temporary deferral of certain employer payroll taxes, and (e) additional Corporate tax benefits.\nThe CARES Act also provided for deferred payment of the employer portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50% of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% due December 31, 2022. Lastly, the CARES Act provided for the carryback of additional NOLs to 2016 and 2017, which will result in tax benefits for those years. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nEconomic Relief Program\nIn September 2020, the Company entered into the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement under the ERP pursuant to which the maximum facility available to be borrowed increased to $622.0 million (the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement). In connection with our entry into the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, we also entered into an ERP Warrant Agreement with the Treasury. On September 25, 2020, we borrowed $45.0 million and issued to the Treasury warrants to purchase up to 380,711 shares of our common stock. We recorded the value of the loan and the warrants on a relative fair value basis as $41.9 million in noncurrent debt and $3.1 million in additional paid in capital, respectively.\nOn February 4, 2021, we repaid in full the $45.0 million loan under the ERP, and in connection with this repayment, terminated the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. The debt extinguishment resulted in the recognition of a loss of $4.0 million, which is reflected in nonoperating income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nPayroll Support Program\nOn April 22, 2020, we entered into a Payroll Support Program agreement (the PSP Agreement) with the Treasury under the CARES Act. In connection with the PSP Agreement, we entered into a Warrant Agreement (the PSP Warrant Agreement) with the Treasury, and we issued a promissory note to the Treasury (the Note). Pursuant to the PSP Agreement, the Treasury provided us with financial assistance, paid in installments, totaling approximately $300.9 million, to be used exclusively for the purpose of continuing to pay employee salaries, wages and benefits. Under the PSP Agreement, we agreed to (i) refrain from conducting involuntary furloughs or reducing employee rates of pay or benefits through September 30, 2020, (ii) limit executive compensation through March 24, 2022 and (iii) suspend payment of dividends and stock repurchases through September 30, 2021. The PSP Agreement also imposes certain Treasury-mandated reporting obligations on us. Finally, we are required to continue to provide air service to markets served prior to March 1, 2020 until March 1, 2022, to the extent determined reasonable and practicable by the DOT and subject to exemptions granted by the DOT to us given the absence of demand for certain of such services.\nThe Note was in the total principal amount of approximately $60.3 million. The Note has a 10-year term and bears interest at a rate per annum equal to 1.00% until the fifth anniversary of April 22, 2020 (the PSP Closing Date), and thereafter bears interest at a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate plus 2.00% until the tenth anniversary of the PSP Closing Date, which interest is payable semi-annually beginning on September 30, 2020. The Note may be prepaid at any time, without penalty, and is subject to customary change of control acceleration provisions and events of default.\nAs compensation to the U.S. government for providing financial relief under the PSP Agreement, and pursuant to the PSP Warrant Agreement, we issued to the Treasury a total of 509,964 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $11.82 per share (the PSP Warrants). The PSP Warrants are non-voting, freely transferable, may be settled as net shares or in cash at our option, expire five years from the date of issuance, and contain registration rights and customary anti-dilution provisions. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nThe CAA 2021 was enacted on December 27, 2020, and provided $15.0 billion for airline employee wages, salaries and benefits under an extension (the PSP Extension) of the Payroll Support Program created under the CARES Act. In January 2021, we entered into a PSP extension agreement with the Treasury (the PSP Extension Agreement). PSP Extension funds are required to be used exclusively for the purpose of continuing to pay employee salaries, wages and benefits, including the payment of lost wages, salaries and benefits to certain returning employees, as defined in the PSP Extension Agreement. Under the PSP Extension Agreement, we agreed to (i) refrain from conducting involuntary furloughs or reducing employee rates of pay or benefits from December 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, (ii) recall any employees who were subject to an involuntary termination or furlough between October 1, 2020 and the date of the PSP Extension Agreement and who elected to return to employment pursuant to a recall notice and to compensate these employees for lost salary, wages and benefits, (iii) limit executive compensation through October 1, 2022, and (iv) suspend payment of dividends and stock repurchases through March 31, 2022. Finally, we are required to continue to provide air service to markets served prior to March 1, 2020 until March 1, 2022, to the extent determined reasonable and practicable by the DOT.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we received $192.7 million in grants, entered into a promissory note with the Treasury (the Extension Note) for approximately $27.8 million and issued to the Treasury warrants to purchase up to a total of 156,341 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $17.78 per share (the PSP Extension Warrants) pursuant to the PSP Extension Agreement. The Extension Note has a 10-year term and bears interest at a rate per annum equal to 1.00% for the first five years and at a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate plus 2.00% for the following five years. We recorded the value of the Extension Note and the PSP Extension Warrants on a relative fair value basis as $23.8 million in noncurrent debt and $4.0 million in additional paid in capital, respectively.\nThe ARP 2021 was enacted on March 11, 2021, and included a second PSP extension, providing an additional $14 billion in grants and loans for airline employee wages, salaries and benefits. In April 2021, we entered into a Payroll Support Program 3 Agreement with the Treasury (PSP3 Agreement), a promissory note (the PSP3 Note), and a Warrant Agreement to purchase up to 87,670 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise of $27.27 (the PSP3 Warrants). The PSP3 Agreement extends (i) the prohibition on conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs through September 2021 or the date on which assistance provided under the agreement is exhausted, whichever is later, (ii) the prohibitions on share repurchases and dividends through September 2022, and (iii) the limitations on executive compensation until April 2023. The terms of the PSP3 Note and PSP3 Warrants are consistent with those of the original PSP and the first PSP Extension. During 2021, we received a total of $179.7 million pursuant to the PSP3 Agreement, consisting of approximately $155.8 million in a grant and $23.9 million in a ten-year loan.\nLoyalty Program and Intellectual Property Financing\nOn February 4, 2021, we completed the private offering (the Notes Offering) by Hawaiian Brand Intellectual Property, Ltd., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Hawaiian (the Brand Issuer), and HawaiianMiles Loyalty, Ltd., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Hawaiian (the Loyalty Issuer and, together with the Brand Issuer, the Issuers) of an aggregate of $1.2 billion principal amount of their 5.750% senior secured notes due 2026 (the Notes). The Notes require interest only payments, payable quarterly in arrears on July 20, October 20, January 20 and April 20 of each year, which began on July 20, 2021.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes, Hawaiian contributed to the Brand Issuer, which is a newly-formed subsidiary structured to be bankruptcy remote, all worldwide rights, owned or purported to be owned, or later developed or acquired and owned or purported to be owned, by Hawaiian or any of its subsidiaries, in and to all intellectual property, including all trademarks, service marks, brand names, designs, and logos that include the word \"Hawaiian\" or any successor brand and the \"hawaiianairlines.com\" domain name and similar domain names or any successor domain names (the Brand IP). The Brand Issuer indirectly granted to Hawaiian an exclusive, worldwide, perpetual and royalty-bearing sublicense to use the Brand IP. Further, Hawaiian contributed to the Loyalty Issuer its rights to certain other collateral owned by Hawaiian, including, to the extent permitted by such agreements or otherwise by operation of law, any of Hawaiian's rights under the HawaiianMiles Agreements and the IP Agreements (each as defined in the Indenture, dated as of February 4, 2021), together with HawaiianMiles program (HawaiianMiles) customer data and certain other intellectual property owned or purported to be owned, or later developed or acquired and owned or purported to be owned, by Hawaiian or any of its subsidiaries (including the Issuers) and required or necessary to operate HawaiianMiles (the Loyalty Program IP) (all such collateral being, the Loyalty Program Collateral). The Loyalty Issuer indirectly granted Hawaiian an exclusive, worldwide, perpetual and royalty-free sub-license to use the Loyalty Program IP.\nThe Notes are redeemable at the option of the Issuers, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, after January 20, 2024 at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture, dated as of February 4, 2021 (the Indenture). In addition, the Notes are redeemable, at the option of the Issuers, at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, prior to January 20, 2024 at a\nprice equal to 100% of their principal amount plus the \"make-whole\" premium described in the Indenture and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. Additionally, from time to time on or prior to January 20, 2024, the Issuers may also redeem up to 40% of the original outstanding principal amount of the Notes with proceeds from any one or more equity offerings of Hawaiian at a redemption price equal to 105.75% of the principal amount of Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. Upon the occurrence of certain mandatory prepayment events and mandatory repurchase offer events, the Issuers will be required to make a prepayment on the Notes, or offer to repurchase the Notes, pro rata, to the extent of any net cash proceeds received in connection with such events, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be prepaid, plus, in some cases, an applicable premium. In addition, upon a change of control of Hawaiian, the Issuers may be required to make an offer to prepay the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the respective principal amounts thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date.\nThe Indenture contains certain covenants that limit the ability of the Issuers, the Cayman Guarantors (as defined below) and, in certain circumstances, Hawaiian to, among other things: (i) make Restricted Payments (as defined in the Indenture), (ii) incur additional indebtedness, (iii) create certain liens on the Loyalty Program Collateral, (iv) sell or otherwise dispose of the Loyalty Program Collateral and (v) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Issuers' assets. The Indenture also requires the Issuers and, in certain circumstances, Hawaiian, to comply with certain affirmative covenants, including depositing the Transaction Revenues (as defined in the Indenture) in collection accounts, with amounts to be distributed for the payment of fees, principal and interest on the Notes pursuant to a payment waterfall described in the Indenture, and certain financial reporting requirements. In addition, the Indenture requires Hawaiian to maintain minimum liquidity at the end of any business day of at least $300.0 million.\nSelected Consolidated Statistical Data\nBelow are the operating statistics we use to measure our operating performance. \n(a)Includes the operations of our contract carrier under a CPA, which was terminated in the first half of 2021.\n(b)Represents adjusted unit costs, a non-GAAP measure. We believe this is a useful measure because it better reflects our controllable costs. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.\n(c)Includes applicable taxes and fees.\nOperating Revenue\nOur revenue is derived primarily from transporting passengers on our aircraft. We record passenger revenue when the transportation is provided or when scheduled flights for tickets are expected to expire unused. We measure capacity in terms of available seat miles, which represent the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown. Yield, or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile, is calculated by dividing passenger revenue by RPMs. Typically, we strive to increase passenger revenue primarily by increasing our yield per flight or by filling a higher proportion of available seats, which produces higher operating revenue per available seat mile. Other revenue primarily consists of cargo revenue, incidental services revenue, marketing component related to the sale of frequent flyer miles, and contract services.\nOperating revenue was $1.60 billion, $0.84 billion and $2.83 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Operating revenue was severely impacted beginning in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the unprecedented spread and ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although restrictions have eased and passenger travel demand has improved, demand and capacity continue to remain below pre-pandemic levels.\n2021 vs. 2020\nPassenger Revenue\nPassenger revenue increased by $706.1 million, or 106.2%, in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year. Details of this change are described in the table below: \nDomestic passenger revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $783.3 million, or 151.4%, as compared to 2020, on capacity growth of 128.0%. Our increased passenger revenue was the result of improved demand for passenger travel, predominantly within our North America routes, driven by the relaxation of travel restrictions for travel to and within the state of Hawai'i. Despite these improvements, demand on our domestic network remains below our pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, down 32.3% during 2021 as compared to 2019.\nDuring 2021, we expanded service with the addition of three new U.S. mainland destinations: Austin, Texas, Orlando, Florida, and Ontario, California with service to and from Honolulu, Hawai'i, each of which commenced between March and April 2021. We also expanded service with a daily non-stop flight between Kahului, Hawai'i and Long Beach, California, which commenced in March 2021. Additionally, in March and April 2021, respectively, we announced the recommencement of our thrice-weekly service between Kahului, Hawai'i and Las Vegas, Nevada, and launched four-times-weekly seasonal service between Kahului, Hawai'i and Phoenix, Arizona, both of which commenced in May 2021.\nInternational passenger revenue decreased $77.2 million, or 52.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020, as a result of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continued restrictions in place for international travel. Although we recommenced scheduled international passenger flights on a limited basis beginning in late 2020, customer demand across our international network remains depressed given government travel restrictions, particularly as new variants of the COVID-19 virus have emerged and spread. We expect to see depressed international demand through at least the first quarter of 2022 because of the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, with improvement in our international markets expected to lag behind domestic demand recovery until government travel restrictions begin to lift and customer demand starts to return.\nOther Operating Revenue\nOther operating revenue increased by $45.7 million, or 25.4%, in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to reductions in cargo and loyalty program revenue that occurred in the second half of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCargo revenue increased $19.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year due to increased volume and yield as a result of the unfavorable impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on 2020 results; however cargo revenue was down $1.1 million compared to 2019. Loyalty revenue, primarily comprised of brand and marketing performance obligations, increased $17.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior\nyear, as a result of increased credit card spend and new cardholder acquisitions, but down $3.0 million as compared to 2019. Other components in Other operating revenue include, but are not limited to, ground handling and other freight services which collectively, increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 by approximately $8.5 million as compared to the prior year, primarily attributed to increased volumes and contract service operations.\nOperating Expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, total operating expense increased $0.2 billion or 12.5% to $1.7 billion as compared to 2020. Increases (decreases) in operating expenses are detailed below. \nAircraft fuel\nThe price and availability of aircraft fuel is volatile due to global economic and geopolitical factors that we can neither control nor accurately predict. The increase in aircraft fuel expense is illustrated in the following table: \nWe believe economic fuel expense is the best measure of the effect of fuel prices on our business as it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with the purchase of fuel for our operations and is consistent with how management manages our business and assesses our operating performance. We define economic fuel expense as GAAP fuel expense plus (gains)/losses realized through actual cash (receipts)/payments received from or paid to hedge counterparties for fuel hedge derivative contracts settled in the period inclusive of costs related to hedging premiums.\nEconomic fuel expense is calculated as follows: \nSee Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, for additional discussion of our jet fuel costs and related derivative program.\nWages and benefits\nWages and benefits expense increased by $69.5 million, or 11.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior period. Actions taken by the Company in 2020, in response to decreased passenger travel demand attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, had a significant impact on wages and benefits during the prior period. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, improving domestic travel demand led to the ramp up of domestic operations, notably amongst our front-line employees. These actions, combined with scheduled contractual wage increases, resulted in higher wages and benefits during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020. We expect that wages and benefits will increase during the first quarter of 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, as a result of the ramp up of our domestic operations and contractual wage increases.\nMaintenance materials and repairs\nMaintenance materials and repairs increased $48.5 million, or 39.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily attributed to increased utilization of our aircraft commensurate with the ramp up of our operations during the period, as discussed above. We expect maintenance, materials and repairs expense to increase in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, as we continue to rebuild operational capacity combined with scheduled heavy maintenance events and inflationary pressures.\nAircraft and passenger servicing\nAircraft and passenger servicing expense increased by $47.7 million, or 82.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily due to increased capacity and passengers flown, as discussed above. We expect aircraft and passenger servicing expense to increase in the first quarter of 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, as we continue to rebuild operational capacity.\nCommissions and other selling expenses\nCommissions and other selling expenses increased by $26.2 million, or 56.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year. The increase in commissions and other selling expense was primarily related to the increase in operational capacity and passenger travel, as discussed above. We expect commissions and other selling expense to increase in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 as we continue to rebuild our operational capacity.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $13.4 million, or 8.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year. The decrease is attributed to (a) the reclassification of approximately $29.5 million of ATR and commercial real estate assets to assets held for sale and (b) a reduction in capital expenditures during 2021 and 2020 below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels while other existing fixed assets have fully depreciated.\nOther rentals and landing fees\nOther rentals and landing fees increased by $43.0 million, or 58.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year. A portion of our other rentals and landing fees are variable in nature and are dependent on factors such as the number of departures and passengers. The increase in landing fees and other rents is attributed to increased operations as discussed above. We expect other rentals and landing fees expense to increase in the first quarter of 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, as we rebuild operational capacity and passenger travel demand continues to improve, and due to inflationary pressures and increased infrastructure projects at various airports in which we operate, the costs of which are passed onto airlines.\nSpecial items\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we announced the termination of our 'Ohana by Hawaiian operations, which operated under a capacity purchase agreement (CPA) with a third-party carrier. We reclassified approximately $23.6 million to assets held for sale and recognized a one-time expense of $6.4 million to write-down the asset group to fair value. Additionally, we recorded a charge of approximately $2.6 million for the early termination of the CPA.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 we recognized approximately $184.1 million of special items expense, comprised of the following:\n\u2022In March 2020, we reached an agreement in principle with our flight attendants, represented by the AFA, on a new five-year contract that runs through April 2025. On April 3, 2020, we received notification from the AFA that a collective bargaining agreement (the CBA) was ratified by its members. The ratified CBA provides for, among other things, a ratification payment to be paid over a one-year term, increased medical cost sharing, improved pay scales, and a one-time medical savings contribution to eligible flight attendants upon retirement. During the first quarter of 2020, we recorded a $23.5 million ratification bonus, of which $20.2 million was related to service prior to January 1, 2020, and recognized this as a special item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The remaining $3.3 million was recorded as a component of wages and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\u2022During the first quarter of 2020, the adverse economic impact and declining passenger demand attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic drove our stock price to 52-week lows and significantly reduced future cash flow projections. We qualitatively assessed that an impairment loss may have been incurred as of March 31, 2020 and performed an interim test of the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We determined that the estimated fair value of our one reporting unit was less than its carrying value and that the deficit between fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded the amount of goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, leading to the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge of $106.7 million in the first quarter of 2020.\n\u2022During the second quarter of 2020, we recorded special items of $34.0 million comprised of: (a) an impairment charge of $27.5 million to mark down our ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleets to fair value; (b) an impairment charge of $3.4 million to mark down our commercial real estate assets to fair value; and (c) an approximately $3.1 million write-off for discontinued software-related projects as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022During the third quarter of 2020, we announced and completed voluntary separation programs across each of our labor groups providing for one-time severance payments, the establishment of health reimbursement accounts and other benefits. Additionally, we announced involuntary separation and temporary leave programs, the majority of which were effective October 1, 2020. We recorded $17.8 million in severance and benefits as an operating special item and $5.7 million related to special termination benefits and curtailment loss as a nonoperating special item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\u2022During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded long-lived asset impairment of approximately $5.4 million, comprised of an additional write-down of our ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleet of approximately $4.9 million as a result of ongoing market uncertainty attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also wrote off of approximately $0.5 million in capitalized software projects that were permanently suspended in response to the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we recorded $0.3 million in additional costs for the finalization of the separation programs discussed above.\nGovernment grant recognition\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we received $372.4 million and $300.9 million in federal payroll support payments, of which $320.6 million and $240.6 million, respectively, was in the form of a grant. These funds were required to be used exclusively for the payment of employee wages, salaries and benefits. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized approximately $320.6 million and $240.6 million, respectively, as contra-expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2021, we utilized all funds received under the federal payroll support programs to pay salaries and wages and reinstate employees previously impacted by involuntary leaves and terminations.\nOther expense\nOther expense increased by $9.0 million, or 8.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributed to our ramp up of operations and increase in technology projects, including personnel-related expenditures for crew travel, professional and technical services, and other miscellaneous expenditures. We expect other expense to increase during the first quarter of 2022 as we continue to rebuild operational capacity.\nNonoperating expense, net\nNet nonoperating expense increased by $50.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year. The increase in expense was primarily attributed to an increase in interest expense as a result of the $1.2 billion loyalty and intellectual property financing completed in February 2021 combined with the recognition of approximately $38.9 million in losses related to the extinguishment of long-term debt. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. These losses were offset by approximately $27.6 million in unrealized gains associated with our Japanese Yen-denominated debt as a result of favorable exchange rates.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective tax rate was 21.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with 27.0% for the prior year. The effective tax rate represents a blend of federal and state taxes and includes the impact of the $4.4 million valuation allowance reserve recorded against state deferred tax assets. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, we took various actions to increase liquidity and strengthen our financial position. For discussion on the actions we took in 2020, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 12, 2021. Refer to Cash Flow and Uses of Liquidity section for discussion of 2021 financing activities.\nCash, cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash) and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared to $0.9 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by approximately $902.9 million as compared to $113.93 million as of December 31, 2020. Approximately $631.2 million of our current liabilities relate to our advanced ticket sales and frequent flyer deferred revenue.\nWe cannot assure you that the assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements will be correct because we have never experienced such an unprecedented event impacting global travel and, as a consequence, our ability to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain. In addition, the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain. However, we expect to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months with cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash), short-term investments and cash flows from operations. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and financing arrangements.\nCash Flow and Uses of Liquidity\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $251.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $310.7 million in the prior year. Our operating cash flows are impacted by the following factors:\nAdvanced Ticket Sales. We sell tickets for air travel and record the receipt on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability. The air traffic liability typically increases during the winter and spring months as advanced ticket sales grow prior to the summer and fall peak travel seasons and decreases upon utilization during these seasons. The ongoing impact of COVID-19 has resulted in a lower level of advanced bookings than historically experienced, which has impacted seasonal trends. As discussed above, we noted marked improvements in air travel demand in 2021, as compared to 2020; however, demand (measured in passengers flown) and revenue remain well below 2019 levels. The ongoing impact and severity of the reduction in travel demand due to COVID-19 and related variants are uncertain, as described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nFuel. Fuel expense represented approximately 21.6% of our total operating expense in 2021. The market price for jet fuel is volatile, which can impact the comparability of our cash flows from operations. We expect fuel consumption to increase in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 as we continue to ramp up operational capacity.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Funding. We sponsor a defined pension plan covering eligible pilots and retirees. This plan is closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals. Additionally, we sponsor four unfunded defined benefit postretirement medical and life insurance plans and a separate plan to administer the pilots' disability benefits. As of December 31, 2021, the excess of the projected benefit obligations over the fair value of plan assets was approximately $168.4 million. We contributed $4.1 million to our disability plan in both 2021 and 2020.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we were not required to, and did not make, contributions to our defined benefit pension plan. Future funding requirements for our defined benefit and other postretirement plans are dependent upon many factors such as interest rates, funded status, applicable regulatory requirements and the level and timing of asset returns. Given available funding credits in the defined benefit plan and funding status, we do not anticipate requiring any cash contributions to our defined benefit plan between 2022 through 2024. For our pilot's disability plan, we anticipate annual contributions to the plan of approximately $4.0 million between 2022 and 2026.\nGovernment Support Programs. Operating cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 included $320.6 million and $240.6 million in proceeds received as part of the government payroll support programs, all of which was utilized in each respective year to offset eligible payroll and payroll-related costs. As of December 31, 2021, all funds were utilized towards their stated purpose.\nOperating Lease Obligations. As described further in Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2021 we had a total of $502.5 million of minimum operating lease obligations. These minimum lease payments range from approximately $59.9 million to $104.5 million on an annual basis over the next five years.\nOther Commitments. We have certain purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services, including, but not limited to aircraft maintenance, IT, capacity purchases, and reservations. Total contractual obligations do not include long-term contracts where the commitment is variable in nature (with no minimum guarantee), such as aircraft maintenance deposits due under operating leases and fees due under certain other agreements such as aircraft maintenance power-by-the-hour, computer reservation systems and credit card processing agreements, or when the agreements contain short-term cancellation provisions. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $4.8 billion of such obligations, which range from approximately $439.8 million to $1.7 billion on an annual basis over the next five years.\nInvesting Activities\nShort-Term Investments. During 2021, we acquired approximately $897.8 million (net of sales) in short-term investments, a portion of which was funded from proceeds we obtained through our financing transactions. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these investments.\nCapital Expenditures. Our capital expenditures are primarily related to the purchase of aircraft, fleet modifications and technology enhancements. Our capital expenditures decreased to $39.3 million in 2021 as compared to $105.3 million in 2020, primarily as a result of the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and our focus on strengthening our financial position.\nWe expect that we will have capital expenditures between approximately $105 million and $125 million in 2022, primarily for aircraft, including advance deposit payments for future aircraft deliveries and aircraft modifications, along with facility upgrades and technology enhancements. We expect that the capital expenditures in 2022 will be funded through available liquidity and cash flows from operations. We have committed to future aircraft purchases, with scheduled deliveries between 2023 and 2026.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had the following capital commitments consisting of firm aircraft and engine orders and purchase rights:\n\nCommitted expenditures for these aircraft, engines, and related flight equipment are approximately $92 million in 2022, $418 million in 2023, $503 million in 2024, $411 million in 2025, and $234 million in 2026.\nIn October 2020, we entered into an amendment to our Boeing 787-9 purchase agreement, which changed the scheduled delivery of each aircraft and related engines to between 2022 and 2026. In December 2021, we received notification of further delivery delays, and we have agreed to defer delivery of our first two aircraft from the scheduled delivery date at the end of 2022, to the first half of 2023. The remainder of the B787-9 delivery schedule has not changed. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nIn order to complete the purchase of these aircraft and fund related costs, we may need to secure acceptable financing. We have backstop financing available from aircraft and engine manufacturers, subject to certain customary conditions. Financing may be necessary to satisfy our capital commitments for firm order aircraft and other related capital expenditures. We can provide no\nassurance that any financing not already in place for aircraft and spare engine deliveries will be available to us on acceptable terms when necessary or at all.\nFinancing Activities\nDebt and finance lease obligations. As discussed above, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that began in early 2020, we took actions to shore up our liquidity and financial position. In February 2021, we also completed the issuance of $1.2 billion in 5.75% senior secured notes, which are collateralized by our loyalty program and intellectual property. The Notes require quarterly interest payments and mature in January 2026. See above and Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the offering.\nAs our liquidity stabilized following the offering, we repaid approximately $440.9 million in future debt obligations during the year ended December 31, 2021 as follows:\n\u2022In February 2021, we (a) paid in full the $45.0 million ERP loan issued pursuant to the CARES Act, and in connection with such repayment, terminated the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. The warrants remain outstanding pursuant to the terms of the agreement, and (b) repaid the $235.0 million outstanding balance drawn on our revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility matures in December 2022 and remains available to draw upon at a future date in the event the need arises.\n\u2022In October 2021, we repurchased approximately $160.9 million of our outstanding 7.375% Series 2020-1A Pass Through Certificates due 2027 and 11.250% Series 2020-1B Pass Through Certificates due 2025, and incurred a $34.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which is recorded in loss on extinguishment of debt in non-operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIn addition, we received approximately $372.4 million through government payroll support programs discussed above, of which approximately $51.7 million was issued as a Note due at maturity in 2031.\nAs of December 31, 2021 our total debt was $1.8 billion, compared to $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nFuture Debt Obligations. As described in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2021, scheduled maturities of our debt in 2022 and 2023 were $98.7 million and $63.7 million, with scheduled maturities from 2024 through 2026 of $61.6 million, $79.1 million, and $1,347.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, scheduled maturities after 2026 aggregate to $188.3 million. In addition, we are obligated to make periodic interest payments at fixed and variable rates, depending on the terms of the applicable debt agreements. Based on applicable interest rates and scheduled debt maturities as of December 31, 2021, these interest obligations total $87.0 million in 2022, $84.0 million in 2023, $82.2 million in 2024, $80.1 million in 2025, $24.3 million in 2026, and $11.7 million thereafter.\nFinance Lease Obligations. As described further in Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2021, we had a total of $125.1 million of minimum finance lease obligations. These minimum lease payments range from approximately $11.3 million to $29.5 million on an annual basis over the next five years.\nIssuance of Equity. In December 2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the Equity Distribution Agreement) with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, BNP Paribas Securities Corp. and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (the Managers) relating to the issuance and sale of up to 5.0 million shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we sold 2.9 million shares pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement at an average price of $24.47 per share, with net proceeds totaling approximately $68.1 million. As of March 5, 2021, we sold all of the 5.0 million shares authorized under the Equity Distribution Agreement, at an average price of $22.46 per share, with net proceeds of approximately $109.3 million.\nReturn to Shareholders. In November 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock over a two-year period through December 2020. On March 18, 2020, we indefinitely suspended all repurchases under the approved repurchase plan in connection with our receipt of financial assistance under federal Payroll Support Programs, which restricts us from repurchasing shares and making dividend payments until September 30, 2022. We spent $7.5 million to repurchase and retire approximately 0.3 million shares of our common stock in open market transactions during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following table displays information with respect to our stock repurchase programs as of December 31, 2021:\n\nWe declared and paid cash dividends of $0.0 million, $5.5 million, and $22.8 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our receipt of financial assistance under federal Payroll Support Programs precludes us from making any further dividend payments until September 30, 2022.\nUndrawn Lines of Credit. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $235.0 million undrawn and available under our revolving credit facility that matures in December 2022. We are currently exploring options to renew our revolving credit facility.\nCredit Card Holdbacks. Under our bank-issued credit card processing agreements, proceeds from advance ticket sales may be held back to serve as collateral to cover any possible chargebacks or other disputed charges that may occur. These holdbacks, are reported as restricted cash in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no holdbacks held with our credit card processors. In the event of a material adverse change in our business, the holdback could increase to an amount up to 100% of the applicable credit card activity for all unflown tickets, which would also result in an increase in the required level of restricted cash. If we are unable to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate the increase in the restriction of cash, it could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nCovenants. We are in compliance with covenants in our debt and lease agreements at December 31, 2021.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe believe the disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures is useful information to readers of our financial statements because:\n\u2022We believe it is the basis by which we are evaluated by industry analysts and investors;\n\u2022These measures are often used in management and Board of Directors' decision making analysis;\n\u2022It improves a reader's ability to compare our results to those of other airlines; and\n\u2022It is consistent with how we present information in our quarterly earnings press releases.\nSee table below for reconciliation between GAAP consolidated net income to adjusted consolidated net income, including per share amounts (in thousands unless otherwise indicated). The adjustments are described below:\n\u2022During the year ended December 31, 2020, the effective tax rate included a tax benefit of $45.4 million resulting from the rate differential between the prevailing tax rate of 21% during the years that generated the NOLs and the previous tax rate of 35% that was in effect during the years to which NOLs were carried back as a result of the enactment of the CARES Act. This benefit is attributed to the enactment of the CARES Act and we believe that exclusion of this tax benefit provides investors comparability of results between periods.\n\u2022During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized $320.6 million in contra-expense related to grant proceeds from the federal payroll support programs as compared to $240.6 million recognized in the prior year. The grant proceeds were recognized in proportion to estimated wages and benefits expense over the period the grant covers. We utilized all proceeds under the federal payroll support programs as of December 31, 2021.\n\u2022Losses on the extinguishment of debt are excluded to allow investors to better analyze our core operational performance and more readily compare our results to other results in the periods presented below.\n\u2022Changes in fair value of derivative contracts, net of tax, are based on market prices for open contracts as of the end of the reporting period. This adjustment includes the unrealized gains and losses on fuel and interest rate derivatives (not designated as hedges) that will settle in future periods and the reversal of prior period unrealized amounts. Excluding the impact of these derivative adjustments allows investors to analyze our core operational performance and compare our results to other airlines in the periods presented below.\n\u2022Changes in fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts, net of tax, are based on market prices for open contracts as of the end of the reporting period. This adjustment includes the unrealized amounts of foreign currency derivatives (not designated as hedges) that will settle in future periods and the reversal of prior period unrealized amounts. We believe that excluding the impact of these derivative adjustments helps investors analyze our operational performance and compare our results to other airlines in the periods presented below.\n\u2022Change in unrealized losses (gains) on foreign debt are based on fluctuations in foreign exchanges rates related to foreign-denominated debt agreements. We believe that excluding the impact of these amounts helps investors analyze our operational performance and compare our results to other airlines in the periods presented below.\nSpecial Items\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 we recognized approximately $184.1 million of special items expense, comprised of the following:\n\u2022During the first quarter of 2020, we recognized $126.9 million of special items in the Consolidated Statements of Operation, comprised of the following:\n\u25e6On April 3, 2020, we received notification from the AFA that the CBA was ratified by its members. The ratified CBA provided for, among other things, a ratification payment, payable over twelve months. We recorded a $23.5 million ratification bonus, of which $20.2 million related to service prior to January 1, 2020, and was recorded as a special item.\n\u25e6We recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $106.7 million. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n\u2022During the second quarter of 2020, we recognized a charge of $34.0 million associated with the impairment of certain of our long-lived assets. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n\u2022During the third quarter of 2020, we announced and completed voluntary separation programs across each of our labor groups providing for one-time severance payments, the establishment of health reimbursement accounts and other benefits. Additionally, we announced involuntary separation programs, the majority of which were effective October 1, 2020. We recorded $17.5 million in severance and benefits as an operating special item and $5.7 million related to special termination benefits and curtailment loss as a nonoperating special item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\u2022During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded long-lived asset impairment of approximately $5.4 million, comprised of an additional write-down of our ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleet of approximately $4.9 million as a result of ongoing market uncertainty attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also wrote off approximately $0.5 million in capitalized software projects that were permanently suspended in response to the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we recorded $0.3 million in additional costs for the finalization of the voluntary and involuntary separation programs discussed above.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we recognized approximately $9.0 million of special items expense, comprised of the following:\n\u2022During the second quarter of 2021, we announced the termination of our 'Ohana by Hawaiian operations, which operated under a CPA with a third-party carrier. The asset group met the requirements for, and was reclassified as Held-for-Sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We fair valued the asset group resulting in the write-down of approximately $6.4 million. Additionally, we recorded an early termination charge associated with the CPA of approximately $2.6 million.\nWe believe that excluding such special items helps investors analyze our operational performance and compare our results to other airlines in the periods presented below.\n\nOperating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM)\nWe have separately listed in the table below our fuel costs per ASM and non-GAAP unit costs, excluding fuel and special items. These amounts are included in CASM, but for internal purposes we consistently use cost metrics that exclude fuel and special items (if applicable) to measure and monitor its costs. CASM and CASM excluding fuel and non-recurring items are summarized in the table below: \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those accounting policies and accounting estimates that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and that potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below. See the summary of significant accounting policies included in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the application of these estimates and other accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nPassenger revenue. We record direct passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on Hawaiian as passenger revenue when the transportation is provided or when scheduled flights for tickets are expected to expire unused.\nThe value of unused passenger tickets is included in current liabilities as Air traffic liability. Prior to the second quarter of 2020, non-refundable tickets sold and credits issued generally expired 13 months from the date of issuance or flight, as applicable. In April 2020, we announced the waiver of certain change fees and extended ticket validity for up to 24 months for (a) tickets issued between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 and (b) tickets issued prior to March 1, 2020 for original travel between March 1, 2020 and February 28, 2021. In December 2021, we announced the further extension of ticket validity to December 31, 2022, which also includes all Main Cabin and First Class passenger tickets purchased in 2021. We record an estimate of breakage revenue on the scheduled flight date for tickets that will expire unused. These estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results, available market information, forecasted trends and the extension of the expiration date for certain tickets impacted by COVID-19. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized approximately $48.3 million in advanced ticket breakage. The primary assumption utilized in our calculation of advanced ticket breakage involves an estimate of future breakage patterns, which is based on a combination of historical activity and expected customer behavior. A 10% change in this rate represents a change of approximately $4.8 million in advanced ticket breakage. Given the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on actual results and its continued impact on travel demand, we continue to monitor customers' travel behavior and may adjust our estimates in the future.\nTicket change fees are recorded in Air traffic liability and recognized when the related transportation is provided. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized approximately $4.8 million and $11.3 million, respectively in ticket change fee revenue.\nFrequent flyer revenue. HawaiianMiles, Hawaiian's frequent flyer travel award program, provides a variety of awards to program members based on accumulated mileage. ASC 606 requires us to account for miles earned by passengers in the HawaiianMiles program through flight activity as a component of the passenger revenue ticket transaction at the estimated selling price of the miles. Ticket consideration received is allocated between the performance obligations, primarily travel and miles earned by passengers. The allocated value of the miles is deferred until the free travel or other award is used by the passenger, at which time it is included in passenger revenue. The value of the ticket used in the determination of the estimated selling price is based on the historical value of equivalent flights to those provided for loyalty awards and the related miles redeemed to obtain that award adjusted for breakage or fulfillment. The equivalent ticket value (ETV) includes a fulfillment discount (breakage) to reflect the value of the award ticket over the number of miles that, based on historical experience, will be needed to obtain the award. On a quarterly basis, we calculate the ETV by analyzing the fares of similar tickets for the prior 12 months, considering cabin class and geographic region.\nWe also sell mileage credits to companies participating in our frequent flyer program. These contracts generally include multiple performance obligations, including the transportation that will ultimately be provided when the mileage credits are redeemed and marketing and brand related activities.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we amended our partnership with Barclaycard US, Hawaiian's co-branded credit card partner. Management determined that the amendment should be accounted for as a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract under ASC 606 and the relative selling price was determined for each performance obligation of the new agreement. The new agreement continues through 2024 and includes improved economics and enhanced product offerings for our Barclay's co-branded cardholders. The amended agreement did not change, and includes the following performance obligations; (i) transportation that will ultimately be provided when mileage credits are redeemed (transportation), (ii) the Hawaiian Airlines brand and access to its members lists (collectively, brand performance), (iii) marketing, and (iv) airline benefits to cardholders, including discounts and anniversary travel benefits, baggage waivers and inflight purchase credits. We determined the relative fair value of each performance obligation by estimating the selling prices of the deliverables by\nconsidering discounted cash flows using multiple inputs and assumptions, including: (1) the expected number of miles to be awarded and redeemed; (2) the estimated weighted average equivalent ticket value, adjusted by a fulfillment discount; (3) the estimated total annual cardholder spend; (4) an estimated royalty rate for the Hawaiian portfolio; and (5) the expected use of each of the airline benefits. The overall consideration received is allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative selling prices.\nThe transportation performance obligation is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when the transportation is provided. The value to the financial institution is provided each time a new cardholder chooses the Hawaiian branded credit card and each time a cardholder chooses to use the co-branded credit card. Therefore, we recognize revenue for the brand performance obligation as members use their co-brand credit card and the resulting mileage credits are issued to them, which best correlates with our performance toward satisfying the obligation.\nAccounting for frequent flyer revenue involves the use of various techniques to estimate revenue. To determine the total estimated transaction price, we forecast future credit card activity based on historical data. The relative selling price is determined using management's estimated standalone selling price of each performance obligation. The objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis. Accordingly, we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including, but not limited to, discounted cash flows, brand value, number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed. We estimate the selling price of miles using an ETV adjusted for a fulfillment discount as described above.\nIn April 2021, we announced the elimination of our HawaiianMiles expiration policy, effective April 1, 2021. Prior to this change in policy, miles expired after 18 months of member account inactivity. We review our breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns (e.g., credit card and non-credit card holders). Our estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment. Current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy, or to program rules and program could affect the estimated value of a mile. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including changes to our ticket validity and exchange policies, management continues to monitor customers' travel behavior and may adjust its estimates in the future as additional information becomes available. We do not believe that the change in expiration policy will have a material impact on our accounting estimates and will continue to evaluate the impact of this change as additional information becomes available.\nPension and Other Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits\nThe calculation of pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit expenses and its corresponding liabilities require the use of significant assumptions, including the assumed discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, expected mortality rates of the plan participants, and the expected health care cost trend rate. Changes in these assumptions will impact the expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience may differ from these assumptions.\nThe significant assumptions as of December 31, 2021 are as follows:\n\nN/A Not Applicable\n^ Expected return on plan assets used to determine the net periodic benefit expense for 2022 is 6.06% for the pension plans and 4.35% for the disability plan.\nThe expected long-term rate of return assumption is developed by evaluating input from the trustee managing the plans' assets, including the trustee's review of asset class return expectations by several consultants and economists, as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets, which is based on our goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels. The Retirement Plan for Pilots of Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. and the Pilot's Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association Disability and Survivor's Benefit Plan strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from any one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. We believe that our long-term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation. We periodically review our actual asset allocation and rebalance the pension plan's investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return by 100 basis points will have the following effects on our estimated 2022 pension and disability benefit expense recorded in wages and benefits and nonoperating expense: \nWe determine the appropriate discount rate for each of our plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due. The pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and future expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate by 100 basis points would have the following effects:\n\nThe health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience taking into account current and expected market conditions. Changes in the assumed current health care cost trend rate by year by 100 basis points would have the following annual effects:\n\n\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets used in operations, consisting principally of aircraft and other non-aircraft equipment, are classified as property and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and have a carrying value of approximately $2.0 billion at December 31, 2021. We review long-lived assets used in operations for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying value. To determine whether impairment exists for aircraft used in operations, assets are grouped at the fleet-type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and future cash flows are estimated based on projections of capacity, passenger mile yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors. If, at any time, management determines the net carrying value of an asset is not recoverable, the amount is reduced to its fair value during the period in which such determination is made. Any changes in the estimated useful lives of these assets will be accounted for prospectively.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 we identified indicators of impairment of our long-lived assets. During the second quarter of 2020, it was determined that the net carrying values of our ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleets and assets held under our commercial real estate subsidiary were not recoverable through the generation of future undiscounted cash flows as of June 30, 2020. We estimated the fair value of our ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleets using a third-party valuation, which takes into consideration market pricing information, among other factors, and resulted in a $27.5 million impairment charge. We estimated the fair value of our commercial real-estate entity using a combination of a market and income-based approach, which estimates fair value based upon projections of future revenues, expenses, and cash flows discounted to its present value, which resulted in a $3.4 million impairment charge. The principal assumptions used in our discounted cash flow analysis consisted of (a) the long-term projections of future financial performance and (b) the weighted-average cost of capital of market participants, adjusted for the risk attributable to us and the industry in which we operate.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded long-lived asset impairment of approximately $5.4 million, comprised of an additional write-down of our ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleet of $4.9 million as a result of ongoing market uncertainty attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also wrote off of approximately $0.5 million in capitalized software projects that were permanently suspended in response to the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we announced the termination of our 'Ohana by Hawaiian operations, which utilizes the ATR-42 and ATR-72 fleet, and was operated under a capacity purchase agreement (CPA) with a third-party carrier. Following the termination of the operations, which were temporarily suspended in late 2020, management committed to a plan of sale and wrote-down the related assets by approximately $6.4 million to fair value, less cost to sell, and classified approximately $23.4 million as assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2021, management committed to a plan to sell certain commercial real-estate assets held by one of the Company's subsidiaries. Management fair valued the assets, less the cost to sell, which did not result in a write-down to the asset group, and as of December 31, 2021, reclassified approximately $6.1 million as assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management expects to complete the sale of the above referenced assets within 12 months from the original designation date, and will continue to monitor the asset groups for potential impairment.\nIn addition, we will continue to monitor the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and will continue to evaluate our current fleet and other long-lived assets for impairment accordingly.\nIncome Tax Valuation Allowance\nWe periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets and establish valuation allowances if it is not likely we will realize our deferred income tax assets. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, our deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical financial results, our industry's historically cyclical financial results and potential current and future tax planning strategies. We cannot presently determine when we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to realize all of our state deferred tax assets. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a valuation allowance of $14.1 million and $9.6 million, respectively, against our deferred tax assets. If we determine that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the remainder of our deferred income tax assets, we will reverse our valuation allowance (in full or in part), resulting in an income tax benefit in the period such a determination is made.", "item_7_tables": "Table 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

severely impacted air travel demand starting in early 2020. Travel restrictions reduced passenger revenue by 47% in 2021 compared to 2019. International travel was hit especially hard, with revenue down 90% in 2021 vs 2019. \n\n- In response, Hawaiian Airlines took steps to shore up liquidity, including receiving government payroll support, raising $1.2 billion through an intellectual property financing, and drawing on credit facilities. \n\n- As travel demand recovered in 2021, revenue increased to $1.6 billion from $0.84 billion in 2020. Capacity ramped back up to 91% of 2019 levels. However, the Omicron variant slowed international recovery.\n\n- Operating expenses increased 12.5% in 2021 to $1.7 billion. Key drivers were increased fuel costs, wages as operations ramped back up, and variable costs like maintenance and commissions. \n\n- Non-operating expense increased due to higher interest costs from debt raised during the pandemic. \n\n- The company expects domestic travel demand to reach 2019 levels in 2022. Continued uncertainty around international travel demand remains a risk.\n\n- Hawaiian took impairment charges in 2020 on aircraft and real estate assets but saw no further impairment in 2021.\n\n- The company has committed capital expenditures for new aircraft deliveries over 2023-2026. It will continue to monitor demand and fleet needs.\n\nIn summary, the pandemic severely impacted financial results in 2020-2021 but the company shored up liquidity and saw demand recovery, especially domestically, in 2021. Uncertainty remains around the pace of international recovery."}
