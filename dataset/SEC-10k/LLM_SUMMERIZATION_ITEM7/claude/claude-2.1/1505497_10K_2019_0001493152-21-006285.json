The FDA review and approval process can be lengthy, expensive and uncertain and there is no guarantee of ultimate approval or clearance.\nLaboratory\nWe have established a laboratory in Melville, New York for research purposes and have built a cleanroom within the laboratory for the possible production of cell-based product candidates, such as BRTX-100, for use in a clinical trial, for third party cell products or general research purposes.\nAs operations grow, our plans include the expansion of our laboratory to perform cellular characterization and culturing, protocol and stem cell-related IP development, translational research and therapeutic outcome analysis. As we develop our business and our stem cell product candidates and obtain regulatory approval, we will seek to establish ourselves as a key provider of adult stem cells for therapies and expand to provide cells in other market areas for stem cell therapy. We may also use outside laboratories specializing in cell therapy services and manufacturing of cell products.\nTable 43: <table><tr><td>15 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTechnology; Research and Development\nWe intend to utilize our laboratory or a third party laboratory in connection with cellular research activities. We also intend to obtain cellular-based therapeutic technology licenses and increase our IP portfolio. We intend to seek to develop potential stem cell delivery systems or devices. The goal of these specialized delivery systems or devices is to deliver cells into specific areas of the body, control the rate, amount and types of cells used in a treatment, and populate these areas of the body with sufficient stem cells so that there is a successful therapeutic result.\nWe also intend to perform research to develop certain stem cell optimization compounds, media designed to enhance cellular growth and regeneration for the purpose of improving pre-treatment and post-treatment outcomes.\nIn our Disc/Spine Program, two patent applications have been filed with regard to technology that is the subject of the Regenerative License Agreement (see Disc/Spine Program-License\u201d above). Regenerative has been issued a patent from one of these applications with regard to its curved needle therapeutic delivery device. The other application remains pending. The patents that are the subject of the Regenerative License Agreement have been assigned to Regenexx, LLC which we have been advised is an affiliate of Regenerative.\nIn our ThermoStem Program, we have three pending United States patent applications and four United States patents within three patent families. With regards to the first patent family in the ThermoStem Program, patent applications have been filed in five foreign jurisdictions (of which four applications have been granted as foreign patents and one application, which is not listed in the table below, has lapsed). With regards to the second patent family in the ThermoStem Program, patent applications have been filed in four foreign jurisdictions (of which three applications have been granted as foreign patents). With regards to the third patent family in the ThermoStem Program, a U.S. application and PCT application have been filed.\nOur patent applications and those of Regenexx, LLC are currently in prosecution (i.e., we and Regenexx, LLC are seeking issued patents).

We intend to rely on a combination of patent, trade secret and know-how, copyright and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, licensing agreements, non-compete agreements and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Our success will also depend upon our ability to avoid infringing upon the proprietary rights of others, for if we are judicially determined to have infringed such rights, we may be required to pay damages, alter our services, products or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred $1,722,338 and $1,513,150, respectively, in research and development expenses.\nScientific Advisors\nWe have established a Scientific Advisory Board whose purpose is to provide advice and guidance in connection with scientific matters relating to our business. The Scientific Advisory Board has established a Disc Advisory Committee which focuses on matters relating to our Disc/Spine Program. Our Scientific Advisory Board members are Dr. Wayne Marasco (Chairman), Dr. Naiyer Imam, Dr. Wayne Olan, Dr. Joy Cavagnaro, Dr. Jason Lipetz, Dr. Harvinder Sandhu, Dr. Christopher Plastaras and Dr. Gerard A. Malanga. The Disc Advisory Committee members are Dr. Lipetz (Chairman), Dr. Olan, Dr. Sandhu, Dr. Plastaras and Dr. Malanga. See Item 10 ( Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance-Scientific Advisors\u201d) for a listing of the principal positions for Drs. Marasco, Imam, Olan, Cavagnaro, Lipetz, Sandhu, Plastaras and Malanga.\nTable 49: <table><tr><td>17 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCompetition\nWe will compete with many pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies, as well as other private and public stem cell companies involved in the development and commercialization of cell-based medical technologies and therapies.\nRegenerative medicine is rapidly progressing, in large part through the development of cell-based therapies or devices designed to isolate cells from human tissues. Most efforts involve cell sources, such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, embryonic and fetal tissue, umbilical cord and peripheral blood and skeletal muscle.\nCompanies working in the area of regenerative medicine with regard to the disc and spine include, among others, Mesoblast, SpinalCyte, DiscGenics and Isto Biologics. Companies that are developing products and therapies to combat obesity and diabetes, including through the use of brown fat, include, among others, Novo Nordisk, Sanofi, Merck, Eli Lilly, Roche, Pfizer and Regeneron.\nMany of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing and personnel resources than we do. We cannot, with any accuracy, forecast when or if these companies are likely to bring their products and therapies to market in competition with those that we are pursuing.\nWith the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA\u201d), an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products was created. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and the proposed biosimilar product. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product, and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years following approval of the reference product, and it may not be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product is approved under a biologics license application ( BLA\u201d).\nWe believe that, if any of our product candidates are approved as a biological product under a BLA, it should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that the FDA could permit biosimilar applicants to reference approved biologics other than our therapeutic candidates, thus circumventing our exclusivity and potentially creating the opportunity for competition sooner than anticipated. Additionally, this period of regulatory exclusivity does not apply to companies pursuing regulatory approval via their own traditional BLA, rather than via the abbreviated pathway. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td>18 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSet forth below is a comparison of BRTX-100 to Mesoblast's adult stem cell biologic:\nWe believe that BRTX-100 has competitive advantages to Mesoblast's product for the following reasons:\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>The use of autologous cells results in low to no risk of rejection, greater safety profile (introduction of viral/genetic) and streamlined regulatory path </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Hypoxic culturing creates increased cell proliferation, greater plasticity, increased paracrine effect and increased cell survival after application </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Autologous platelet lysate provides growth factors that interact with the cells, allowing for better cell survival </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Low to no risk of safety concerns related to immunological and zoonotic (animal to human) transmission </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Strong runway for value creation with successful clinical results </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCustomers\nUpon regulatory approval, our cell product candidates are intended to be marketed to physicians, other health care professionals, hospitals, research institutions, pharmaceutical companies and the military. It is anticipated that physicians who are trained and skilled in performing spinal injections will be the physicians most likely to treat discs with injections of BRTX-100 upon regulatory approval. These physicians would include interventional physiatrists (physical medicine physicians), pain management anesthesiologists, interventional radiologists and neurosurgeons.\nGovernmental Regulation\nU.S. Government Regulation\nThe health care industry is highly regulated in the United States. The federal government, through various departments and agencies, state and local governments, and private third-party accreditation organizations, regulate and monitor the health care industry, associated products, and operations. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, manufacture, distribution and marketing of medical products, including drugs, biologics, and medical devices. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, post-approval monitoring, advertising, promotion, sampling and import and export of medical products. The following is a general overview of the laws and regulations pertaining to our business.\nTable 54: <table><tr><td>19 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFDA Regulation of Stem Cell Treatment and Products\nThe FDA regulates the manufacture of human stem cell treatments and associated products under the authority of the Public Health Service Act ( PHSA\u201d) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( FDCA\u201d). Stem cells can be regulated under the FDA's Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products Regulations ( HCT/Ps\u201d) or may also be subject to the FDA's drug, biologic, or medical device regulations, each as discussed below.\nHuman Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products Regulation\nUnder Section 361 of the PHSA, the FDA issued specific regulations governing the use of HCT/Ps in humans. Pursuant to Part 1271 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR\u201d) (the HCT/P Regulations\u201d), the FDA established a unified registration and listing system for establishments that manufacture and process HCT/Ps. The regulations also include provisions pertaining to donor eligibility determinations; current good tissue practices covering all stages of production, including harvesting, processing, manufacture, storage, labeling, packaging, and distribution; and other procedures to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases.\nThe HCT/P Regulations define HCT/Ps as articles containing or consisting of human cells or tissues that are intended for implantation, transplantation, infusion or transfer into a human recipient.\u201d The HCT/P Regulations strictly constrain the types of products that may be regulated solely as HCT/P. Factors considered include the degree of manipulation, whether the product is intended for a homologous function, whether the product has been combined with noncellular or non-tissue components, and the product's effect or dependence on the body's metabolic function. In those instances where cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products have been only minimally manipulated, are intended strictly for homologous use, have not been combined with noncellular or nontissue substances, and do not depend on or have any effect on the body's metabolism, the manufacturer is only required to register with the FDA, submit a list of manufactured products, and adopt and implement procedures for the control of communicable diseases. If one or more of the above factors has been exceeded, the product would be regulated as a drug, biological product, or medical device rather than an HCT/P.\nBecause we are an enterprise in the early stages of operations and have not generated significant revenues from operations, it is difficult to anticipate the likely regulatory status of the array of products and services that we may offer. We believe that some of the adult autologous (self derived) stem cells that will be used in our cellular therapy products and services, including the brown adipose (fat) tissue that we intend to use in our ThermoStem Program, may be regulated by the FDA as HCT/Ps under the HCT/P Regulations. However, the FDA may disagree with this position or conclude that some or all of our stem cell therapy products or services do not meet the applicable definitions and exemptions to the regulation. In July, 2020, the FDA issued an updated guidance document entitled Regulatory Considerations for Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products: Minimal Manipulation and Homologous Use\u201d that provides additional guidance on how FDA interprets the HCT/P Regulations, particularly the definition of the terms minimally manipulated\u201d and homologous use.\u201d In the guidance, FDA stated it will exercise enforcement discretion until May 31, 2021 for products that do not comply with the HCT/P Regulations. After that date, manufacturers of products marketed as HCT/Ps that do not comply with the HCT/P Regulations will be subject to immediate FDA enforcement action. If we are not regulated solely under the HCT/P Regulations, we would need to expend significant resources to comply with the FDA's broad regulatory authority under the FDCA. Third party litigation concerning the autologous use of a stem cell mixture to treat musculoskeletal and spinal injuries has increased the likelihood that some of our products and services are likely to be regulated as a drug or biological product and require FDA approval. In past litigation, the FDA asserted that the defendants' use of cultured stem cells without FDA approval is in violation of the FDCA, claiming that the defendants' product is a drug. The defendants asserted that their procedure is part of the practice of medicine and therefore beyond the FDA's regulatory authority. The District Court ruled in favor of the FDA, and in February 2014 the Circuit Court affirmed the District Court's holding.\nIf regulated solely under the FDA's HCT/P statutory and regulatory provisions, once our laboratory in the United States becomes operational, it will need to satisfy the following requirements, among others, to process and store stem cells:\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>registration and listing of HCT/Ps with the FDA; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>donor eligibility determinations, including donor screening and donor testing requirements; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>current good tissue practices, specifically including requirements for the facilities, environmental controls, equipment, supplies and reagents, recovery of HCT/Ps from the patient, processing, storage, labeling and document controls, and distribution and shipment of the HCT/Ps to the laboratory, storage, or other facility; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td>20 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>tracking and traceability of HCT/Ps and equipment, supplies, and reagents used in the manufacture of HCT/Ps; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>adverse event reporting; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>FDA inspection; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>abiding by any FDA order of retention, recall, destruction, and cessation of manufacturing of HCT/Ps. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-reproductive HCT/Ps and non-peripheral blood stem/progenitor cells that are offered for import into the United States and regulated solely under Section 361 of the PHSA must also satisfy the requirements under 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1271.420. Section 1271.420 requires that the importer of record of HCT/Ps notify the FDA prior to, or at the time of, importation and provide sufficient information for the FDA to make an admissibility decision. In addition, the importer must hold the HCT/P intact and under conditions necessary to prevent transmission of communicable disease until an admissibility decision is made by the FDA.\nIf the FDA determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions including public warning letters, fines, consent decrees, orders of retention, recall or destruction of product, orders to cease manufacturing, and criminal prosecution. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect us.\nTo the extent that our cellular therapy activities are limited to developing products and services outside the United States, as described in detail below, the products and services would not be subject to FDA regulation, but will be subject to the applicable requirements of the foreign jurisdiction. We intend to comply with all applicable foreign governmental requirements.\nDrug and Biological Product Regulation\nAn HCT/P product that does not meet the criteria for being solely regulated under Section 361 of the PHSA will be regulated as a drug, device or biological product under the FDCA and/or Section 351 of the PHSA, and applicable FDA regulations. The FDA has broad regulatory authority over drugs and biologics marketed for sale in the United States. The FDA regulates the research, clinical testing, manufacturing, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, distribution, and production of drugs and biological products. The FDA also regulates the export of drugs and biological products manufactured in the United States to international markets in certain situations.\nThe process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:\n\u25cf completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practice ( GLP\u201d) or other applicable regulations;\n\u25cf submission of an IND, which allows clinical trials to begin unless the FDA objects within 30 days;\n\u25cf performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biologic for its intended use or uses conducted in accordance with FDA regulations and Good Clinical Practices ( GCP\u201d), which are international ethical and scientific quality standards meant to ensure that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected and that the integrity of the data is maintained;\n\u25cf registration of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products and certain clinical trial information;\n\u25cf preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application ( NDA\u201d), in the case of a drug or BLA in the case of a biologic;\n\u25cf review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;\nTable 60: <table><tr><td>21 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u25cf satisfactory completion of pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements and of selected clinical trial sites to assess compliance with GCP requirements; and\n\u25cf FDA approval of an NDA or BLA which must occur before a drug or biologic can be marketed or sold.\nApproval of an NDA requires a showing that the drug is safe and effective for its intended use and that the methods, facilities, and controls used for the manufacturing, processing, and packaging of the drug are adequate to preserve its identity, strength, quality, and purity. To obtain a BLA, a manufacturer must show that the proposed product is safe, pure, and potent and that the facility in which the product is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets established quality control standards.\nFor purposes of an NDA or BLA approval by the FDA, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following phases (which may overlap):\n\u25cf Phase 1: The investigational product is initially given to healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. These trials may also provide early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational product's pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.\n\u25cf Phase 2: These clinical trials are conducted in a limited number of human subjects in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the investigational product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and dosage levels. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials.\n\u25cf Phase 3: Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken after Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dosage range of the investigational product appears effective and has a tolerable safety profile. The Phase 2 clinical trials must also provide sufficient information for the design of Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety risks in an expanded human subject population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to further evaluate dosage, effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk profile of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling and approval by the FDA. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of an investigational drug or biologic.\nAll clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations, GCP requirements and their protocols in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. These government regulations may delay or prevent approval of product candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our business operations.\nThe FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials, referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, after a product is approved. Such trials may be made a condition to be satisfied for continuing drug approval. The results of Phase 4 clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. In addition, the FDA has authority to require sponsors to conduct post-marketing trials to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency.\nTable 62: <table><tr><td>22 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnder the Pediatric Research Equity Act ( PREA\u201d), certain NDAs and BLAs and certain supplements to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act ( FDASIA\u201d) amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan ( PSP\u201d) within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.\nChanges to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA, or an NDA or BLA supplement, before the change can be implemented. An NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA and BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs and BLAs.\nDrug and biological products must also comply with applicable requirements, including monitoring and recordkeeping activities, manufacturing requirements, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug's approved labeling, or off-label use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may, in their independent professional medical judgment, prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers typically may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling, or changes of the site of manufacture, are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, who may or may not grant approval or may include a lengthy review process.\nIn the event that the FDA does not regulate our product candidates in the United States solely under the HCT/P regulation, our products and activities could be regulated as drug or biological products under the FDCA. If regulated as drug or biological products, we will need to expend significant resources to ensure regulatory compliance. If an IND and NDA or BLA are required for any of our product candidates, there is no assurance as to whether or when we will receive FDA approval of the product candidate. The process of designing, conducting, compiling and submitting the non-clinical and clinical studies required for NDA or BLA approval is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable. The process can take many years, depending on the product and the FDA's requirements.\nIn addition, even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution or use, or post-marketing trial requirements. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, including safety labeling or imposition of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS\u201d), the requirement to conduct post-market studies or clinical trials or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval for our products, or obtaining approval but for significantly limited use, would harm our business. Further, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future United States or foreign governmental action.\nIf the FDA determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions from public warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals, seizure of our products, total or partial shutdown of our production, withdrawal of approvals, and criminal prosecutions. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect us.\nTable 64: <table><tr><td>23 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFDA Expedited Review Programs\nThe FDA is authorized to expedite the review of NDAs and BLAs in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Drug and biologic products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied.\nIn addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track NDA or BLA before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review.\nAny product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may also be eligible for the following other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review:\n\u25cf Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review, and rolling review.\n\u25cf Priority review. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, it would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition compared to marketed products. The FDA aims to complete its review of priority review applications within six months as opposed to ten months for standard review.\n\u25cf Accelerated approval. Drug or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials.\nFast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.\nFurther, with the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act (the Cures Act\u201d) in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine advanced therapy ( RMAT\u201d) (which may include a cell therapy) that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a RMAT designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.\nMedical Device Regulation\nThe FDA also has broad authority over the regulation of medical devices marketed for sale in the United States. The FDA regulates the research, clinical testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, promotion, distribution, and production of medical devices. The FDA also regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the United States to international markets.\nUnder the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes, Class I, Class II, or Class III, depending upon the degree of risk associated with the medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are subject to the lowest degree of regulatory scrutiny because they are considered low risk devices and need only comply with the FDA's General Controls. The General Controls include compliance with the registration, listing, adverse event reporting requirements, and applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation as well as the general misbranding and adulteration prohibitions.\nTable 66: <table><tr><td>24 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nClass II devices are subject to the General Controls as well as certain Special Controls such as 510(k) premarket notification. Class III devices are subject to the highest degree of regulatory scrutiny and typically include life supporting and life sustaining devices and implants. They are subject to the General Controls and Special Controls that include a premarket approval application ( PMA\u201d). New\u201d devices are automatically regulated as Class III devices unless they are shown to be low risk, in which case they may be subject to de novo review to be moved to Class I or Class II. Clinical research of an investigational device is subject to the FDA's Investigational Device Exemption ( IDE\u201d) regulations. Nonsignificant risk devices are subject to abbreviated requirements that do not require a submission to the FDA but must have Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and comply with other requirements pertaining to informed consent, labeling, recordkeeping, reporting, and monitoring. Significant risk devices require the submission of an IDE application to the FDA and the FDA's approval of the IDE application.\nThe FDA premarket clearance and approval process can be lengthy, expensive and uncertain. It generally takes three to twelve months from submission to obtain 510(k) premarket clearance, although it may take longer. Approval of a PMA could take one to four years, or more, from the time the application is submitted and there is no guarantee of ultimate clearance or approval. Securing FDA clearances and approvals may require the submission of extensive clinical data and supporting information to the FDA. Additionally, the FDA actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing and promotion of devices for indications or uses that have not been cleared or approved by the FDA. In addition, modifications or enhancements of products that could affect the safety or effectiveness or effect a major change in the intended use of a device that was either cleared through the 510(k) process or approved through the PMA process may require further FDA review through new 510(k) or PMA submissions.\nIn the event we develop processes, products or services which qualify as medical devices subject to FDA regulation, we intend to comply with such regulations. If the FDA determines that our products are regulated as medical devices and we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions from public warning letters, application integrity proceedings, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals, seizure of our products, total or partial shutdown of our production, withdrawal of approvals, and criminal prosecutions. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect us.\nCurrent Good Manufacturing Practices and other FDA Regulations of Cellular Therapy Products\nProducts that fall outside of the HCT/P regulations and are regulated as drugs, biological products, or devices must comply with applicable cGMP regulations. These cGMPs and related quality standards are designed to ensure the products that are processed at a facility meet the FDA's applicable requirements for identity, strength, quality, sterility, purity, and safety. In the event that our domestic United States operations are subject to the FDA's drug, biological product, or device regulations, we intend to comply with the applicable cGMPs and quality regulations.\nIf the FDA determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions from public warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals, seizure of our products, total or partial shutdown of our production, withdrawal of approvals, and criminal prosecutions. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect us.\nPromotion of Foreign-Based Cellular Therapy Treatment- Medical Tourism\u201d\nWe may establish, or license technology to third parties in connection with their establishment of, adult stem cell therapy facilities outside the United States. We also intend to work with hospitals and physicians to make the stem cell-based therapies available for patients who travel outside the United States for treatment. Medical tourism\u201d is defined as the practice of traveling across international borders to obtain health care.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (the FTC\u201d) has the authority to regulate and police advertising of medical treatments, procedures, and regimens in the United States under the Federal Trade Commission Act, or the FTCA. The FTC has regulatory authority to prevent unfair and deceptive practices and false advertising. Specifically, the FTC requires advertisers and promoters to have a reasonable basis to substantiate and support claims. The FTC has many enforcement powers, one of which is the power to order disgorgement by promoters deemed in violation of the FTCA of any profits made from the promoted business and can order injunctions from further violative promotion. Advertising that we may utilize in connection with our medical tourism operations will be subject to FTC regulatory authority, and we intend to comply with such regulatory r\u00e9gime. Similar laws and requirements are likely to exist in other countries and we intend to comply with such requirements.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td>25 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFederal Regulation of Clinical Laboratories\nCongress passed the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, in 1988, which provided the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d) authority over all laboratory testing, except research, that is performed on humans in the United States. The Division of Laboratory Services, within the Survey and Certification Group, under the Center for Medicaid and State Operations ( CMSO\u201d) has the responsibility for implementing the CLIA program.\nThe CLIA program is designed to establish quality laboratory testing by ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of patient test results. Under CLIA, a laboratory is a facility that does laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans and used to provide information for the diagnosis, prevention, treatment of disease, or impairment of, or assessment of health. Laboratories that handle stem cells and other biologic matter are, therefore, included under the CLIA program. Under the CLIA program, laboratories must be certified by the government, satisfy governmental quality and personnel standards, undergo proficiency testing, be subject to inspections, and pay fees. To the extent that our business activities require CLIA certification, we intend to obtain and maintain such certification. If we are subject to CLIA, the failure to comply with CLIA standards could result in suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory's CLIA certificate. In addition, fines or criminal penalties could also be levied. If any of these events were to occur, it could impact our business operations.\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-Protection of Patient Health Information\nWe may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA\u201d), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ( HITECH\u201d) and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on certain types of individuals and organizations. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other and from HIPAA in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Further, we may need to also comply with additional federal or state privacy laws and regulations that may apply to certain diagnoses, such as HIV/AIDS, to the extent that they apply to us.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS\u201d), through its Office for Civil Rights, investigates breach reports and determines whether administrative or technical modifications are required and whether civil or criminal sanctions should be imposed. Companies failing to comply with HIPAA and the implementing regulations may also be subject to civil money penalties or in the case of knowing violations, potential criminal penalties, including monetary fines, imprisonment, or both. In some cases, the State Attorneys General may seek enforcement and appropriate sanctions in federal court.\nOther Applicable U.S. Laws\nIn addition to the above-described regulation by United States federal and state government, the following are other federal and state laws and regulations that could directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate the business:\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>state and local licensure, registration, and regulation of the development of pharmaceuticals and biologics; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>state and local licensure of medical professionals; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>state statutes and regulations related to the corporate practice of medicine; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>laws and regulations administered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection related to the importation of biological material into the United States; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td>26 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>other laws and regulations administered by the FDA; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>other laws and regulations administered by HHS; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>state and local laws and regulations governing human subject research and clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the federal physician self-referral prohibition, also known as Stark Law, and any state equivalents to Stark Law; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the federal False Claims Act ( FCA\u201d); </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the federal Anti-Kickback Statute ( AKS\u201d) and any state equivalent statutes and regulations; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>federal and state coverage and reimbursement laws and regulations; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>state and local laws and regulations for the disposal and handling of medical waste and biohazardous material; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA\u201d) regulations and requirements; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the Intermediate Sanctions rules of the IRS providing for potential financial sanctions with respect to excess benefit transactions\u201d with tax-exempt organizations; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (in the event that our products are classified as drugs, biologics, devices or medical supplies and are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program); </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>state and other federal laws addressing the privacy of health information; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare professionals and other potential referral sources, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare professionals or marketing expenditures, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nViolation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations may result in penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment. Furthermore, efforts to ensure that business activities and business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can be costly for manufacturers of branded prescription products.\nForeign Government Regulation\nIn general, we will need to comply with the government regulations of each individual country in which our therapy centers are located and products are to be distributed and sold. These regulations vary in complexity and can be as stringent, and on occasion even more stringent, than FDA regulations in the United States. Due to the fact that there are new and emerging cell therapy regulations that have recently been drafted and/or implemented in various countries around the world, the application and subsequent implementation of these new and emerging regulations have little to no precedence. Therefore, the level of complexity and stringency is not always precisely understood for each country, creating greater uncertainty for the international regulatory process. Furthermore, government regulations can change with little to no notice and may result in up-regulation of our product(s), thereby creating a greater regulatory burden for our cell processing technology products. We have not yet thoroughly explored the applicable laws and regulations that we will need to comply with in foreign jurisdictions. It is possible that we may not be permitted to expand our business into one or more foreign jurisdictions.\nTable 74: <table><tr><td>27 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe do not have any definitive plans or arrangements with respect to the establishment by us of stem cell therapy clinics in any country.

We are currently pursuing our Disc/Spine Program with our initial investigational therapeutic product being called BRTX-100. We submitted an IND application to the FDA to obtain authorization to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial investigating the use of BRTX-100, our lead cell therapy candidate, in the treatment of chronic lower back pain arising from degenerative disc disease. We have received such authorization from the FDA. We intend to commence such clinical trial during the third quarter of 2021 (assuming the receipt of necessary funding). We have obtained a license to use technology for investigational adult stem cell treatment of disc and spine conditions, including protruding and bulging lumbar discs. The technology is an advanced stem cell injection procedure that may offer relief from lower back pain, buttock and leg pain, and numbness and tingling in the leg and foot. We are also developing our ThermoStem Program. This pre-clinical program involves the use of brown adipose (fat) in connection with the cell-based treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity as well as hypertension, other metabolic disorders and cardiac deficiencies. United States patents related to the ThermoStem Program were issued in September 2015, January 2019, and March 2020; a notice of allowance was issued in November 2020 for a United States patent application in the ThermoStem Program and is expected to issue in 2021; Australian patents related to the ThermoStem Program were issued in April 2017 and October 2019; a Japanese patent related to the ThermoStem Program was issued in December 2017; Israeli patents related to the ThermoStem Program were issued in October 2019 and May 2020; and European patents related to the ThermoStem Program were issued in April 2020 and January 2021.\nWe have licensed a patented curved needle device that is a needle system designed to deliver cells and/or other therapeutic products or materials to the spine and discs or other potential sites. We anticipate that FDA approval or clearance will be necessary for this device prior to commercialization. We do not intend to utilize this device in connection with our contemplated Phase 2 clinical trial with regard to BRTX-100.\nOur offices are located in Melville, New York where we have established a laboratory facility in order to increase our capabilities for the further development of possible cellular-based treatments, products and protocols, stem cell-related intellectual property and translational research applications.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our accumulated deficit was $78,570,146, our stockholders' deficit was $12,776,146 and our working capital deficiency was $13,651,716. We have historically only generated a modest amount of revenue, and our losses have principally been operating expenses incurred in research and development, marketing and promotional activities in order to commercialize our products and services, plus costs associated with meeting the requirements of being a public company. We expect to continue to incur substantial costs for these activities over at least the next year.\nBased upon our working capital deficiency as of December 31, 2019, and our forecast for continued operating losses, as of such date, we required equity and/or debt financing to continue our operations. As of December 31, 2019, our outstanding debt of $8,393,327, together with interest at rates ranging between 12% and 15% per annum, was due on various dates through December 18, 2020.\nAs discussed in Item 1 of this Annual Report ( Business - Business Development\u201d), on March 20, 2020, we filed a voluntary petition commencing a case under chapter 11 of title 11 of the U.S. Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York. On October 30, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the plan of reorganization and, on November 16, 2020, the plan became effective. As a result of the confirmed plan of reorganization $14,796,000 in outstanding debt and liabilities were exchanged for (i) shares of common stock, (ii) new convertible debt or (iii) new convertible debt and warrants to purchase common stock.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td>31 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe anticipate that we will require approximately $12,000,000 in financing to commence and complete a Phase 2 clinical trial with regard to our Disc/Spine Program. We anticipate that we will require approximately $45,000,000 in further additional funding to complete such clinical trials (assuming the receipt of no revenues). We will also require a substantial amount of additional funding if we determine to establish a manufacturing operation with regard to our Disc/Spine Program (as opposed to utilizing a third party manufacturer) and to implement our other programs described in Item 1 of this Annual Report ( Business\u201d), including our metabolic ThermoStem Program, repay our outstanding debt (assuming such debt is not converted into equity) and fund general operations. No assurance can be given that the anticipated amounts of required funding are correct or that we will be able to accomplish our goals within the timeframes projected. In addition, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain any required financing on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise.\nWe are currently seeking several different financing alternatives to support our future operations. The plan of reorganization provides that, at such time as we are current in our periodic SEC filings, subject to certain customary conditions, Auctus Fund, LLC ( Auctus\u201d), which provided debtor-in-possession ( DIP\u201d) financing to us during the reorganization process, is to provide a loan to us, as needed, in an amount equal to $3,500,000 less the sum of the DIP loans previously made by Auctus to us (inclusive of accrued interest, of $1,226,901) and the costs incurred by Auctus as the DIP lender. In addition, Auctus and others provided debt financing in the aggregate principal amount of $3,848,548 at the effective date of our plan of reorganization. If we are unable to obtain such financing on a timely basis or other required financing as needed, we may have to curtail our development, marketing and promotional activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately we could be forced to discontinue our operations and liquidate. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe following table presents selected items in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For The Years Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>111,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating Expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketing and promotion </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>321,280 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>352,204 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consulting </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,912,683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,870,829 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,722,338 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,513,150 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,605,704 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,022,469 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Operating Expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,562,005 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,758,652 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss From Operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,432,005 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,647,652 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other (Expense) Income: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,467,952 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(932,187 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amortization of debt discount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,671,087 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,289,591 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on extinguishment of notes payable, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,895,116 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,415,950 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in fair value of derivative liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>788,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(229,323 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Warrant modification expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,100 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Other Expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,215,885 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,870,151 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net Loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,647,890 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,517,803 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td>32 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we generated $130,000 and $111,000, respectively, of royalty revenue in connection with our sublicense agreement.\nMarketing and promotion\nMarketing and promotion expenses include advertising and promotion, marketing and seminars, meals, entertainment and travel expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, marketing and promotion expenses remained relatively consistent and decreased by $30,924, or 9%, from $352,204 to $321,280 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe expect that marketing and promotion expenses will increase in the future as we increase our marketing activities following full commercialization of our products and services.\nConsulting\nConsulting expenses consist of consulting fees and stock-based compensation to consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2019, consulting expenses remained relatively consistent and increased by $41,854, or 2%, from $1,870,829 to $1,912,683, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses include cash and non-cash compensation of (a) our Vice President of Research and Development; (b) our Scientific Advisory Board members; and (c) laboratory staff and costs related to our brown fat and disc/spine initiatives. Research and development expenses are expensed as they are incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2019, research and development expenses increased by $209,188, or 14%, from $1,513,150 to $1,722,338, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily a result of an increase of approximately $82,067 in stock-based compensation expense primarily related to options issued to our Scientific Advisory Board members, incremental modification expense related to an option repricing in 2019, and an increase in laboratory staffing.\nWe expect that our research and development expenses will increase with the continuation of the aforementioned initiatives.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, payroll taxes, severance costs and stock-based compensation to employees (excluding any cash or non-cash compensation of our Vice President of Research and Development and our laboratory staff), as well as corporate expenses such as legal and professional fees, investor relations and occupancy related expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, general and administrative expenses increased by $583,235, or 15%, from $4,022,469 to $4,605,704, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily due to an increase of approximately $818,000 in professional financial and legal fees related primarily to matters regarding fundings and conversions of debt, as well as an increase in corporate expenses, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $254,000 in stock-based compensation due to fewer outstanding options in 2019.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we expand our staff, develop our infrastructure and incur additional costs to support the growth of our business.\nInterest expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, interest expense increased $535,765, or 57%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was due to an increase in interest-bearing short-term borrowings as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTable 97: <table><tr><td>33 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmortization of debt discount\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, amortization of debt discount increased $1,381,496, or 60%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased issuances of convertible notes and the timing of the recognition of expense related to the bifurcated embedded conversion options of convertible notes.\nLoss on extinguishment of notes payable, net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of notes payable, net, of $1,895,116, as compared to a loss on extinguishment of notes payable, net of $1,415,950 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is associated with debt repayments and debtholders' exchanges of debt into equity securities resulting in a loss on the exchange.\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a gain related to the change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $788,970 due to the decrease in time value of embedded conversion options within certain convertible notes payable, as compared to a loss related to the change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $229,323 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nWe measure our liquidity in a number of ways, including the following:\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,523 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Working Capital Deficiency </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13,651,716 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,073,901 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Notes Payable (Gross) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,393,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,161,916 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAvailability of Additional Funds\nBased upon our working capital deficiency and stockholders' deficit of $13,651,716 and $12,776,146, respectively, as of December 31, 2019, as of such date, we required additional equity and/or debt financing to continue our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our outstanding debt of $8,393,327, together with interest at rates ranging between 12% and 15% per annum, was due on various dates through December 18, 2020.\nOur operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including our ability to successfully commercialize our products and services, competing technological and market developments, and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings.\nWe may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it or raise capital on favorable terms. Debt financing may require us to pledge certain assets and enter into covenants that could restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our stockholders or us. If we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms, we may be required to significantly curtail or discontinue operations or obtain funds by entering into financing agreements on unattractive terms.\nOur consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nTable 100: <table><tr><td>34 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following has been able to mitigate the above factors with regards to our ability to continue as a going concern: (i) as part of our Chapter 11 reorganization approximately $14,700,000 in outstanding debt and other liabilities were exchanged for (a) shares of common stock, (b) new convertible notes or (c) new convertible notes and warrants to purchase shares of common stock; (ii) we secured DIP financing during our Chapter 11 reorganization in the aggregate amount of $1,189,413, and $3,848,548 in debt financing as part of our Chapter 11 reorganization to sustain operations; (iii) we obtained equity and debt financing in the aggregate amount of $451,762 subsequent to December 31, 2019 and prior to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Case; and (iv) pursuant to the plan of reorganization, Auctus is required to loan to us, as needed and subject to our becoming current in our SEC reporting obligations, an additional amount equal to $3,500,000, less the amount of Auctus' DIP financing ($1,226,901, inclusive of accrued interest) and its DIP costs. As a result of the above, we have sufficient cash to fund operations for the twelve months subsequent to the filing date. In addition, the Company will need to obtain further funding of at least $12,000,000 to commence and complete a Phase 2 clinical study of the use of BRTX-100.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our sources and uses of cash were as follows:\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nWe experienced negative cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 in the amounts of $6,918,734 and $5,104,629, respectively. The net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to cash used to fund a net loss of $14,647,890, adjusted for non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of $7,189,303 partially offset by $539,853 of cash generated by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities, primarily as a result of increases in accrued interest, expenses, and other current liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable. The net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to cash used to fund a net loss of $12,517,803, adjusted for non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of $7,458,950 partially offset by $45,776 of cash generated by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities, primarily as a result of increases in accrued interest, expenses, and other current liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, cash used in investing activities was $35,631 and $12,869, respectively, due to cash used for the purchase of office and computer equipment.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $6,838,505 and $4,783,341, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, $10,888,339 of net proceeds were from debt financings, $1,658,500 of net proceeds were from equity financings, partially offset by $5,708,334 of repayments on debt financings and prepayment premiums. During the year ended December 31, 2018, $4,194,173 of net proceeds were from debt financings and other borrowings and $589,168 of net proceeds were from equity financings (including proceeds received in connection with the exercise of common stock purchase warrants) partially offset by $863,302 of repayments on debt financings.\nWe anticipate that the costs to commence and complete our Phase 2 clinical trials with regard to our Disc/Spine Program will be at least $12,000,000. In addition, we anticipate approximately $45,000,000 in additional funding will be needed to complete the clinical trials using BRTX-100 (assuming the receipt of no revenues). As noted above in Availability of Additional Funds\u201d we secured additional funding as part of Chapter 11 reorganization in the aggregate amount of $5,037,961 as well as approximately $14,700,000 in outstanding debt and other liabilities being exchanged for (a) shares of common stock, (b) new convertible notes or (c) new convertible notes and warrants to purchase shares of common stock. Additionally, pursuant to the plan of reorganization, Auctus is required to loan to us, as needed and subject to our becoming current in our SEC reporting obligations, an additional amount equal to $3,500,000, less the amount of Auctus' DIP financing ($1,226,901, inclusive of accrued interest) and its DIP costs. As a result of the above, we have sufficient cash to fund operations for the twelve months subsequent to the filing date.\nTable 102: <table><tr><td>35 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods. Our significant estimates and assumptions include the recoverability and useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair value of our common stock, stock-based compensation, warrants issued in connection with notes payable, derivative liabilities and the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets. Certain of our estimates, including the carrying amount of the intangible assets, could be affected by external conditions, including those unique to us and general economic conditions. It is reasonably possible that these external factors could have an effect on our estimates and could cause actual results to differ from those estimates.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are comprised of trademarks and licenses with original estimated useful lives of 10 and 17.7 years, respectively. Once placed into service, we amortize the cost of the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe review for the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. While our near term liquidity is tight, historically we have been successful in raising capital as needed (although there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in raising capital as needed). We continue to progress our scientific agenda and meet related milestones. We have not identified any impairment losses.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of items that have been included or excluded in our financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts, or temporary differences, at enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.\nWe adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 740-10, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statements recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. For employees and directors, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is generally re-measured on vesting dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value amount is then recognized over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. Since the shares underlying our Equity Participation Plan were registered on May 27, 2014, we estimate the fair value of the awards granted under the Plan based on the market value of our freely tradable common stock as reported on the OTC. The fair value of our restricted equity instruments was estimated by management based on observations of the cash sales prices of both restricted shares and freely tradable shares. Awards granted to directors are treated on the same basis as awards granted to employees.\nTable 104: <table><tr><td>36 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe evaluate our convertible instruments to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivative financial instruments to be separately accounted for in accordance with Topic 815 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) ASC. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that we record embedded conversion options ( ECOs\u201d) and any related freestanding instruments at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. Conversion options are recorded as a discount to the host instrument and are amortized as amortization of debt discount on the consolidated financial statements over the life of the underlying instrument. We reassess the classification of our derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification.\nThe Multinomial Lattice Model and Black-Scholes Model were used to estimate the fair value of the ECOs of convertible notes payable, the warrants, and stock options that are classified as derivative liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The models include subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. The expected volatility is estimated based on the actual volatility during the most recent historical period of time equal to the weighted average life of the instruments.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nFactors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition\nThe risk factors listed in this section provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. Readers should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nRisks Related to Our Business Generally\nWe have a limited operating history; we have incurred substantial losses since inception; we expect to continue to incur losses for the near term; as of December 31, 2019, we had a substantial working capital deficiency and a stockholders' deficiency and, as a consequence, on March 20, 2020, we filed a voluntary petition commencing a case under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nWe have a limited operating history. Since our inception, we have incurred net losses. As of December 31, 2019, we had a working capital deficiency of $13,651,716 and stockholders' deficit of $12,776,146. As a consequence, on March 20, 2020, we filed a voluntary petition commencing a case under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the Chapter 11 Case\u201d). On October 30, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the plan of reorganization pursuant to the Chapter 11 Case (the Plan of Reorganization\u201d) and on November 16, 2020, the Plan of Reorganization became effective.\nTable 106: <table><tr><td>37 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe will need to obtain a significant amount of financing to initiate and complete our clinical trials and implement our business plan.\nSince our inception, we have not generated significant revenues from our operations and have funded our operations through the sale of our equity securities and debt securities. The implementation of our business plan, as discussed in Item 1 ( Business\u201d), will require the receipt of sufficient equity and/or debt financing to purchase necessary equipment, technology and materials, fund our clinical trials and other research and development efforts, retire our outstanding debt and otherwise fund our operations. We anticipate that we will require approximately $12,000,000 in financing to commence and complete a Phase 2 clinical trial using BRTX-100. We anticipate that we will require approximately $45,000,000 in further additional funding to complete our clinical trials using BRTX-100 (assuming the receipt of no revenues). We will also require a substantial amount of additional funding to implement our other programs described in Item 1 ( Business\u201d), including our metabolic ThermoStem Program, repay our outstanding debt (assuming such debt is not converted into equity) and fund general operations. We received debtor-in-possession ( DIP\u201d) funding of $1,189,413 during the Chapter 11 Case and debt financing of $3,848,548 on the effective date of the Chapter 11 Case. The Plan of Reorganization provides for additional debt funding of $3,500,000 (less our DIP funding obligation, including accrued interest, of $1,226,901 at the effective date of the Chapter 11 Case, less DIP costs incurred by the DIP lender) as needed, from our DIP lender upon our becoming current in our SEC periodic report filings. The filing of this Annual Report will not satisfy such requirement as to being current with SEC filings. Such additional funding from the DIP lender, if received, will not be sufficient to satisfy our needs. No assurance can be given that the anticipated amounts of required funding are correct or that we will be able to accomplish our goals within the timeframes projected. In addition, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain any required financing on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise. In the event we do not obtain the financing required for the above purposes, we may have to curtail our development, marketing and promotional activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately we could be forced to discontinue our operations and liquidate.\nWe may need to obtain additional financing to satisfy debt obligations. An event of default pursuant to our outstanding debt obligations could trigger an acceleration of the due date of such obligations, including our secured debt.\nAs described in this Item 7 ( Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Availability of Additional Funds\u201d), as of December 31, 2019, our outstanding debt of $8,393,327, together with interest at rates ranging between 12 and 15% per annum, was due on various dates through December 18, 2020. As a consequence of such outstanding debt, as discussed above, on March 20, 2020, we commenced the Chapter 11 Case. Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, we issued 1,049,726,797 shares of common stock in exchange for unsecured claims of approximately $10,497,267. In addition, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, we have issued debt securities in the aggregate principal amount of $9,642,418 and, as indicated above, the DIP lender is required, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, to lend us an additional $3,500,000 (less our DIP funding obligation, including accrued interest, of $1,226,901 at the effective date of the Chapter 11 Case, less DIP costs incurred by the DIP lender), as needed. All such debt is repayable three years from the date of issuance (unless sooner converted into equity); however, an event of default pursuant to the secured and unsecured promissory notes evidencing such indebtedness could trigger an acceleration of the due dates of all of the notes. We do not have the financial resources to satisfy such debt obligations. Since the repayment of a substantial portion of our outstanding debt is secured by a security interest in all of our assets, in the event of a default, and foreclosure upon our assets, we could be forced to cease operations and liquidate.\nOur business strategy is high risk.\nWe are focusing our resources and efforts primarily on the development of cellular-based products and services which will require extensive cash for research, development and commercialization activities. This is a high-risk strategy because there is no assurance that our products and services, including our Disc/Spine Program and our ThermoStem metabolic brown fat research initiative, will ever become commercially viable (commercial risk), that we will prevent other companies from depriving us of market share and profit margins by offering services and products based on our inventions and developments (legal risk), that we will successfully manage a company in a new area of business, regenerative medicine, and on a different scale than we have operated in the past (operational risk), that we will be able to achieve the desired therapeutic results using stem and regenerative cells (scientific risk), or that our cash resources will be adequate to develop our products and services until we become profitable, if ever (financial risk). We are using our cash in one of the riskiest industries in the economy (strategic risk). This may make our securities an unsuitable investment for many investors.\nWe will need to enter into agreements in order to implement our business strategy.\nExcept for a certain license agreement with Regenerative Sciences, LLC described in Item 1 ( Business - Disc/Spine Program - License\u201d), we do not have any material agreements or understandings in place with respect to the implementation of our business strategy. No assurances can be given that we will be able to enter into any necessary agreements with respect to the development of our business. Our inability to enter into any such agreements would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td>38 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe depend on our executive officers and on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel; we do not currently have a Chief Financial Officer.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance of Lance Alstodt, our Chief Executive Officer. We rely upon him for strategic business decisions and guidance. Mr. Alstodt is not subject to an employment agreement with us. We are also dependent on the performance of Francisco Silva, our Vice President of Research and Development. Mr. Silva is subject to an employment agreement with us. We do not have any key-man insurance policies on the lives of either of our executive officers. We do not currently have a Chief Financial Officer. Pending the hiring of a Chief Financial Officer, we are utilizing financial consultants with regard to the preparation of our financial statements. We believe that our future success in developing marketable products and services and achieving a competitive position will depend in large part upon whether we can attract and retain additional qualified management and scientific personnel, including a Chief Financial Officer. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel. The loss of the services of Mr. Alstodt and/or Mr. Silva or the inability to attract and retain additional personnel, including a Chief Financial Officer, and develop expertise as needed would have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our results of operations and prospects.\nBeginning in March 2020, the global pandemic related to the novel coronavirus COVID-19 began to impact the global economy. Because of the size and breadth of this pandemic, all of the direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 are not yet known and may not emerge for some time. Risks presented by the ongoing effects of COVID-19 include, among others, the following:\nClinical Trials. We anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact our contemplated clinical trials. Due to the worldwide efforts being taken to combat COVID-19 and the increased clinical work being done in this respect, we believe that it may be difficult for certain needed laboratory supplies, equipment and other materials to be obtained in order to conduct our clinical trials. We also anticipate that, due to a fear of COVID-19 transmission, there may be a hesitancy on the part of certain individuals to become clinical trial participants. We hope that these possible negative effects will lessen as more of the population becomes vaccinated; however, the impact that the vaccinations will have is uncertain at this time.\nAdverse Legislative and/or Regulatory Action. Federal, state and local government actions to address and contain the impact of COVID-19 may adversely affect us. For example, we may be subject to legislative and/or regulatory action that negatively impacts the manner in which the clinical trials may be conducted.\nOperational Disruptions and Heightened Cybersecurity Risks. Our operations could be disrupted if key members of our senior management or a significant percentage of our workforce are unable to continue to work because of illness, government directives or otherwise. In addition, in connection with increased remote working arrangements, we face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents and are more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities.\nRisks Related to Our Cell Therapy Product Development Efforts\nOur future success is significantly dependent on the timely and successful development and commercialization of BRTX-100, our lead product candidate for the treatment of chronic lumbar disc disease; if we encounter delays or difficulties in the development of this product candidate, as well as any other product candidates, our business prospects would be significantly harmed.\nWe are dependent upon the successful development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates. Before we are able to seek regulatory approval of our product candidates, we must conduct and complete extensive clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy in humans. Our lead product candidate, BRTX-100, is in early stages of development and we have not yet commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial using BRTX-100 to treat chronic lower back pain due to degenerative disc disease related to protruding/bulging discs.\nTable 110: <table><tr><td>39 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, and can take many years to complete. Importantly, a failure of one or more of these or any other clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to complete our clinical studies, receive regulatory approval or commercialize our cell therapy product candidates, including the following:\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>suspensions, delays or changes in the design, initiation, enrollment, implementation or completion of required clinical trials;

clinical trial results that are negative, inconclusive or less than desired as to safety and/or efficacy, which could result in the need for additional clinical studies or the termination of the product's development;

In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may be required, or we may elect, to conduct additional studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical study delays could also shorten any periods during which our products have patent protection and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nEven if we are able to successfully complete our clinical development program for our product candidates, and ultimately receive regulatory approval to market one or more of the products, we may, among other things:\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as the indications we sought; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>encounter issues with respect to the manufacturing of commercial supplies; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; and/or </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>be subject to restrictions on how the product is distributed or used. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe anticipate that we will not be able to commercialize our BRTX-100 product candidate for at least five years.\nWe may experience delays and other difficulties in enrolling a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials which could delay or prevent the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals.\nWe may not be able to initiate or complete as planned any clinical trials if we are unable to identify and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. We also may be unable to engage a sufficient number of clinical trial sites to conduct our trials.\nWe may face challenges in enrolling patients to participate in our clinical trials due to the novelty of our cell-based therapies, the size of the patient populations and the eligibility criteria for enrollment in the trial. In addition, some patients may have concerns regarding cell therapy that may negatively affect their perception of therapies under development and their decision to enroll in the trials. Furthermore, patients suffering from diseases within target indications may enroll in competing clinical trials, which could negatively affect our ability to complete enrollment of our trials. Enrollment challenges in clinical trials often result in increased development costs for a product candidate, significant delays and potentially the abandonment of the clinical trial.\nWe may have other delays in completing our clinical trials and we may not complete them at all.\nWe have not commenced the clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA approval to market our product candidate, BRTX-100, or any of our other product candidates in development. Since our Company lacks significant experience in completing clinical trials and bringing a drug through commercialization, we have hired outside consultants with such experience. Clinical trials for BRTX-100 and other product candidates in development may be delayed or terminated as a result of many factors, including the following:\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>patients failing to complete clinical trials due to dissatisfaction with the treatment, side effects or other reasons; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>failure by regulators to authorize us to commence a clinical trial; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>suspension or termination by regulators of clinical research for many reasons, including concerns about patient safety, the failure of study sites and/or investigators in our clinical research program to comply with GCP requirements, or our failure, or the failure of our contract manufacturers, to comply with current cGMP requirements; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>delays or failure to obtain clinical supply for our products necessary to conduct clinical trials from contract manufacturers; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td>41 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>treatment candidates demonstrating a lack of efficacy during clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>treatment candidates demonstrating significant safety signals; and/or </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>inability to continue to fund clinical trials or to find a partner to fund the clinical trials. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAny delay or failure to complete clinical trials and obtain FDA approval for our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our cost to develop and commercialize, and our ability to generate revenue from, a particular product candidate.\nThe development of our cell therapy product candidates is subject to uncertainty because autologous cell therapy is inherently variable.\nWhen manufacturing an autologous cell therapy, the number and composition of the cell population varies from patient to patient. Such variability in the number and composition of these cells could adversely affect our ability to manufacture autologous cell therapies in a cost-effective or profitable manner and meet acceptable product release specifications for use in a clinical trial or, if approved, for commercial sale. As a consequence, the development and regulatory approval process for autologous cell therapy products could be delayed or may never be completed.\nAny disruption to our access to the media (including cell culture media) and reagents we are using in the clinical development of our cell therapy product candidates could adversely affect our ability to perform clinical trials and seek future regulatory submissions.\nCertain media (including cell culture media) and reagents, as well as devices, materials and systems, that we intend to use in our planned clinical trials, and that we may need or use in commercial production, are provided by unaffiliated third parties. Any lack of continued availability of these media, reagents, devices, materials and systems for any reason would have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete these studies and could adversely impact our ability to achieve commercial manufacture of our planned therapeutic products. Although other available sources for these media, reagents, devices, materials and systems may exist in the marketplace, we have not evaluated their cost, effectiveness, or intellectual property foundation and therefore cannot guarantee the suitability or availability of such other potential sources.\nProducts that appear promising in research and development may be delayed or may fail to reach later stages of clinical development.\nThe successful development of cellular based products is highly uncertain. Product candidates that appear promising in preclinical and early research and development may be delayed or fail to reach later stages of development. Decisions regarding the further development of product candidates must be made with limited and incomplete data, which makes it difficult to ensure or even accurately predict whether the allocation of limited resources and the expenditure of additional capital on specific product candidates will result in desired outcomes. Pre-clinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways, and negative or inconclusive results or adverse events during a clinical trial could delay, limit or prevent the development of a product candidate. Positive preclinical data may not continue or occur for future subjects in our clinical studies and may not be repeated or observed in ongoing or future studies involving our product candidates. Furthermore, our product candidates may also fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in later stages of clinical development despite having successfully advanced through initial clinical studies. In addition, regulatory delays or rejections may be encountered as a result of many factors, including changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development.\nOur clinical trials may fail to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, which would prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization.\nThe clinical trials of our product candidates are, and the manufacturing and marketing of our products will be, subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and in other countries where we intend to test and market our product candidates. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate through lengthy, complex and expensive preclinical testing and clinical trials that our product candidates are both safe and effective for use in each target indication. In particular, because our product candidates are subject to regulation as biological drug products, we will need to demonstrate that they are safe, pure, and potent for use in their target indications. Each product candidate must demonstrate an adequate risk versus benefit profile in its intended patient population and for its intended use. The risk/benefit profile required for product licensure will vary depending on these factors and may include decrease or elimination of pain, adequate duration of response, a delay in the progression of the disease, an improvement in function and/or decrease in disability.\nTable 120: <table><tr><td>42 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, even if such trials are successfully completed, we cannot guarantee that the FDA will interpret the results as we do, and more trials could be required before we submit our product candidates for approval. To the extent that the results of the trials are not satisfactory to the FDA for support of a marketing application, we may be required to expend significant resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of our product candidates.\nEven if we complete the necessary clinical trials, we cannot predict when, or if, we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate, and the approval may be for a narrower indication than we seek.\nWe cannot commercialize a product candidate until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the product candidate. Even if our product candidates meet their safety and efficacy endpoints in clinical trials, the regulatory authorities may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval. Additional delays may result if an FDA Advisory Committee or other regulatory authority recommends non-approval or restrictions or conditions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory authority policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and the review process. Regulatory authorities also may approve a product candidate for more limited indications than requested or they may impose significant limitations in the form of narrow indications, contraindications or a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS\u201d). These regulatory authorities may require warnings or precautions with respect to conditions of use or they may grant approval subject to the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, regulatory authorities may not approve the labeling claims or allow the promotional claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may never obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates in the United States and, even if we do, we may never obtain approval for or commercialize any of our product candidates in any foreign jurisdiction, which would limit our ability to realize our full market potential.\nIn order to eventually market any of our product candidates in any particular foreign jurisdiction, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements regarding safety and efficacy on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. Approval by the FDA in the United States, if obtained, does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions. In addition, preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other country.\nApproval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our product candidates in those countries. The foreign regulatory approval process involves similar risks to those associated with FDA approval. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including international markets, nor have we attempted to obtain such approval. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products may be unrealized.\nWe presently lack manufacturing capabilities to produce our product candidates at commercial scale quantities and do not have an alternate manufacturing supply, which could negatively impact our ability to meet any future demand for the products.\nCurrently, we expect our laboratory (or a contract laboratory) to provide the cell processing services necessary for clinical production of BRTX-100 for our disc clinical trial. To date, we have not produced any products at our laboratory. We expect that we would need to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities to meet potential commercial demand for BRTX-100 and any other of our product candidates, if approved, as well as any of our other product candidates that might attain regulatory approval. Such expansion would require additional regulatory approvals. Even if we increase our manufacturing capabilities, it is possible that we may still lack sufficient capacity to meet demand. Ultimately, if we are unable to supply our products to meet commercial demand, whether because of processing constraints or other disruptions, delays or difficulties that we experience, sales of the products and their long-term commercial prospects could be significantly damaged.\nTable 122: <table><tr><td>43 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe do not presently have a third-party manufacturer for BRTX-100 or any of our other product candidates. If our facilities at which these product candidates would be manufactured or our equipment were significantly damaged or destroyed, or if there were other disruptions, delays or difficulties affecting manufacturing capacity, our planned and future clinical studies and commercial production for these product candidates would likely be significantly disrupted and delayed. It would be both time consuming and expensive to replace this capacity with third parties, particularly since any new facility would need to comply with the regulatory requirements.\nUltimately, if we are unable to supply our cell therapy product candidates to meet commercial demand (assuming commercial approval is obtained), whether because of processing constraints or other disruptions, delays or difficulties that we experience, our production costs could dramatically increase and sales of the product and its long-term commercial prospects could be significantly damaged.\nThe commercial potential and profitability of our products are unknown and subject to significant risk and uncertainty.\nEven if we successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for our cell therapy product candidates, the market may not understand or accept the products, which could adversely affect both the timing and level of future sales. Ultimately, the degree of market acceptance of our product candidates (or any of our future product candidates) will depend on a number of factors, including:\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the clinical effectiveness, safety and convenience of the product particularly in relation to alternative treatments; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our ability to distinguish our products (which involve adult cells) from any ethical and political controversies associated with stem cell products derived from human embryonic or fetal tissue; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the cost of the product, the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors and our ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEven if we are successful in achieving sales of our product candidates, it is not clear to what extent, if any, the products will be profitable. The costs of goods associated with production of cell therapy products are significant. In addition, some changes in manufacturing processes or procedures generally require FDA or foreign regulatory authority review and approval prior to implementation. We may need to conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials to support approval of any such changes. Furthermore, this review process could be costly and time-consuming and could delay or prevent the commercialization of product candidates.\nWe may have difficulties in sourcing brown adipose (fat) tissue.\nWe use brown adipose (fat) tissue to identify and characterize brown adipose derived stem cells for use in our pre-clinical ThermoStem Program. There is no certainty that we will be able to continue to collect brown adipose samples through any relationships that we have, have had or may establish with potential sources of brown adipose tissue. The inability to procure brown fat tissue would have a material adverse effect upon our ability to advance our ThermoStem Program.\nWe are required to complete a certain milestone to maintain our exclusive license rights with regard to the disc/spine technology. The loss of such exclusive rights would have a material adverse effect upon us.\nPursuant to our license agreement with Regenerative Sciences, LLC, we must complete our Phase 2 clinical trial by a certain date (which we believe to be February 2022) in order to maintain our exclusive rights with regard to the disc/spine technology. It is not anticipated that we will achieve such milestone. Any loss of such exclusive rights would have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Business-Disc/Spine Program - License.\u201d\nTable 125: <table><tr><td>44 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf safety problems are encountered by us or others developing new stem cell-based therapies, our stem cell initiatives could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe use of stem cells for therapeutic indications is still in the very early stages of development. If an adverse event occurs during clinical trials related to one of our proposed products and/or services or those of others, the FDA and other regulatory authorities may halt clinical trials or require additional studies. The occurrence of any of these events would delay, and increase the cost of, our development efforts and may render the commercialization of our proposed products and/or services impractical or impossible.\nWe are vulnerable to competition and technological change, and also to physicians' inertia.\nWe will compete with many domestic and foreign companies in developing our technology and products, including biotechnology, medical device and pharmaceutical companies. Many current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing, and personnel resources. There is no assurance that our competitors will not succeed in developing alternative products and/or services that are more effective, easier to use, or more economical than those which we may develop, or that would render our products and/or services obsolete and non-competitive. In general, we may not be able to prevent others from developing and marketing competitive products and/or services similar to ours or which perform similar functions or which are marketed before ours.\nCompetitors may have greater experience in developing products, therapies or devices, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals, manufacturing and commercialization. It is possible that competitors may obtain patent protection, approval or clearance from the FDA or achieve commercialization earlier than we can, any of which could have a substantial negative effect on our business.\nWe will compete against cell-based therapies derived from alternate sources, such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord blood and potentially embryos. Doctors historically are slow to adopt new technologies like ours, whatever the merits, when older technologies continue to be supported by established providers. Overcoming such inertia often requires very significant marketing expenditures or definitive product performance and/or pricing superiority.\nWe expect that physicians' inertia and skepticism will also be a significant barrier as we attempt to gain market penetration with our future products and services. We may need to finance lengthy time-consuming clinical studies (so as to provide convincing evidence of the medical benefit) in order to overcome this inertia and skepticism.\nWe may form or seek collaborations or strategic alliances or enter into additional licensing arrangements in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances or licensing arrangements.\nWe may form or seek strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations, or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to our product candidates and any future product candidates that we may develop. Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute the shares of our existing stockholders, or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. To date, such efforts have not been successful.\nFurther, collaborations involving our product candidates, such as our collaborations with third-party research institutions, are subject to numerous risks, which may include the following:\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to a collaboration; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products, availability of funding, or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td>45 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial, stop a clinical trial, abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to their marketing and distribution; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>disputes may arise between us and a collaborator that cause the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>collaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our products that results from our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we would not have the exclusive right to commercialize such intellectual property. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result, if we enter into collaboration agreements and strategic partnerships or license our products or businesses, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture, which could delay our timelines or otherwise adversely affect our business. We also cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction. Any delays in entering into new collaborations or strategic partnership agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates in certain geographies for certain indications, which would harm our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have limited experience in the development and marketing of cell therapies and may be unsuccessful in our efforts to establish a profitable business.\nOur business plan has been focused historically on capturing a piece of the burgeoning field of cell therapy. We have limited experience in the areas of cell therapy product development and marketing, and in the related regulatory issues and processes. Although we have recruited a team that has experience with designing and conducting clinical trials and hired contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations and FDA consultants, as a company, we have limited experience in conducting clinical trials and no experience in conducting clinical trials through to regulatory approval of any product candidate. In part because of this lack of experience, we cannot be certain that planned clinical trials will begin or be completed on time, if at all. We cannot assure that we will successfully achieve our clinical development goals or fulfill our plans to capture a piece of the cell therapy market.\nOur cell therapy business is based on novel technologies that are inherently expensive, risky and may not be understood by or accepted in the marketplace, which could adversely affect our future value.\nThe clinical development, commercialization and marketing of cell and tissue-based therapies are at an early-stage, substantially research-oriented, and financially speculative. To date, very few companies have been successful in their efforts to develop and commercialize a cell therapy product. In general, cell-based or tissue-based products may be susceptible to various risks, including undesirable and unintended side effects, unintended immune system responses, inadequate therapeutic efficacy, or other characteristics that may prevent or limit their approval or commercial use. In addition, BRTX-100 is a cell-based candidate that is produced by using a patient's own stem cells derived from bone marrow. Regulatory approval of novel product candidates such as BRTX-100, which is manufactured using novel manufacturing processes, can be more complex and expensive and take longer than other, more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical products, due to the FDA's lack of experience with them. To our knowledge, the FDA has not yet approved a disc related stem cell therapy product. This lack of experience may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to conduct additional studies or clinical trials, which would increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these product candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. Furthermore, the number of people who may use cell or tissue-based therapies is difficult to forecast with accuracy. Our future success is dependent on the establishment of a large global market for cell- and tissue-based therapies and our ability to capture a share of this market with our product candidates.\nTable 131: <table><tr><td>46 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur cell therapy product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biologic products may face competition sooner than anticipated.\nThe enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 ( BPCIA\u201d) created an abbreviated regulatory pathway for the approval of products demonstrated to be biosimilar, or highly similar,\u201d to or interchangeable\u201d with an FDA-approved innovator (original) biologic product. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable\u201d based on its similarity to an existing reference product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product is approved under a biologics license application ( BLA\u201d). Although the FDA has approved several biosimilar products, complex provisions of the law are still being implemented by the FDA and interpreted by the federal courts. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning of the BPCIA are still subject to some uncertainty and FDA actions and court decisions concerning the law could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.\nWe believe that, if any of our product candidates are approved as a biological product under a BLA, it should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that the FDA could approve biosimilar applicants for other reference products that no longer have such exclusivity, thus potentially creating the opportunity for greater competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nThe FDA's regulation of regenerative medicine products remains unpredictable and we are not certain what impact this will have on the potential approval of our products.\nThe FDA's regulation of therapies derived from stem cell products and technologies is evolving and may continue to evolve. In December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (the Cures Act\u201d) was signed into law in the United States to advance access to medical innovations. Among other things, the Cures Act established a new FDA regenerative medicine advanced therapy ( RMAT\u201d) designation. This designation offers a variety of benefits to product candidates, including enhanced FDA support during clinical development, priority review on application filing, accelerated approval based on potential surrogate endpoints, and the potential use of patient registry data and other forms of real world evidence for post-approval confirmatory studies. There is no certainty that any of our product candidates will receive RMAT designation or any other type of expedited review program designation from the FDA. In any event, the receipt of an FDA RMAT designation or other expedited review program designation may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to products considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA.\nWe may be subject to significant product liability claims and litigation, including potential exposure from the use of our product candidates in human subjects, and our insurance may be inadequate to cover claims that may arise.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks inherent in the testing, processing and marketing of cell therapy products. Such liability claims may be expensive to defend and result in large judgments against us. We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our current and any future product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk with respect to any commercial sales of our products should they be approved. No product candidate has been widely used over an extended period of time, and therefore safety data is limited. Cell therapy companies derive the raw materials for manufacturing of product candidates from human cell sources, and therefore the manufacturing process and handling requirements are extensive, which increases the risk of quality failures and subsequent product liability claims.\nWe will need to maintain insurance coverage adequate to cover our clinical trials and increase that coverage before commercializing product candidates, if ever. At any time during our clinical trials or after commercialization, if that occurs, we may not be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or at all, or if claims against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our financial position could be significantly impaired.\nTable 133: <table><tr><td>47 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation that may arise, such litigation could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, result in decreased demand for our products and injure our reputation.\nWe seek to maintain errors and omissions, directors and officers, workers' compensation and other insurance at levels we believe to be appropriate to our business activities. If, however, we were subject to a claim in excess of this coverage or to a claim not covered by our insurance and the claim succeeded, we would be required to pay the claim from our own limited resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business. Additionally, liability or alleged liability could harm our business by diverting the attention and resources of our management and damaging our reputation.\nOur internal computer systems, or those that are expected to be used by our clinical investigators, clinical research organizations or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of development programs for our product candidates.\nWe rely on information technology systems to keep financial records, maintain laboratory and corporate records, communicate with staff and external parties and operate other critical functions. Any significant degradation or failure of these computer systems could cause us to inaccurately calculate or lose data. Despite the implementation of security measures, these internal computer systems and those used by our clinical investigators, clinical research organizations, and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. The techniques that could be used by criminal elements or foreign governments to attack these computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. While we have not experienced any such system failure, theft of information, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our clinical development activities. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from historical or future clinical trials could result in delays in regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption, theft of information, or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the clinical development and the future development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nTo operate and sell in international markets carries great risk.\nWe intend to market our products and services both domestically and in foreign markets. A number of risks are inherent in international transactions. In order for us to market our products and services in non-U.S. jurisdictions, we need to obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals or clearances in these countries and must comply with the country specific regulations regarding safety, manufacturing processes and quality. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearances to market, may differ from the FDA regulatory scheme. International operations and sales also may be limited or disrupted by political instability, price controls, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs. Additionally, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect demand for our services and products by increasing the price of our products and services in the currency of the countries in which the products and services are offered.\nThere can be no assurance that we will obtain regulatory approvals or clearances in all of the countries where we intend to market our products and services, or that we will not incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or clearances, or that we will be able to successfully commercialize our products and services in various foreign markets. Delays in receipt of approvals or clearances to market our products and services in foreign countries, failure to receive such approvals or clearances or the future loss of previously received approvals or clearances could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to obtain reimbursement for our products and services from private and governmental insurers could negatively impact demand for our products and services.\nMarket acceptance and sales of our product candidates may depend on coverage and reimbursement policies and health care reform measures. Decisions about formulary coverage as well as levels at which government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, reimburse patients for the price they pay for our product candidates, as well as levels at which these payors pay directly for our product candidates, where applicable, could affect whether we are able to successfully commercialize these products. We cannot guarantee that reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates. We also cannot guarantee that coverage or reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our product candidates.\nTable 135: <table><tr><td>48 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf coverage and reimbursement are not available or are available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA\u201d) and other health reform proposals include measures that would limit or prohibit payments for certain medical treatments or subject the pricing of drugs to government control. In addition, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the European Union (the EU\u201d), the pricing of drugs and biologics is subject to government control. If our products are or become subject to government regulation that limits or prohibits payment for our products, or that subjects the price of our products to government control, we may not be able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.\nIn addition, third-party payors are increasingly limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs and biologics. They may also impose strict prior authorization requirements and/or refuse to provide any coverage of uses of approved products for medical indications other than those for which the FDA has granted market approvals. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payors will reimburse patients for their use of newly-approved drugs and biologics. If we are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement for our product candidates, our ability to successfully market and sell our product candidates will be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary rights.\nOur commercial success will depend in large part upon our ability to protect our proprietary rights. There is no assurance, for example, that any additional patents will be issued based on our or our licensor's pending applications or, if issued, that such patents will not become the subject of a re-examination, will provide us with competitive advantages, will not be challenged by any third parties, or that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products and services incorporating our technology. Furthermore, there can be no guarantee that others will not independently develop similar products and services, duplicate any of our products and services, or design around any patents we obtain.\nOur commercial success will also depend upon our ability to avoid infringing patents issued to others. If we were judicially determined to be infringing on any third-party patent, we could be required to pay damages, alter our products, services or processes, obtain licenses, or cease certain activities. If we are required in the future to obtain any licenses from third parties for some of our products and/or services, there can be no guarantee that we would be able to do so on commercially favorable terms, if at all. United States and foreign patent applications are not immediately made public, so we might be surprised by the grant to someone else of a patent on a technology we are actively using. Although we conducted a freedom to operate ( FTO\u201d) search on the licensed technology associated with our Disc/Spine Program, modifications made, and/or further developments that may be made, to that technology may not be covered by the initial FTO. No FTO has been undertaken with respect to our ThermoStem brown fat initiative.\nLitigation, which would result in substantial costs to us and the diversion of effort on our part, may be necessary to enforce or confirm the ownership of any patents issued or licensed to us, or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. If our competitors claim technology also claimed by us and prepare and file patent applications in the United States, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the Patent Office\u201d) or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of effort, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Any such litigation or interference proceeding, regardless of outcome, could be expensive and time-consuming.\nSuccessful challenges to our patents through oppositions, re-examination proceedings or interference proceedings could result in a loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we are unsuccessful in actions we bring against the patents of other parties, and it is determined that we infringe upon the patents of third parties, we may be subject to litigation, or otherwise prevented from commercializing potential products and/or services in the relevant jurisdiction, or may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or develop or obtain alternative technologies, any of which could harm our business. Furthermore, if such challenges to our patent rights are not resolved in our favor, we could be delayed or prevented from entering into new collaborations or from commercializing certain products and/or services, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTable 137: <table><tr><td>49 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation. In addition, during the course of litigation there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. Some of our intended future cell-related therapeutic products and/or services may fit into this category. We also rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with our partners, employees, advisors, vendors, and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. There can be no guarantee that these agreements will not be breached, or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.\nFailure to obtain or maintain patent protection, failure to protect trade secrets, third-party claims against our patents, trade secrets, or proprietary rights or our involvement in disputes over our patents, trade secrets, or proprietary rights, including involvement in litigation, could divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business and have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property in countries outside of the United States.\nIntellectual property law outside the United States is uncertain and, in many countries, is currently undergoing review and revisions. The laws of some countries do not protect our patent and other intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States laws. Third parties may attempt to oppose the issuance of patents to us in foreign countries by initiating opposition proceedings. Opposition proceedings against any of our patent filings in a foreign country could have an adverse effect on our corresponding patents that are issued or pending in the United States. It may be necessary or useful for us to participate in proceedings to determine the validity of our patents or our competitors' patents that have been issued in countries other than the United States. This could result in substantial costs, divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges to United States patent law may have a material adverse effect on our intellectual property rights.\nThe Leahy-Smith America Invents Act ( AIA\u201d), which was signed into law in 2011, significantly changes United States patent law. It may take some time to establish what the law means, since it is just being interpreted by the lower courts, Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal, and the Supreme Court. The effects of these decisions are still not known. The first major change is that AIA switches the United States patent system from a first to invent\u201d system to a first to file\u201d system. Now that the first to file system is in effect, there is a risk that another company may independently develop identical or similar patents at approximately the same time, and be awarded the patents instead of us. Further, for the second major change, AIA abolished interference proceedings, and establishes derivation proceedings to replace interference proceedings in all cases in which the time period for instituting an interference proceeding has not lapsed where an inventor named in an earlier application derived the claimed invention from a named inventor. Now that the derivation proceedings are in effect, there is a risk that the inventorship of any pending patent application can be challenged for reasons of derivation. The third major change is that AIA established post-grant opposition proceedings that will apply only to patent applications filed after first to file\u201d became effective. Post-grant opposition will enable a person who is not the patent owner to initiate proceedings in the Patent Office within nine months after the grant of a patent that can result in cancellation of a patent as invalid. In addition to AIA, recent court decisions have created uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain and maintain patents. Therefore there is a risk that any of our patents once granted may be subject to post-grant opposition, which will increase uncertainty on the validity of any newly granted patent or may ultimately result in cancellation of the patent.\nIn addition, the Supreme Court has recently taken more limiting positions as to what constitutes patentable subject matter. As a result, many patents covering what were previously patentable inventions are now determined to cover inventions which are deemed non-statutory subject matter and are now invalid. As a result of this and subsequent opinions by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the Patent Office is now applying more stringent limitations to claims in patent applications and is refusing to grant patents in areas of technology where patents were previously deemed available. Therefore there is a risk that we will be unable to acquire patents to cover our products and if such patents are granted they may subsequently be found to be invalid.\nTable 139: <table><tr><td>50 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn certain countries, patent holders may be required to grant compulsory licenses, which would likely have a significant and detrimental effect on any future revenues in such country.\nMany countries, including some countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, most countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may be limited to monetary relief and may be unable to enjoin infringement, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. Compulsory licensing of life-saving products is also becoming increasingly common in developing countries, either through direct legislation or international initiatives. Such compulsory licenses could be extended to our product candidates, which may limit our potential revenue opportunities, including with respect to any future revenues that may result from our product candidates.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, our products will remain subject to regulatory oversight.\nOur product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information. Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates also may be subject to a REMS or the specific obligations imposed as a condition for marketing authorization by equivalent authorities in a foreign jurisdiction, limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the quality, safety and efficacy of the product. For example, in the United States, the holder of an approved new drug application ( NDA\u201d) or BLA is obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA or BLA. The holder of an approved NDA or BLA also must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ( FDCA\u201d) and implementing regulations and are subject to FDA oversight and post-marketing reporting obligations, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws.\nIn addition, product manufacturers and their facilities may be subject to payment of application and program fees and are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP requirements and adherence to commitments made in the NDA, BLA or foreign marketing application. If we or a regulatory authority discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or if a regulatory authority disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of our product, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions relative to that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements for any product candidate following approval, a regulatory authority may:\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>issue a warning or untitled letter asserting that we are in violation of the law; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>seek an injunction or impose administrative, civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>suspend or withdraw regulatory approval; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>suspend any ongoing clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>refuse to approve a pending BLA or comparable foreign marketing application (or any supplements thereto) submitted by us or our strategic partners; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>restrict the marketing or manufacturing of the product; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>seize or detain the product or otherwise demand or require the withdrawal or recall of the product from the market; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>refuse to permit the import or export of products; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>request and publicize a voluntary recall of the product; or </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td>51 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAny government enforcement action or investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nIn the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drugs and biologic products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local authorities, including the FDA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d), other divisions the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS\u201d) (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice offices of the United States Attorney, the Federal Trade Commission and state and local governments. Our operations are directly, or indirectly through our prescribers, customers and purchasers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute ( AKS\u201d), the federal civil and criminal False Claims Act ( FCA\u201d), the Physician Payments Sunshine Act and regulations and equivalent provisions in other countries. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy laws by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.\nState and federal regulatory and enforcement agencies continue actively to investigate violations of health care laws and regulations, and the United States Congress continues to strengthen the arsenal of enforcement tools. Most recently, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the criminal and civil penalties that can be imposed for violating certain federal health care laws, including the AKS. Enforcement agencies also continue to pursue novel theories of liability under these laws. Government agencies have recently increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement activity with respect to programs supported or sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, including reimbursement and co-pay support, funding of independent charitable foundations and other programs that offer benefits for patients. Several investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other government regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business.\nFurther, in the event we determine to operate in foreign jurisdictions, including conducting clinical trials, we will need to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the FCPA\u201d). The FCPA prohibits a corporation, including its subsidiaries, third-party contractors, distributors, consultants and employees, from corruptly making or offering to make payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or enhancing business. Under the law, foreign officials\u201d include employees of health systems operated by government entities. The FCPA also establishes specific record-keeping and internal accounting controls. Violations of the FCPA can result in the imposition of civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Failure to comply with the FCPA will adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to the FCPA, we will also need to comply with the foreign government laws and regulations of each individual country in which any therapy centers that we may establish are located and products are to be distributed and sold. These regulations vary in complexity and can be as stringent, and on occasion even more stringent, than FDA regulations in the United States. Due to the fact that there are new and emerging stem cell and cell therapy regulations that have recently been drafted and/or implemented in various countries around the world, the application and subsequent implementation of these new and emerging regulations have little to no precedence. Therefore, the level of complexity and stringency is not always precisely understood today for each country, creating greater uncertainty for the international regulatory process. Furthermore, there can be no guarantee that laws and regulations will not be implemented, amended and/or reinterpreted in a way that will negatively affect our business. Likewise, there can be no assurance that we will be able, or will have the resources, to maintain compliance with all such healthcare laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such healthcare laws and regulations, as well as the costs associated with such compliance or with enforcement of such healthcare laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our operations or may require restructuring of our operations or impair our ability to operate profitably.\nTable 144: <table><tr><td>52 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur current and future employees, consultants and advisors and our future principal investigators, medical institutions and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our current and future employees, consultants and advisors and our future principal investigators, medical institutions and commercial partners, including contract laboratories, and CROs. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or the regulations applicable in other jurisdictions, provide accurate information to the FDA and other regulatory authorities, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us.\nWe currently do not and in the future may not independently conduct all aspects of our product candidate research and preclinical and clinical testing and product candidate manufacturing. If we rely on third parties, including CROs, medical institutions, and contract laboratories to monitor and manage data for our ongoing preclinical and clinical programs, we will still maintain responsibility for ensuring their activities are conducted in accordance with the applicable study protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards. We and our third-party vendors will be required to comply with current cGMP, GCP, and Good Laboratory Practice ( GLP\u201d) requirements, which are a collection of laws and regulations enforced by the FDA, the EU and comparable foreign authorities for all of our product candidates in clinical development.\nIn addition, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Such misconduct also could involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or interactions with the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation.\nThe precautions we take to detect and prevent employee and third-party misconduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nThe failure to receive regulatory approvals for our cell therapy product candidates would likely have a material and adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nTo date, we have not received regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates in any jurisdiction. If we seek approval of any of our cell therapy product candidates, we will be required to submit to the FDA and potentially other regulatory authorities extensive pre-clinical and clinical data supporting its safety and efficacy, as well as information about the manufacturing process and to undergo inspection of our manufacturing facility or other contract manufacturing facilities, among other things. The process of obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals is expensive, generally takes many years and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, particularly with complex and/or novel product candidates such as our cell-based product candidates. Changes in regulatory approval requirements or policies may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application or may make it easier for our competitors to gain regulatory approval to enter the marketplace. Ultimately, the FDA and other regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our product candidate data are insufficient for approval without the submission of additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying agency interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate. Any difficulties or failures that we encounter in securing regulatory approval for our product candidates would likely have a substantial adverse impact on our ability to generate product sales, and could make any search for a collaborative partner more difficult. Similarly, any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nTable 146: <table><tr><td>53 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf we are unable to conduct clinical studies in accordance with regulations and accepted standards, we may be delayed in receiving, or may never receive, regulatory approvals of our product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.\nTo obtain marketing approvals for our product candidates in the United States and abroad, we must, among other requirements, complete adequate and well-controlled clinical trials sufficient to demonstrate to the FDA and other regulatory bodies that the product candidate is safe and effective for each indication for which approval is sought. If the FDA finds that patients enrolled in the trial are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury, due to, among other things, occurrence of a serious adverse event in an ongoing clinical trial, the FDA can place one or more of our clinical trials on hold. If safety concerns develop, we may, or the FDA or an institutional review board may require us to, stop the affected trials before completion.\nThe completion of our clinical trials also may be delayed or terminated for a number of other reasons, including if:\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>third-party clinical investigators do not perform the clinical trials on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices required by the FDA and other regulatory requirements, or other third parties do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>inspections of clinical trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities reveal violations that require us to undertake corrective action, suspend or terminate one or more sites, or prohibit use of some or all of the data in support of marketing applications; or </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the FDA or one or more institutional review boards suspends or terminates the trial at an investigational site, or precludes enrollment of additional subjects. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur development costs will increase if there are material delays in our clinical trials, or if we are required to modify, suspend, terminate or repeat a clinical trial. If we are unable to conduct our clinical trials properly, we may never receive regulatory approval to market our product candidates.\nHealth care companies have been the subjects of federal and state investigations, and we could become subject to investigations in the future.\nBoth federal and state government agencies have heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. There are numerous ongoing investigations of health care companies, as well as their executives and managers. In addition, amendments to the federal FCA, including under healthcare reform legislation, have made it easier for private parties to bring qui tam\u201d (or whistleblower) lawsuits against companies under which the whistleblower may be entitled to receive a percentage of any money paid to the government. The FCA provides, in part, that an action can be brought against any person or entity that has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. The government has taken the position that claims presented in violation of the federal AKS, Stark Law or other healthcare-related laws, including laws enforced by the FDA, may be considered a violation of the FCA. Penalties include substantial fines for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person or entity and/or exclusion from the Medicare program. In addition, a majority of states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions.\nWe are not aware of any government investigations involving any of our facilities or management. While we believe that we are in compliance with applicable governmental healthcare laws and regulations, any future investigations of our business or executives could cause us to incur substantial costs, and result in significant liabilities or penalties, as well as damage to our reputation.\nTable 149: <table><tr><td>54 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIt is uncertain to what extent the government, private health insurers and third-party payors will approve coverage or provide reimbursement for the therapies and products to which our services relate. Availability for such reimbursement may be further limited by reductions in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare program funding in the United States.\nTo the extent that health care providers cannot obtain coverage or reimbursement for our products and therapies, they may elect not to provide such products and therapies to their patients and, thus, may not need our services. Further, as cost containment pressures are increasing in the health care industry, government and private payors may adopt strategies designed to limit the amount of reimbursement paid to health care providers.\nSimilarly, the trend toward managed health care and bundled pricing for health care services in the United States, could significantly influence the purchase of healthcare products and services, resulting in lower prices and reduced demand for our therapeutic products under development.\nWe may directly or indirectly receive revenues from federal health care programs, such as Medicare. Federal health care programs are subject to changes in coverage and reimbursement rules and procedures, including retroactive rate adjustments. These contingencies could materially decrease the range of services covered by such programs or the reimbursement rates paid directly or indirectly for our products and services. To the extent that any health care reform favors the reimbursement of other therapies over our therapeutic products under development, such reform could affect our ability to sell our services, which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nThe limitation on reimbursement available from private and government payors may reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Additional legislation or regulation relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future which could adversely affect the revenues generated from the sale of our products and services.\nFurthermore, there has been a trend in recent years towards reductions in overall funding for Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. There has also been an increase in the number of people who are not eligible for or enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. The reduced funding of governmental programs could have a negative impact on the demand for our services to the extent it relates to products and services which are reimbursed by government and private payors.\nUnintended consequences of healthcare reform in the United States may adversely affect our business.\nThe healthcare industry is undergoing fundamental changes resulting from political, economic and regulatory influences. In the United States, the PPACA was signed into law in 2010 under the Obama administration. By implementing comprehensive reforms, the law seeks to, among other things, increase access to healthcare for the uninsured and control the escalation of healthcare expenditures within the economy. While we do not believe this law will have a direct impact on our business, the law requires the adoption of various implementing regulations, which may have unintended consequences or indirectly impact our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In the past two years, Congress has considered additional reductions in Medicare reimbursement for drugs and devices as part of legislation to reduce the budget deficit. Similar legislation could be enacted in the future. The Medicare regulations and interpretive determinations that determine how drugs, devices and services are covered and reimbursed also are subject to change. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could impact our business.\nHealthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and decreased reimbursement. Under the Trump administration, Congress passed certain legislation to alter the PPACA. In addition, Congress and select states have proposed legislation to alter and/or repeal the PPACA and/or transform certain aspects of existing federal and state health programs. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates. It is difficult to predict how enforcement initiatives under the PPACA and/or additional legislation or regulation enacted in the future may impact our business. If the PPACA and/or additional legislation or regulation enacted in the future cause such unintended consequences or indirect impact, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTable 151: <table><tr><td>55 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCompetitor companies or hospitals in the EU may be able to take advantage of EU rules permitting sales of unlicensed medicines for individual patients to sell competing products without a marketing authorization.\nThe EU medicines rules allow individual member states to permit the supply of a medicinal product without a marketing authorization to fulfill special needs, where the product is supplied in response to a bona fide unsolicited order, formulated in accordance with the specifications of a healthcare professional and for use by an individual patient under his direct personal responsibility. This may, in certain countries, also apply to products manufactured in a country outside the EU and imported to treat specific patients or small groups of patients. In addition, advanced therapy medicinal products do not need a marketing authorization if they are prepared on a non-routine basis and are used within the same EU member state in a hospital in accordance with a medical prescription for an individual patient.\nThese exemptions could allow our competitors to make sales in the EU without having obtained a marketing authorization and without undergoing the expense of clinical trials, especially if those competitors have cell processing facilities in the relevant EU member state. Similarly, certain hospitals may be able to compete with us on the basis of these rules.\nRisks Related to and Our Common Stock\nWe pay no dividends.\nWe have never paid cash dividends in the past, and currently do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThere is at present only a limited market for our common stock, and there is no assurance that an active trading market for our securities will develop.\nThe market for our common stock is limited. No assurance can be given that an active market for our shares will develop or, if developed, will be sustained. In addition, although there have been market makers in our common stock, we cannot assure that these market makers will continue to make a market in our securities or that other factors outside of our control will not cause them to stop market making in our securities. Making a market in securities involves maintaining bid and ask quotations and being able to effect transactions in reasonable quantities at those quoted prices, subject to various securities laws and other regulatory requirements. Furthermore, the development and maintenance of a public trading market depends upon the existence of willing buyers and sellers, the presence of which is not within our control or that of any market maker. Market makers are not required to maintain a continuous two-sided market, are required to honor firm quotations for only a limited number of securities, and are free to withdraw firm quotations at any time. Even with a market maker, factors such as our past losses from operations and the small size of our company mean that there can be no assurance of an active and liquid market for our securities developing in the foreseeable future. Even if a market develops, we cannot assure that a market will continue, or that stockholders will be able to resell their securities at any price.\nStockholders who hold unregistered shares of our common stock are subject to resale restrictions pursuant to Rule 144 due to our former status as a shell company.\u201d\nWe previously were a shell company\u201d pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act ( Rule 144\u201d), and, as such, sales of our securities pursuant to Rule 144 cannot be made unless, among other things, we continue to remain subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and we file all of our required periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Because our unregistered securities cannot be sold pursuant to Rule 144 unless we continue to meet such requirements, any unregistered securities we sell in the future or issue to consultants or employees, in consideration for services rendered or for any other purpose, will have no liquidity unless we continue to comply with such requirements. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to obtain financing to fund our operations and pay our consultants and employees with our securities instead of cash.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, increased costs as a result of being an SEC reporting company.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as a variety of related rules implemented by the SEC, have required changes in corporate governance practices and generally increased the disclosure requirements of public companies. As a reporting company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses in connection with our public disclosure and other obligations. Based upon SEC regulations currently in effect, we are required to establish, evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. We believe that compliance with the myriad of rules and regulations applicable to reporting companies and related compliance issues will continue to require a significant amount of time and attention from our management.\nTable 153: <table><tr><td>56 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur stock prices may fluctuate significantly and be highly volatile and this may make it difficult for a stockholder to resell our securities at the volume, prices and times the stockholder finds attractive.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations and be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for a stockholder to resell our securities at the volume, prices and times the stockholder finds attractive. There are many factors that will impact our stock price and trading volume, including, but not limited to, the factors listed above under Risks Related to Our Business Generally,\u201d Risks Related to Our Cell Therapy Product Development Efforts,\u201d Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property,\u201d Risks Related to Government Regulation\u201d and Risks Related to Our Common Stock\u201d.\nStock markets, in general, experience significant price and volume volatility, and the market price of our securities may continue to be subject to such market fluctuations that may be unrelated to our operating performance and prospects. Increased market volatility and fluctuations could result in a substantial decline in the market price of our securities.\nThere may be significant future issuances or resales of our common stock which may materially and adversely dilute stockholders' ownership interest and affect the market price of our securities.\nWe have authorization to issue up to 300,000,000,000 shares of common stock of which, as of March 17, 2021, 3,016,743,991 shares are issued and outstanding. We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock in the future, including securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, we issued warrants for the purchase of an aggregate of 15,226,203,720 shares of our common stock. In addition, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, we issued convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $9,642,418. Such notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at prices related to the market price of our common stock at the time of conversion. Our issuance of additional shares of common stock in the future will dilute the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders.\nPursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, an aggregate of 1,049,726,797 shares of common stock were issued to holders of unsecured claims. Such shares are freely tradeable in the public market, except for shares held by affiliates.\nWe have effective registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act registering an aggregate of 19,955,000 shares of our common stock issuable under our 2010 Equity Participation Plan (the Plan\u201d). As of March 17, 2021, options to purchase 4,879,617 shares of our common stock were outstanding under the Plan. In addition, as of such date, 45,000 shares of common stock were issued as stock grants pursuant to the Plan. The Plan terminated on November 17, 2020 and accordingly no further grants may be made under the Plan. The shares issuable pursuant to the registration statements on Form S-8 will be freely tradable in the public market, except for shares held by affiliates.\nThe sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock, whether directly by us in future offerings or by our existing stockholders in the secondary market, the perception that such issuances or resales could occur or the availability for future issuances or resale of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock could materially and adversely affect the market price of our securities and our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities on attractive terms or at all.\nIn addition, our Board of Directors is authorized to designate and issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval, and we may issue other equity and equity-related securities that are senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, to support operations and growth, and to comply with any future changes in regulatory standards.\nTable 155: <table><tr><td>57 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnti-takeover provisions and the regulations to which we may be subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to our securityholders.\nWe are incorporated in Delaware. Anti-takeover provisions in Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their securities. Our certificate of incorporation provides that our Board of Directors may issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, without stockholder approval and with such terms, preferences, rights and privileges as the Board of Directors may deem appropriate. These provisions and other factors may hinder or prevent a change in control, even if the change in control would be perceived as beneficial to, or sought by, our other stockholders.\nWe have not filed all periodic reports required to be filed with the SEC; we believe that such failure is making our common stock less difficult to sell.\nWe have not filed our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 or September 30, 2020. We believe that such lack of current public information is making our common stock more difficult to sell.\nOur common stock is classified as a penny stock;\u201d the restrictions of the penny stock regulations of the SEC may result in less liquidity for our common stock.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which define a penny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as therein defined) of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock by a retail customer, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about commissions payable to both the broker/dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Our common stock is classified as a penny stock. As a result of the penny stock restrictions, brokers or potential investors may be reluctant to trade in our securities, which may result in less liquidity for our securities.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nShares of our common stock that we have issued or are issuable upon the exercise of warrants or upon the conversion of convertible debt may be covered by registration statements which permit the public sale of stock. Other holders of shares of common stock that we have issued, including shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants and the conversion of convertible debt, may be entitled to dispose of their shares subject to the requirements of Rule 144 or other applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, the shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the conversion of convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $3,644,279 are subject to certain lock-up restrictions over the 180 day period following the November 16, 2020 effective date of the Plan of Reorganization. As those lock-up restrictions expire during said 180 day period, the shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the conversion of such notes will become eligible for resale in the open market (subject to Rule 144 volume limitations applicable to affiliates), resulting in more shares eligible for sale and potentially causing sales in the market to increase and our stock price to decline. In addition, effective February 17, 2021, certain lock-up restrictions imposed by the Plan of Reorganization with regard to the resale of the 1,049,726,797 shares of common stock issued to holders of unsecured claims expired. The unrestricted eligibility of such shares for resale in the open market (subject to Rule 144 volume limitations applicable to affiliates) could also have a negative effect upon our stock price. Additional sales of a substantial number of our shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our stock.\nTable 157: <table><tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7 of this Annual Report ( Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition - Risks Related to Our Cell Therapy Product Development Efforts; and - Risks Related to Government Regulation.\u201d). The FDA review and approval process can be lengthy, expensive and uncertain and there is no guarantee of ultimate approval or clearance.\nLaboratory\nWe have established a laboratory in Melville, New York for research purposes and have built a cleanroom within the laboratory for the possible production of cell-based product candidates, such as BRTX-100, for use in a clinical trial, for third party cell products or general research purposes.\nAs operations grow, our plans include the expansion of our laboratory to perform cellular characterization and culturing, protocol and stem cell-related IP development, translational research and therapeutic outcome analysis. As we develop our business and our stem cell product candidates and obtain regulatory approval, we will seek to establish ourselves as a key provider of adult stem cells for therapies and expand to provide cells in other market areas for stem cell therapy. We may also use outside laboratories specializing in cell therapy services and manufacturing of cell products.\n 15 \n \nTechnology; Research and Development\nWe intend to utilize our laboratory or a third party laboratory in connection with cellular research activities. We also intend to obtain cellular-based therapeutic technology licenses and increase our IP portfolio. We intend to seek to develop potential stem cell delivery systems or devices. The goal of these specialized delivery systems or devices is to deliver cells into specific areas of the body, control the rate, amount and types of cells used in a treatment, and populate these areas of the body with sufficient stem cells so that there is a successful therapeutic result.\nWe also intend to perform research to develop certain stem cell optimization compounds, media designed to enhance cellular growth and regeneration for the purpose of improving pre-treatment and post-treatment outcomes.\nIn our Disc/Spine Program, two patent applications have been filed with regard to technology that is the subject of the Regenerative License Agreement (see Disc/Spine Program-License\u201d above). Regenerative has been issued a patent from one of these applications with regard to its curved needle therapeutic delivery device. The other application remains pending. The patents that are the subject of the Regenerative License Agreement have been assigned to Regenexx, LLC which we have been advised is an affiliate of Regenerative.\nIn our ThermoStem Program, we have three pending United States patent applications and four United States patents within three patent families. With regards to the first patent family in the ThermoStem Program, patent applications have been filed in five foreign jurisdictions (of which four applications have been granted as foreign patents and one application, which is not listed in the table below, has lapsed). With regards to the second patent family in the ThermoStem Program, patent applications have been filed in four foreign jurisdictions (of which three applications have been granted as foreign patents). With regards to the third patent family in the ThermoStem Program, a U.S. application and PCT application have been filed.\nOur patent applications and those of Regenexx, LLC are currently in prosecution (i.e., we and Regenexx, LLC are seeking issued patents).

We intend to rely on a combination of patent, trade secret and know-how, copyright and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, licensing agreements, non-compete agreements and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Our success will also depend upon our ability to avoid infringing upon the proprietary rights of others, for if we are judicially determined to have infringed such rights, we may be required to pay damages, alter our services, products or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred $1,722,338 and $1,513,150, respectively, in research and development expenses.\nScientific Advisors\nWe have established a Scientific Advisory Board whose purpose is to provide advice and guidance in connection with scientific matters relating to our business. The Scientific Advisory Board has established a Disc Advisory Committee which focuses on matters relating to our Disc/Spine Program. Our Scientific Advisory Board members are Dr. Wayne Marasco (Chairman), Dr. Naiyer Imam, Dr. Wayne Olan, Dr. Joy Cavagnaro, Dr. Jason Lipetz, Dr. Harvinder Sandhu, Dr. Christopher Plastaras and Dr. Gerard A. Malanga. The Disc Advisory Committee members are Dr. Lipetz (Chairman), Dr. Olan, Dr. Sandhu, Dr. Plastaras and Dr. Malanga. See Item 10 ( Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance-Scientific Advisors\u201d) for a listing of the principal positions for Drs. Marasco, Imam, Olan, Cavagnaro, Lipetz, Sandhu, Plastaras and Malanga.\n 17 \n \nCompetition\nWe will compete with many pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies, as well as other private and public stem cell companies involved in the development and commercialization of cell-based medical technologies and therapies.\nRegenerative medicine is rapidly progressing, in large part through the development of cell-based therapies or devices designed to isolate cells from human tissues. Most efforts involve cell sources, such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, embryonic and fetal tissue, umbilical cord and peripheral blood and skeletal muscle.\nCompanies working in the area of regenerative medicine with regard to the disc and spine include, among others, Mesoblast, SpinalCyte, DiscGenics and Isto Biologics. Companies that are developing products and therapies to combat obesity and diabetes, including through the use of brown fat, include, among others, Novo Nordisk, Sanofi, Merck, Eli Lilly, Roche, Pfizer and Regeneron.\nMany of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing and personnel resources than we do. We cannot, with any accuracy, forecast when or if these companies are likely to bring their products and therapies to market in competition with those that we are pursuing.\nWith the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA\u201d), an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products was created. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and the proposed biosimilar product. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product, and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years following approval of the reference product, and it may not be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product is approved under a biologics license application ( BLA\u201d).\nWe believe that, if any of our product candidates are approved as a biological product under a BLA, it should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that the FDA could permit biosimilar applicants to reference approved biologics other than our therapeutic candidates, thus circumventing our exclusivity and potentially creating the opportunity for competition sooner than anticipated. Additionally, this period of regulatory exclusivity does not apply to companies pursuing regulatory approval via their own traditional BLA, rather than via the abbreviated pathway. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\n 18 \n \nSet forth below is a comparison of BRTX-100 to Mesoblast's adult stem cell biologic:\nWe believe that BRTX-100 has competitive advantages to Mesoblast's product for the following reasons:\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>The use of autologous cells results in low to no risk of rejection, greater safety profile (introduction of viral/genetic) and streamlined regulatory path </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Hypoxic culturing creates increased cell proliferation, greater plasticity, increased paracrine effect and increased cell survival after application </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Autologous platelet lysate provides growth factors that interact with the cells, allowing for better cell survival </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Low to no risk of safety concerns related to immunological and zoonotic (animal to human) transmission </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Strong runway for value creation with successful clinical results </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCustomers\nUpon regulatory approval, our cell product candidates are intended to be marketed to physicians, other health care professionals, hospitals, research institutions, pharmaceutical companies and the military. It is anticipated that physicians who are trained and skilled in performing spinal injections will be the physicians most likely to treat discs with injections of BRTX-100 upon regulatory approval. These physicians would include interventional physiatrists (physical medicine physicians), pain management anesthesiologists, interventional radiologists and neurosurgeons.\nGovernmental Regulation\nU.S. Government Regulation\nThe health care industry is highly regulated in the United States. The federal government, through various departments and agencies, state and local governments, and private third-party accreditation organizations, regulate and monitor the health care industry, associated products, and operations. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, manufacture, distribution and marketing of medical products, including drugs, biologics, and medical devices. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, post-approval monitoring, advertising, promotion, sampling and import and export of medical products. The following is a general overview of the laws and regulations pertaining to our business.\n 19 \n \nFDA Regulation of Stem Cell Treatment and Products\nThe FDA regulates the manufacture of human stem cell treatments and associated products under the authority of the Public Health Service Act ( PHSA\u201d) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( FDCA\u201d). Stem cells can be regulated under the FDA's Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products Regulations ( HCT/Ps\u201d) or may also be subject to the FDA's drug, biologic, or medical device regulations, each as discussed below.\nHuman Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products Regulation\nUnder Section 361 of the PHSA, the FDA issued specific regulations governing the use of HCT/Ps in humans. Pursuant to Part 1271 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR\u201d) (the HCT/P Regulations\u201d), the FDA established a unified registration and listing system for establishments that manufacture and process HCT/Ps. The regulations also include provisions pertaining to donor eligibility determinations; current good tissue practices covering all stages of production, including harvesting, processing, manufacture, storage, labeling, packaging, and distribution; and other procedures to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases.\nThe HCT/P Regulations define HCT/Ps as articles containing or consisting of human cells or tissues that are intended for implantation, transplantation, infusion or transfer into a human recipient.\u201d The HCT/P Regulations strictly constrain the types of products that may be regulated solely as HCT/P. Factors considered include the degree of manipulation, whether the product is intended for a homologous function, whether the product has been combined with noncellular or non-tissue components, and the product's effect or dependence on the body's metabolic function. In those instances where cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products have been only minimally manipulated, are intended strictly for homologous use, have not been combined with noncellular or nontissue substances, and do not depend on or have any effect on the body's metabolism, the manufacturer is only required to register with the FDA, submit a list of manufactured products, and adopt and implement procedures for the control of communicable diseases. If one or more of the above factors has been exceeded, the product would be regulated as a drug, biological product, or medical device rather than an HCT/P.\nBecause we are an enterprise in the early stages of operations and have not generated significant revenues from operations, it is difficult to anticipate the likely regulatory status of the array of products and services that we may offer. We believe that some of the adult autologous (self derived) stem cells that will be used in our cellular therapy products and services, including the brown adipose (fat) tissue that we intend to use in our ThermoStem Program, may be regulated by the FDA as HCT/Ps under the HCT/P Regulations. However, the FDA may disagree with this position or conclude that some or all of our stem cell therapy products or services do not meet the applicable definitions and exemptions to the regulation. In July, 2020, the FDA issued an updated guidance document entitled Regulatory Considerations for Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products: Minimal Manipulation and Homologous Use\u201d that provides additional guidance on how FDA interprets the HCT/P Regulations, particularly the definition of the terms minimally manipulated\u201d and homologous use.\u201d In the guidance, FDA stated it will exercise enforcement discretion until May 31, 2021 for products that do not comply with the HCT/P Regulations. After that date, manufacturers of products marketed as HCT/Ps that do not comply with the HCT/P Regulations will be subject to immediate FDA enforcement action. If we are not regulated solely under the HCT/P Regulations, we would need to expend significant resources to comply with the FDA's broad regulatory authority under the FDCA. Third party litigation concerning the autologous use of a stem cell mixture to treat musculoskeletal and spinal injuries has increased the likelihood that some of our products and services are likely to be regulated as a drug or biological product and require FDA approval. In past litigation, the FDA asserted that the defendants' use of cultured stem cells without FDA approval is in violation of the FDCA, claiming that the defendants' product is a drug. The defendants asserted that their procedure is part of the practice of medicine and therefore beyond the FDA's regulatory authority. The District Court ruled in favor of the FDA, and in February 2014 the Circuit Court affirmed the District Court's holding.\nIf regulated solely under the FDA's HCT/P statutory and regulatory provisions, once our laboratory in the United States becomes operational, it will need to satisfy the following requirements, among others, to process and store stem cells:\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>registration and listing of HCT/Ps with the FDA; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>donor eligibility determinations, including donor screening and donor testing requirements; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>current good tissue practices, specifically including requirements for the facilities, environmental controls, equipment, supplies and reagents, recovery of HCT/Ps from the patient, processing, storage, labeling and document controls, and distribution and shipment of the HCT/Ps to the laboratory, storage, or other facility; </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 20 \n \nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>tracking and traceability of HCT/Ps and equipment, supplies, and reagents used in the manufacture of HCT/Ps; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>adverse event reporting; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>FDA inspection; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>abiding by any FDA order of retention, recall, destruction, and cessation of manufacturing of HCT/Ps. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-reproductive HCT/Ps and non-peripheral blood stem/progenitor cells that are offered for import into the United States and regulated solely under Section 361 of the PHSA must also satisfy the requirements under 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1271.420. Section 1271.420 requires that the importer of record of HCT/Ps notify the FDA prior to, or at the time of, importation and provide sufficient information for the FDA to make an admissibility decision. In addition, the importer must hold the HCT/P intact and under conditions necessary to prevent transmission of communicable disease until an admissibility decision is made by the FDA.\nIf the FDA determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions including public warning letters, fines, consent decrees, orders of retention, recall or destruction of product, orders to cease manufacturing, and criminal prosecution. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect us.\nTo the extent that our cellular therapy activities are limited to developing products and services outside the United States, as described in detail below, the products and services would not be subject to FDA regulation, but will be subject to the applicable requirements of the foreign jurisdiction. We intend to comply with all applicable foreign governmental requirements.\nDrug and Biological Product Regulation\nAn HCT/P product that does not meet the criteria for being solely regulated under Section 361 of the PHSA will be regulated as a drug, device or biological product under the FDCA and/or Section 351 of the PHSA, and applicable FDA regulations. The FDA has broad regulatory authority over drugs and biologics marketed for sale in the United States. The FDA regulates the research, clinical testing, manufacturing, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, distribution, and production of drugs and biological products. The FDA also regulates the export of drugs and biological products manufactured in the United States to international markets in certain situations.\nThe process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:\n\u25cf completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practice ( GLP\u201d) or other applicable regulations;\n\u25cf submission of an IND, which allows clinical trials to begin unless the FDA objects within 30 days;\n\u25cf performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biologic for its intended use or uses conducted in accordance with FDA regulations and Good Clinical Practices ( GCP\u201d), which are international ethical and scientific quality standards meant to ensure that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected and that the integrity of the data is maintained;\n\u25cf registration of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products and certain clinical trial information;\n\u25cf preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application ( NDA\u201d), in the case of a drug or BLA in the case of a biologic;\n\u25cf review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;\n 21 \n \n\u25cf satisfactory completion of pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements and of selected clinical trial sites to assess compliance with GCP requirements; and\n\u25cf FDA approval of an NDA or BLA which must occur before a drug or biologic can be marketed or sold.\nApproval of an NDA requires a showing that the drug is safe and effective for its intended use and that the methods, facilities, and controls used for the manufacturing, processing, and packaging of the drug are adequate to preserve its identity, strength, quality, and purity. To obtain a BLA, a manufacturer must show that the proposed product is safe, pure, and potent and that the facility in which the product is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets established quality control standards.\nFor purposes of an NDA or BLA approval by the FDA, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following phases (which may overlap):\n\u25cf Phase 1: The investigational product is initially given to healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. These trials may also provide early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational product's pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.\n\u25cf Phase 2: These clinical trials are conducted in a limited number of human subjects in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the investigational product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and dosage levels. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials.\n\u25cf Phase 3: Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken after Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dosage range of the investigational product appears effective and has a tolerable safety profile. The Phase 2 clinical trials must also provide sufficient information for the design of Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety risks in an expanded human subject population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to further evaluate dosage, effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk profile of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling and approval by the FDA. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of an investigational drug or biologic.\nAll clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations, GCP requirements and their protocols in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. These government regulations may delay or prevent approval of product candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our business operations.\nThe FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials, referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, after a product is approved. Such trials may be made a condition to be satisfied for continuing drug approval. The results of Phase 4 clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. In addition, the FDA has authority to require sponsors to conduct post-marketing trials to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency.\n 22 \n \nUnder the Pediatric Research Equity Act ( PREA\u201d), certain NDAs and BLAs and certain supplements to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act ( FDASIA\u201d) amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan ( PSP\u201d) within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.\nChanges to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA, or an NDA or BLA supplement, before the change can be implemented. An NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA and BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs and BLAs.\nDrug and biological products must also comply with applicable requirements, including monitoring and recordkeeping activities, manufacturing requirements, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug's approved labeling, or off-label use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may, in their independent professional medical judgment, prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers typically may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling, or changes of the site of manufacture, are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, who may or may not grant approval or may include a lengthy review process.\nIn the event that the FDA does not regulate our product candidates in the United States solely under the HCT/P regulation, our products and activities could be regulated as drug or biological products under the FDCA. If regulated as drug or biological products, we will need to expend significant resources to ensure regulatory compliance. If an IND and NDA or BLA are required for any of our product candidates, there is no assurance as to whether or when we will receive FDA approval of the product candidate. The process of designing, conducting, compiling and submitting the non-clinical and clinical studies required for NDA or BLA approval is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable. The process can take many years, depending on the product and the FDA's requirements.\nIn addition, even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution or use, or post-marketing trial requirements. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, including safety labeling or imposition of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS\u201d), the requirement to conduct post-market studies or clinical trials or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval for our products, or obtaining approval but for significantly limited use, would harm our business. Further, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future United States or foreign governmental action.\nIf the FDA determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions from public warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals, seizure of our products, total or partial shutdown of our production, withdrawal of approvals, and criminal prosecutions. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect us.\n 23 \n \nFDA Expedited Review Programs\nThe FDA is authorized to expedite the review of NDAs and BLAs in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Drug and biologic products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied.\nIn addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track NDA or BLA before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review.\nAny product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may also be eligible for the following other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review:\n\u25cf Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review, and rolling review.\n\u25cf Priority review. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, it would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition compared to marketed products. The FDA aims to complete its review of priority review applications within six months as opposed to ten months for standard review.\n\u25cf Accelerated approval. Drug or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials.\nFast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.\nFurther, with the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act (the Cures Act\u201d) in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine advanced therapy ( RMAT\u201d) (which may include a cell therapy) that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a RMAT designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.\nMedical Device Regulation\nThe FDA also has broad authority over the regulation of medical devices marketed for sale in the United States. The FDA regulates the research, clinical testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, promotion, distribution, and production of medical devices. The FDA also regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the United States to international markets.\nUnder the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes, Class I, Class II, or Class III, depending upon the degree of risk associated with the medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are subject to the lowest degree of regulatory scrutiny because they are considered low risk devices and need only comply with the FDA's General Controls. The General Controls include compliance with the registration, listing, adverse event reporting requirements, and applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation as well as the general misbranding and adulteration prohibitions.\n 24 \n \nClass II devices are subject to the General Controls as well as certain Special Controls such as 510(k) premarket notification. Class III devices are subject to the highest degree of regulatory scrutiny and typically include life supporting and life sustaining devices and implants. They are subject to the General Controls and Special Controls that include a premarket approval application ( PMA\u201d). New\u201d devices are automatically regulated as Class III devices unless they are shown to be low risk, in which case they may be subject to de novo review to be moved to Class I or Class II. Clinical research of an investigational device is subject to the FDA's Investigational Device Exemption ( IDE\u201d) regulations. Nonsignificant risk devices are subject to abbreviated requirements that do not require a submission to the FDA but must have Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and comply with other requirements pertaining to informed consent, labeling, recordkeeping, reporting, and monitoring. Significant risk devices require the submission of an IDE application to the FDA and the FDA's approval of the IDE application.\nThe FDA premarket clearance and approval process can be lengthy, expensive and uncertain. It generally takes three to twelve months from submission to obtain 510(k) premarket clearance, although it may take longer. Approval of a PMA could take one to four years, or more, from the time the application is submitted and there is no guarantee of ultimate clearance or approval. Securing FDA clearances and approvals may require the submission of extensive clinical data and supporting information to the FDA. Additionally, the FDA actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing and promotion of devices for indications or uses that have not been cleared or approved by the FDA. In addition, modifications or enhancements of products that could affect the safety or effectiveness or effect a major change in the intended use of a device that was either cleared through the 510(k) process or approved through the PMA process may require further FDA review through new 510(k) or PMA submissions.\nIn the event we develop processes, products or services which qualify as medical devices subject to FDA regulation, we intend to comply with such regulations. If the FDA determines that our products are regulated as medical devices and we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions from public warning letters, application integrity proceedings, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals, seizure of our products, total or partial shutdown of our production, withdrawal of approvals, and criminal prosecutions. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect us.\nCurrent Good Manufacturing Practices and other FDA Regulations of Cellular Therapy Products\nProducts that fall outside of the HCT/P regulations and are regulated as drugs, biological products, or devices must comply with applicable cGMP regulations. These cGMPs and related quality standards are designed to ensure the products that are processed at a facility meet the FDA's applicable requirements for identity, strength, quality, sterility, purity, and safety. In the event that our domestic United States operations are subject to the FDA's drug, biological product, or device regulations, we intend to comply with the applicable cGMPs and quality regulations.\nIf the FDA determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions from public warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals, seizure of our products, total or partial shutdown of our production, withdrawal of approvals, and criminal prosecutions. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect us.\nPromotion of Foreign-Based Cellular Therapy Treatment- Medical Tourism\u201d\nWe may establish, or license technology to third parties in connection with their establishment of, adult stem cell therapy facilities outside the United States. We also intend to work with hospitals and physicians to make the stem cell-based therapies available for patients who travel outside the United States for treatment. Medical tourism\u201d is defined as the practice of traveling across international borders to obtain health care.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (the FTC\u201d) has the authority to regulate and police advertising of medical treatments, procedures, and regimens in the United States under the Federal Trade Commission Act, or the FTCA. The FTC has regulatory authority to prevent unfair and deceptive practices and false advertising. Specifically, the FTC requires advertisers and promoters to have a reasonable basis to substantiate and support claims. The FTC has many enforcement powers, one of which is the power to order disgorgement by promoters deemed in violation of the FTCA of any profits made from the promoted business and can order injunctions from further violative promotion. Advertising that we may utilize in connection with our medical tourism operations will be subject to FTC regulatory authority, and we intend to comply with such regulatory r\u00e9gime. Similar laws and requirements are likely to exist in other countries and we intend to comply with such requirements.\n 25 \n \nFederal Regulation of Clinical Laboratories\nCongress passed the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, in 1988, which provided the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d) authority over all laboratory testing, except research, that is performed on humans in the United States. The Division of Laboratory Services, within the Survey and Certification Group, under the Center for Medicaid and State Operations ( CMSO\u201d) has the responsibility for implementing the CLIA program.\nThe CLIA program is designed to establish quality laboratory testing by ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of patient test results. Under CLIA, a laboratory is a facility that does laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans and used to provide information for the diagnosis, prevention, treatment of disease, or impairment of, or assessment of health. Laboratories that handle stem cells and other biologic matter are, therefore, included under the CLIA program. Under the CLIA program, laboratories must be certified by the government, satisfy governmental quality and personnel standards, undergo proficiency testing, be subject to inspections, and pay fees. To the extent that our business activities require CLIA certification, we intend to obtain and maintain such certification. If we are subject to CLIA, the failure to comply with CLIA standards could result in suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory's CLIA certificate. In addition, fines or criminal penalties could also be levied. If any of these events were to occur, it could impact our business operations.\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-Protection of Patient Health Information\nWe may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA\u201d), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ( HITECH\u201d) and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on certain types of individuals and organizations. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other and from HIPAA in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Further, we may need to also comply with additional federal or state privacy laws and regulations that may apply to certain diagnoses, such as HIV/AIDS, to the extent that they apply to us.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS\u201d), through its Office for Civil Rights, investigates breach reports and determines whether administrative or technical modifications are required and whether civil or criminal sanctions should be imposed. Companies failing to comply with HIPAA and the implementing regulations may also be subject to civil money penalties or in the case of knowing violations, potential criminal penalties, including monetary fines, imprisonment, or both. In some cases, the State Attorneys General may seek enforcement and appropriate sanctions in federal court.\nOther Applicable U.S. Laws\nIn addition to the above-described regulation by United States federal and state government, the following are other federal and state laws and regulations that could directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate the business:\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>state and local licensure, registration, and regulation of the development of pharmaceuticals and biologics; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>state and local licensure of medical professionals; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>state statutes and regulations related to the corporate practice of medicine; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>laws and regulations administered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection related to the importation of biological material into the United States; </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 26 \n \nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>other laws and regulations administered by the FDA; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>other laws and regulations administered by HHS; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>state and local laws and regulations governing human subject research and clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the federal physician self-referral prohibition, also known as Stark Law, and any state equivalents to Stark Law; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the federal False Claims Act ( FCA\u201d); </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the federal Anti-Kickback Statute ( AKS\u201d) and any state equivalent statutes and regulations; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>federal and state coverage and reimbursement laws and regulations; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>state and local laws and regulations for the disposal and handling of medical waste and biohazardous material; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA\u201d) regulations and requirements; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the Intermediate Sanctions rules of the IRS providing for potential financial sanctions with respect to excess benefit transactions\u201d with tax-exempt organizations; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (in the event that our products are classified as drugs, biologics, devices or medical supplies and are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program); </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>state and other federal laws addressing the privacy of health information; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare professionals and other potential referral sources, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare professionals or marketing expenditures, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nViolation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations may result in penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment. Furthermore, efforts to ensure that business activities and business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can be costly for manufacturers of branded prescription products.\nForeign Government Regulation\nIn general, we will need to comply with the government regulations of each individual country in which our therapy centers are located and products are to be distributed and sold. These regulations vary in complexity and can be as stringent, and on occasion even more stringent, than FDA regulations in the United States. Due to the fact that there are new and emerging cell therapy regulations that have recently been drafted and/or implemented in various countries around the world, the application and subsequent implementation of these new and emerging regulations have little to no precedence. Therefore, the level of complexity and stringency is not always precisely understood for each country, creating greater uncertainty for the international regulatory process. Furthermore, government regulations can change with little to no notice and may result in up-regulation of our product(s), thereby creating a greater regulatory burden for our cell processing technology products. We have not yet thoroughly explored the applicable laws and regulations that we will need to comply with in foreign jurisdictions. It is possible that we may not be permitted to expand our business into one or more foreign jurisdictions.\n 27 \n \nWe do not have any definitive plans or arrangements with respect to the establishment by us of stem cell therapy clinics in any country. We intend to explore any such opportunities as they arise.\nOffices\nOur principal executive offices are located at 40 Marcus Drive, Suite One, Melville, New York, and our telephone number is (631) 760-8100.

For each of the following transactions, we relied upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d), as transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering or Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act as a security exchanged by an issuer with its existing security holders exclusively where no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting such exchange. For each such transaction, we did not use general solicitation or advertising to market the securities, the securities were offered to a limited number of persons, the investors had access to information regarding us (including information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019 and Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and press releases made by us), and we were available to answer questions by prospective investors.

We are currently pursuing our Disc/Spine Program with our initial investigational therapeutic product being called BRTX-100. We submitted an IND application to the FDA to obtain authorization to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial investigating the use of BRTX-100, our lead cell therapy candidate, in the treatment of chronic lower back pain arising from degenerative disc disease. We have received such authorization from the FDA. We intend to commence such clinical trial during the third quarter of 2021 (assuming the receipt of necessary funding). We have obtained a license to use technology for investigational adult stem cell treatment of disc and spine conditions, including protruding and bulging lumbar discs. The technology is an advanced stem cell injection procedure that may offer relief from lower back pain, buttock and leg pain, and numbness and tingling in the leg and foot. We are also developing our ThermoStem Program. This pre-clinical program involves the use of brown adipose (fat) in connection with the cell-based treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity as well as hypertension, other metabolic disorders and cardiac deficiencies. United States patents related to the ThermoStem Program were issued in September 2015, January 2019, and March 2020; a notice of allowance was issued in November 2020 for a United States patent application in the ThermoStem Program and is expected to issue in 2021; Australian patents related to the ThermoStem Program were issued in April 2017 and October 2019; a Japanese patent related to the ThermoStem Program was issued in December 2017; Israeli patents related to the ThermoStem Program were issued in October 2019 and May 2020; and European patents related to the ThermoStem Program were issued in April 2020 and January 2021.\nWe have licensed a patented curved needle device that is a needle system designed to deliver cells and/or other therapeutic products or materials to the spine and discs or other potential sites. We anticipate that FDA approval or clearance will be necessary for this device prior to commercialization. We do not intend to utilize this device in connection with our contemplated Phase 2 clinical trial with regard to BRTX-100.\nOur offices are located in Melville, New York where we have established a laboratory facility in order to increase our capabilities for the further development of possible cellular-based treatments, products and protocols, stem cell-related intellectual property and translational research applications.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our accumulated deficit was $78,570,146, our stockholders' deficit was $12,776,146 and our working capital deficiency was $13,651,716. We have historically only generated a modest amount of revenue, and our losses have principally been operating expenses incurred in research and development, marketing and promotional activities in order to commercialize our products and services, plus costs associated with meeting the requirements of being a public company. We expect to continue to incur substantial costs for these activities over at least the next year.\nBased upon our working capital deficiency as of December 31, 2019, and our forecast for continued operating losses, as of such date, we required equity and/or debt financing to continue our operations. As of December 31, 2019, our outstanding debt of $8,393,327, together with interest at rates ranging between 12% and 15% per annum, was due on various dates through December 18, 2020.\nAs discussed in Item 1 of this Annual Report ( Business - Business Development\u201d), on March 20, 2020, we filed a voluntary petition commencing a case under chapter 11 of title 11 of the U.S. Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York. On October 30, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the plan of reorganization and, on November 16, 2020, the plan became effective. As a result of the confirmed plan of reorganization $14,796,000 in outstanding debt and liabilities were exchanged for (i) shares of common stock, (ii) new convertible debt or (iii) new convertible debt and warrants to purchase common stock.\n 31 \n \nWe anticipate that we will require approximately $12,000,000 in financing to commence and complete a Phase 2 clinical trial with regard to our Disc/Spine Program. We anticipate that we will require approximately $45,000,000 in further additional funding to complete such clinical trials (assuming the receipt of no revenues). We will also require a substantial amount of additional funding if we determine to establish a manufacturing operation with regard to our Disc/Spine Program (as opposed to utilizing a third party manufacturer) and to implement our other programs described in Item 1 of this Annual Report ( Business\u201d), including our metabolic ThermoStem Program, repay our outstanding debt (assuming such debt is not converted into equity) and fund general operations. No assurance can be given that the anticipated amounts of required funding are correct or that we will be able to accomplish our goals within the timeframes projected. In addition, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain any required financing on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise.\nWe are currently seeking several different financing alternatives to support our future operations. The plan of reorganization provides that, at such time as we are current in our periodic SEC filings, subject to certain customary conditions, Auctus Fund, LLC ( Auctus\u201d), which provided debtor-in-possession ( DIP\u201d) financing to us during the reorganization process, is to provide a loan to us, as needed, in an amount equal to $3,500,000 less the sum of the DIP loans previously made by Auctus to us (inclusive of accrued interest, of $1,226,901) and the costs incurred by Auctus as the DIP lender. In addition, Auctus and others provided debt financing in the aggregate principal amount of $3,848,548 at the effective date of our plan of reorganization. If we are unable to obtain such financing on a timely basis or other required financing as needed, we may have to curtail our development, marketing and promotional activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately we could be forced to discontinue our operations and liquidate. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe following table presents selected items in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For The Years Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>111,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating Expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketing and promotion </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>321,280 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>352,204 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consulting </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,912,683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,870,829 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,722,338 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,513,150 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,605,704 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,022,469 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Operating Expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,562,005 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,758,652 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss From Operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,432,005 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,647,652 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other (Expense) Income: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,467,952 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(932,187 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amortization of debt discount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,671,087 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,289,591 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on extinguishment of notes payable, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,895,116 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,415,950 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in fair value of derivative liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>788,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(229,323 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Warrant modification expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,100 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Other Expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,215,885 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,870,151 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net Loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,647,890 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,517,803 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 32 \n \nRevenues\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we generated $130,000 and $111,000, respectively, of royalty revenue in connection with our sublicense agreement.\nMarketing and promotion\nMarketing and promotion expenses include advertising and promotion, marketing and seminars, meals, entertainment and travel expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, marketing and promotion expenses remained relatively consistent and decreased by $30,924, or 9%, from $352,204 to $321,280 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe expect that marketing and promotion expenses will increase in the future as we increase our marketing activities following full commercialization of our products and services.\nConsulting\nConsulting expenses consist of consulting fees and stock-based compensation to consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2019, consulting expenses remained relatively consistent and increased by $41,854, or 2%, from $1,870,829 to $1,912,683, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses include cash and non-cash compensation of (a) our Vice President of Research and Development; (b) our Scientific Advisory Board members; and (c) laboratory staff and costs related to our brown fat and disc/spine initiatives. Research and development expenses are expensed as they are incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2019, research and development expenses increased by $209,188, or 14%, from $1,513,150 to $1,722,338, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily a result of an increase of approximately $82,067 in stock-based compensation expense primarily related to options issued to our Scientific Advisory Board members, incremental modification expense related to an option repricing in 2019, and an increase in laboratory staffing.\nWe expect that our research and development expenses will increase with the continuation of the aforementioned initiatives.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, payroll taxes, severance costs and stock-based compensation to employees (excluding any cash or non-cash compensation of our Vice President of Research and Development and our laboratory staff), as well as corporate expenses such as legal and professional fees, investor relations and occupancy related expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, general and administrative expenses increased by $583,235, or 15%, from $4,022,469 to $4,605,704, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily due to an increase of approximately $818,000 in professional financial and legal fees related primarily to matters regarding fundings and conversions of debt, as well as an increase in corporate expenses, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $254,000 in stock-based compensation due to fewer outstanding options in 2019.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we expand our staff, develop our infrastructure and incur additional costs to support the growth of our business.\nInterest expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, interest expense increased $535,765, or 57%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was due to an increase in interest-bearing short-term borrowings as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\n 33 \n \nAmortization of debt discount\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, amortization of debt discount increased $1,381,496, or 60%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased issuances of convertible notes and the timing of the recognition of expense related to the bifurcated embedded conversion options of convertible notes.\nLoss on extinguishment of notes payable, net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of notes payable, net, of $1,895,116, as compared to a loss on extinguishment of notes payable, net of $1,415,950 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is associated with debt repayments and debtholders' exchanges of debt into equity securities resulting in a loss on the exchange.\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a gain related to the change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $788,970 due to the decrease in time value of embedded conversion options within certain convertible notes payable, as compared to a loss related to the change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $229,323 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nWe measure our liquidity in a number of ways, including the following:\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,523 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Working Capital Deficiency </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13,651,716 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,073,901 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Notes Payable (Gross) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,393,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,161,916 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAvailability of Additional Funds\nBased upon our working capital deficiency and stockholders' deficit of $13,651,716 and $12,776,146, respectively, as of December 31, 2019, as of such date, we required additional equity and/or debt financing to continue our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our outstanding debt of $8,393,327, together with interest at rates ranging between 12% and 15% per annum, was due on various dates through December 18, 2020.\nOur operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including our ability to successfully commercialize our products and services, competing technological and market developments, and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings.\nWe may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it or raise capital on favorable terms. Debt financing may require us to pledge certain assets and enter into covenants that could restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our stockholders or us. If we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms, we may be required to significantly curtail or discontinue operations or obtain funds by entering into financing agreements on unattractive terms.\nOur consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n 34 \n \nThe following has been able to mitigate the above factors with regards to our ability to continue as a going concern: (i) as part of our Chapter 11 reorganization approximately $14,700,000 in outstanding debt and other liabilities were exchanged for (a) shares of common stock, (b) new convertible notes or (c) new convertible notes and warrants to purchase shares of common stock; (ii) we secured DIP financing during our Chapter 11 reorganization in the aggregate amount of $1,189,413, and $3,848,548 in debt financing as part of our Chapter 11 reorganization to sustain operations; (iii) we obtained equity and debt financing in the aggregate amount of $451,762 subsequent to December 31, 2019 and prior to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Case; and (iv) pursuant to the plan of reorganization, Auctus is required to loan to us, as needed and subject to our becoming current in our SEC reporting obligations, an additional amount equal to $3,500,000, less the amount of Auctus' DIP financing ($1,226,901, inclusive of accrued interest) and its DIP costs. As a result of the above, we have sufficient cash to fund operations for the twelve months subsequent to the filing date. In addition, the Company will need to obtain further funding of at least $12,000,000 to commence and complete a Phase 2 clinical study of the use of BRTX-100.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our sources and uses of cash were as follows:\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nWe experienced negative cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 in the amounts of $6,918,734 and $5,104,629, respectively. The net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to cash used to fund a net loss of $14,647,890, adjusted for non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of $7,189,303 partially offset by $539,853 of cash generated by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities, primarily as a result of increases in accrued interest, expenses, and other current liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable. The net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to cash used to fund a net loss of $12,517,803, adjusted for non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of $7,458,950 partially offset by $45,776 of cash generated by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities, primarily as a result of increases in accrued interest, expenses, and other current liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, cash used in investing activities was $35,631 and $12,869, respectively, due to cash used for the purchase of office and computer equipment.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $6,838,505 and $4,783,341, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, $10,888,339 of net proceeds were from debt financings, $1,658,500 of net proceeds were from equity financings, partially offset by $5,708,334 of repayments on debt financings and prepayment premiums. During the year ended December 31, 2018, $4,194,173 of net proceeds were from debt financings and other borrowings and $589,168 of net proceeds were from equity financings (including proceeds received in connection with the exercise of common stock purchase warrants) partially offset by $863,302 of repayments on debt financings.\nWe anticipate that the costs to commence and complete our Phase 2 clinical trials with regard to our Disc/Spine Program will be at least $12,000,000. In addition, we anticipate approximately $45,000,000 in additional funding will be needed to complete the clinical trials using BRTX-100 (assuming the receipt of no revenues). As noted above in Availability of Additional Funds\u201d we secured additional funding as part of Chapter 11 reorganization in the aggregate amount of $5,037,961 as well as approximately $14,700,000 in outstanding debt and other liabilities being exchanged for (a) shares of common stock, (b) new convertible notes or (c) new convertible notes and warrants to purchase shares of common stock. Additionally, pursuant to the plan of reorganization, Auctus is required to loan to us, as needed and subject to our becoming current in our SEC reporting obligations, an additional amount equal to $3,500,000, less the amount of Auctus' DIP financing ($1,226,901, inclusive of accrued interest) and its DIP costs. As a result of the above, we have sufficient cash to fund operations for the twelve months subsequent to the filing date.\n 35 \n \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods. Our significant estimates and assumptions include the recoverability and useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair value of our common stock, stock-based compensation, warrants issued in connection with notes payable, derivative liabilities and the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets. Certain of our estimates, including the carrying amount of the intangible assets, could be affected by external conditions, including those unique to us and general economic conditions. It is reasonably possible that these external factors could have an effect on our estimates and could cause actual results to differ from those estimates.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are comprised of trademarks and licenses with original estimated useful lives of 10 and 17.7 years, respectively. Once placed into service, we amortize the cost of the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe review for the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. While our near term liquidity is tight, historically we have been successful in raising capital as needed (although there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in raising capital as needed). We continue to progress our scientific agenda and meet related milestones. We have not identified any impairment losses.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of items that have been included or excluded in our financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts, or temporary differences, at enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.\nWe adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 740-10, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statements recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. For employees and directors, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is generally re-measured on vesting dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value amount is then recognized over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. Since the shares underlying our Equity Participation Plan were registered on May 27, 2014, we estimate the fair value of the awards granted under the Plan based on the market value of our freely tradable common stock as reported on the OTC. The fair value of our restricted equity instruments was estimated by management based on observations of the cash sales prices of both restricted shares and freely tradable shares. Awards granted to directors are treated on the same basis as awards granted to employees.\n 36 \n \nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe evaluate our convertible instruments to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivative financial instruments to be separately accounted for in accordance with Topic 815 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) ASC. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that we record embedded conversion options ( ECOs\u201d) and any related freestanding instruments at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. Conversion options are recorded as a discount to the host instrument and are amortized as amortization of debt discount on the consolidated financial statements over the life of the underlying instrument. We reassess the classification of our derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification.\nThe Multinomial Lattice Model and Black-Scholes Model were used to estimate the fair value of the ECOs of convertible notes payable, the warrants, and stock options that are classified as derivative liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The models include subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. The expected volatility is estimated based on the actual volatility during the most recent historical period of time equal to the weighted average life of the instruments.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nFactors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition\nThe risk factors listed in this section provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. Readers should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nRisks Related to Our Business Generally\nWe have a limited operating history; we have incurred substantial losses since inception; we expect to continue to incur losses for the near term; as of December 31, 2019, we had a substantial working capital deficiency and a stockholders' deficiency and, as a consequence, on March 20, 2020, we filed a voluntary petition commencing a case under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nWe have a limited operating history. Since our inception, we have incurred net losses. As of December 31, 2019, we had a working capital deficiency of $13,651,716 and stockholders' deficit of $12,776,146. As a consequence, on March 20, 2020, we filed a voluntary petition commencing a case under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the Chapter 11 Case\u201d). On October 30, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the plan of reorganization pursuant to the Chapter 11 Case (the Plan of Reorganization\u201d) and on November 16, 2020, the Plan of Reorganization became effective.\n 37 \n \nWe will need to obtain a significant amount of financing to initiate and complete our clinical trials and implement our business plan.\nSince our inception, we have not generated significant revenues from our operations and have funded our operations through the sale of our equity securities and debt securities. The implementation of our business plan, as discussed in Item 1 ( Business\u201d), will require the receipt of sufficient equity and/or debt financing to purchase necessary equipment, technology and materials, fund our clinical trials and other research and development efforts, retire our outstanding debt and otherwise fund our operations. We anticipate that we will require approximately $12,000,000 in financing to commence and complete a Phase 2 clinical trial using BRTX-100. We anticipate that we will require approximately $45,000,000 in further additional funding to complete our clinical trials using BRTX-100 (assuming the receipt of no revenues). We will also require a substantial amount of additional funding to implement our other programs described in Item 1 ( Business\u201d), including our metabolic ThermoStem Program, repay our outstanding debt (assuming such debt is not converted into equity) and fund general operations. We received debtor-in-possession ( DIP\u201d) funding of $1,189,413 during the Chapter 11 Case and debt financing of $3,848,548 on the effective date of the Chapter 11 Case. The Plan of Reorganization provides for additional debt funding of $3,500,000 (less our DIP funding obligation, including accrued interest, of $1,226,901 at the effective date of the Chapter 11 Case, less DIP costs incurred by the DIP lender) as needed, from our DIP lender upon our becoming current in our SEC periodic report filings. The filing of this Annual Report will not satisfy such requirement as to being current with SEC filings. Such additional funding from the DIP lender, if received, will not be sufficient to satisfy our needs. No assurance can be given that the anticipated amounts of required funding are correct or that we will be able to accomplish our goals within the timeframes projected. In addition, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain any required financing on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise. In the event we do not obtain the financing required for the above purposes, we may have to curtail our development, marketing and promotional activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately we could be forced to discontinue our operations and liquidate.\nWe may need to obtain additional financing to satisfy debt obligations. An event of default pursuant to our outstanding debt obligations could trigger an acceleration of the due date of such obligations, including our secured debt.\nAs described in this Item 7 ( Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Availability of Additional Funds\u201d), as of December 31, 2019, our outstanding debt of $8,393,327, together with interest at rates ranging between 12 and 15% per annum, was due on various dates through December 18, 2020. As a consequence of such outstanding debt, as discussed above, on March 20, 2020, we commenced the Chapter 11 Case. Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, we issued 1,049,726,797 shares of common stock in exchange for unsecured claims of approximately $10,497,267. In addition, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, we have issued debt securities in the aggregate principal amount of $9,642,418 and, as indicated above, the DIP lender is required, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, to lend us an additional $3,500,000 (less our DIP funding obligation, including accrued interest, of $1,226,901 at the effective date of the Chapter 11 Case, less DIP costs incurred by the DIP lender), as needed. All such debt is repayable three years from the date of issuance (unless sooner converted into equity); however, an event of default pursuant to the secured and unsecured promissory notes evidencing such indebtedness could trigger an acceleration of the due dates of all of the notes. We do not have the financial resources to satisfy such debt obligations. Since the repayment of a substantial portion of our outstanding debt is secured by a security interest in all of our assets, in the event of a default, and foreclosure upon our assets, we could be forced to cease operations and liquidate.\nOur business strategy is high risk.\nWe are focusing our resources and efforts primarily on the development of cellular-based products and services which will require extensive cash for research, development and commercialization activities. This is a high-risk strategy because there is no assurance that our products and services, including our Disc/Spine Program and our ThermoStem metabolic brown fat research initiative, will ever become commercially viable (commercial risk), that we will prevent other companies from depriving us of market share and profit margins by offering services and products based on our inventions and developments (legal risk), that we will successfully manage a company in a new area of business, regenerative medicine, and on a different scale than we have operated in the past (operational risk), that we will be able to achieve the desired therapeutic results using stem and regenerative cells (scientific risk), or that our cash resources will be adequate to develop our products and services until we become profitable, if ever (financial risk). We are using our cash in one of the riskiest industries in the economy (strategic risk). This may make our securities an unsuitable investment for many investors.\nWe will need to enter into agreements in order to implement our business strategy.\nExcept for a certain license agreement with Regenerative Sciences, LLC described in Item 1 ( Business - Disc/Spine Program - License\u201d), we do not have any material agreements or understandings in place with respect to the implementation of our business strategy. No assurances can be given that we will be able to enter into any necessary agreements with respect to the development of our business. Our inability to enter into any such agreements would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n 38 \n \nWe depend on our executive officers and on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel; we do not currently have a Chief Financial Officer.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance of Lance Alstodt, our Chief Executive Officer. We rely upon him for strategic business decisions and guidance. Mr. Alstodt is not subject to an employment agreement with us. We are also dependent on the performance of Francisco Silva, our Vice President of Research and Development. Mr. Silva is subject to an employment agreement with us. We do not have any key-man insurance policies on the lives of either of our executive officers. We do not currently have a Chief Financial Officer. Pending the hiring of a Chief Financial Officer, we are utilizing financial consultants with regard to the preparation of our financial statements. We believe that our future success in developing marketable products and services and achieving a competitive position will depend in large part upon whether we can attract and retain additional qualified management and scientific personnel, including a Chief Financial Officer. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel. The loss of the services of Mr. Alstodt and/or Mr. Silva or the inability to attract and retain additional personnel, including a Chief Financial Officer, and develop expertise as needed would have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our results of operations and prospects.\nBeginning in March 2020, the global pandemic related to the novel coronavirus COVID-19 began to impact the global economy. Because of the size and breadth of this pandemic, all of the direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 are not yet known and may not emerge for some time. Risks presented by the ongoing effects of COVID-19 include, among others, the following:\nClinical Trials. We anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact our contemplated clinical trials. Due to the worldwide efforts being taken to combat COVID-19 and the increased clinical work being done in this respect, we believe that it may be difficult for certain needed laboratory supplies, equipment and other materials to be obtained in order to conduct our clinical trials. We also anticipate that, due to a fear of COVID-19 transmission, there may be a hesitancy on the part of certain individuals to become clinical trial participants. We hope that these possible negative effects will lessen as more of the population becomes vaccinated; however, the impact that the vaccinations will have is uncertain at this time.\nAdverse Legislative and/or Regulatory Action. Federal, state and local government actions to address and contain the impact of COVID-19 may adversely affect us. For example, we may be subject to legislative and/or regulatory action that negatively impacts the manner in which the clinical trials may be conducted.\nOperational Disruptions and Heightened Cybersecurity Risks. Our operations could be disrupted if key members of our senior management or a significant percentage of our workforce are unable to continue to work because of illness, government directives or otherwise. In addition, in connection with increased remote working arrangements, we face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents and are more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities.\nRisks Related to Our Cell Therapy Product Development Efforts\nOur future success is significantly dependent on the timely and successful development and commercialization of BRTX-100, our lead product candidate for the treatment of chronic lumbar disc disease; if we encounter delays or difficulties in the development of this product candidate, as well as any other product candidates, our business prospects would be significantly harmed.\nWe are dependent upon the successful development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates. Before we are able to seek regulatory approval of our product candidates, we must conduct and complete extensive clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy in humans. Our lead product candidate, BRTX-100, is in early stages of development and we have not yet commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial using BRTX-100 to treat chronic lower back pain due to degenerative disc disease related to protruding/bulging discs.\n 39 \n \nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, and can take many years to complete. Importantly, a failure of one or more of these or any other clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to complete our clinical studies, receive regulatory approval or commercialize our cell therapy product candidates, including the following:\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>suspensions, delays or changes in the design, initiation, enrollment, implementation or completion of required clinical trials;

clinical trial results that are negative, inconclusive or less than desired as to safety and/or efficacy, which could result in the need for additional clinical studies or the termination of the product's development;

In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may be required, or we may elect, to conduct additional studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical study delays could also shorten any periods during which our products have patent protection and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nEven if we are able to successfully complete our clinical development program for our product candidates, and ultimately receive regulatory approval to market one or more of the products, we may, among other things:\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as the indications we sought; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>encounter issues with respect to the manufacturing of commercial supplies; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; and/or </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>be subject to restrictions on how the product is distributed or used. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe anticipate that we will not be able to commercialize our BRTX-100 product candidate for at least five years.\nWe may experience delays and other difficulties in enrolling a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials which could delay or prevent the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals.\nWe may not be able to initiate or complete as planned any clinical trials if we are unable to identify and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. We also may be unable to engage a sufficient number of clinical trial sites to conduct our trials.\nWe may face challenges in enrolling patients to participate in our clinical trials due to the novelty of our cell-based therapies, the size of the patient populations and the eligibility criteria for enrollment in the trial. In addition, some patients may have concerns regarding cell therapy that may negatively affect their perception of therapies under development and their decision to enroll in the trials. Furthermore, patients suffering from diseases within target indications may enroll in competing clinical trials, which could negatively affect our ability to complete enrollment of our trials. Enrollment challenges in clinical trials often result in increased development costs for a product candidate, significant delays and potentially the abandonment of the clinical trial.\nWe may have other delays in completing our clinical trials and we may not complete them at all.\nWe have not commenced the clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA approval to market our product candidate, BRTX-100, or any of our other product candidates in development. Since our Company lacks significant experience in completing clinical trials and bringing a drug through commercialization, we have hired outside consultants with such experience. Clinical trials for BRTX-100 and other product candidates in development may be delayed or terminated as a result of many factors, including the following:\n \u25cf patients failing to complete clinical trials due to dissatisfaction with the treatment, side effects or other reasons; \u25cf failure by regulators to authorize us to commence a clinical trial; \u25cf suspension or termination by regulators of clinical research for many reasons, including concerns about patient safety, the failure of study sites and/or investigators in our clinical research program to comply with GCP requirements, or our failure, or the failure of our contract manufacturers, to comply with current cGMP requirements; \u25cf delays or failure to obtain clinical supply for our products necessary to conduct clinical trials from contract manufacturers; \n 41 \n \n \u25cf treatment candidates demonstrating a lack of efficacy during clinical trials; \u25cf treatment candidates demonstrating significant safety signals; and/or \u25cf inability to continue to fund clinical trials or to find a partner to fund the clinical trials. \nAny delay or failure to complete clinical trials and obtain FDA approval for our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our cost to develop and commercialize, and our ability to generate revenue from, a particular product candidate.\nThe development of our cell therapy product candidates is subject to uncertainty because autologous cell therapy is inherently variable.\nWhen manufacturing an autologous cell therapy, the number and composition of the cell population varies from patient to patient. Such variability in the number and composition of these cells could adversely affect our ability to manufacture autologous cell therapies in a cost-effective or profitable manner and meet acceptable product release specifications for use in a clinical trial or, if approved, for commercial sale. As a consequence, the development and regulatory approval process for autologous cell therapy products could be delayed or may never be completed.\nAny disruption to our access to the media (including cell culture media) and reagents we are using in the clinical development of our cell therapy product candidates could adversely affect our ability to perform clinical trials and seek future regulatory submissions.\nCertain media (including cell culture media) and reagents, as well as devices, materials and systems, that we intend to use in our planned clinical trials, and that we may need or use in commercial production, are provided by unaffiliated third parties. Any lack of continued availability of these media, reagents, devices, materials and systems for any reason would have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete these studies and could adversely impact our ability to achieve commercial manufacture of our planned therapeutic products. Although other available sources for these media, reagents, devices, materials and systems may exist in the marketplace, we have not evaluated their cost, effectiveness, or intellectual property foundation and therefore cannot guarantee the suitability or availability of such other potential sources.\nProducts that appear promising in research and development may be delayed or may fail to reach later stages of clinical development.\nThe successful development of cellular based products is highly uncertain. Product candidates that appear promising in preclinical and early research and development may be delayed or fail to reach later stages of development. Decisions regarding the further development of product candidates must be made with limited and incomplete data, which makes it difficult to ensure or even accurately predict whether the allocation of limited resources and the expenditure of additional capital on specific product candidates will result in desired outcomes. Pre-clinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways, and negative or inconclusive results or adverse events during a clinical trial could delay, limit or prevent the development of a product candidate. Positive preclinical data may not continue or occur for future subjects in our clinical studies and may not be repeated or observed in ongoing or future studies involving our product candidates. Furthermore, our product candidates may also fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in later stages of clinical development despite having successfully advanced through initial clinical studies. In addition, regulatory delays or rejections may be encountered as a result of many factors, including changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development.\nOur clinical trials may fail to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, which would prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization.\nThe clinical trials of our product candidates are, and the manufacturing and marketing of our products will be, subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and in other countries where we intend to test and market our product candidates. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate through lengthy, complex and expensive preclinical testing and clinical trials that our product candidates are both safe and effective for use in each target indication. In particular, because our product candidates are subject to regulation as biological drug products, we will need to demonstrate that they are safe, pure, and potent for use in their target indications. Each product candidate must demonstrate an adequate risk versus benefit profile in its intended patient population and for its intended use. The risk/benefit profile required for product licensure will vary depending on these factors and may include decrease or elimination of pain, adequate duration of response, a delay in the progression of the disease, an improvement in function and/or decrease in disability.\n 42 \n \nIn addition, even if such trials are successfully completed, we cannot guarantee that the FDA will interpret the results as we do, and more trials could be required before we submit our product candidates for approval. To the extent that the results of the trials are not satisfactory to the FDA for support of a marketing application, we may be required to expend significant resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of our product candidates.\nEven if we complete the necessary clinical trials, we cannot predict when, or if, we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate, and the approval may be for a narrower indication than we seek.\nWe cannot commercialize a product candidate until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the product candidate. Even if our product candidates meet their safety and efficacy endpoints in clinical trials, the regulatory authorities may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval. Additional delays may result if an FDA Advisory Committee or other regulatory authority recommends non-approval or restrictions or conditions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory authority policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and the review process. Regulatory authorities also may approve a product candidate for more limited indications than requested or they may impose significant limitations in the form of narrow indications, contraindications or a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS\u201d). These regulatory authorities may require warnings or precautions with respect to conditions of use or they may grant approval subject to the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, regulatory authorities may not approve the labeling claims or allow the promotional claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may never obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates in the United States and, even if we do, we may never obtain approval for or commercialize any of our product candidates in any foreign jurisdiction, which would limit our ability to realize our full market potential.\nIn order to eventually market any of our product candidates in any particular foreign jurisdiction, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements regarding safety and efficacy on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. Approval by the FDA in the United States, if obtained, does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions. In addition, preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other country.\nApproval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our product candidates in those countries. The foreign regulatory approval process involves similar risks to those associated with FDA approval. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including international markets, nor have we attempted to obtain such approval. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products may be unrealized.\nWe presently lack manufacturing capabilities to produce our product candidates at commercial scale quantities and do not have an alternate manufacturing supply, which could negatively impact our ability to meet any future demand for the products.\nCurrently, we expect our laboratory (or a contract laboratory) to provide the cell processing services necessary for clinical production of BRTX-100 for our disc clinical trial. To date, we have not produced any products at our laboratory. We expect that we would need to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities to meet potential commercial demand for BRTX-100 and any other of our product candidates, if approved, as well as any of our other product candidates that might attain regulatory approval. Such expansion would require additional regulatory approvals. Even if we increase our manufacturing capabilities, it is possible that we may still lack sufficient capacity to meet demand. Ultimately, if we are unable to supply our products to meet commercial demand, whether because of processing constraints or other disruptions, delays or difficulties that we experience, sales of the products and their long-term commercial prospects could be significantly damaged.\n 43 \n \nWe do not presently have a third-party manufacturer for BRTX-100 or any of our other product candidates. If our facilities at which these product candidates would be manufactured or our equipment were significantly damaged or destroyed, or if there were other disruptions, delays or difficulties affecting manufacturing capacity, our planned and future clinical studies and commercial production for these product candidates would likely be significantly disrupted and delayed. It would be both time consuming and expensive to replace this capacity with third parties, particularly since any new facility would need to comply with the regulatory requirements.\nUltimately, if we are unable to supply our cell therapy product candidates to meet commercial demand (assuming commercial approval is obtained), whether because of processing constraints or other disruptions, delays or difficulties that we experience, our production costs could dramatically increase and sales of the product and its long-term commercial prospects could be significantly damaged.\nThe commercial potential and profitability of our products are unknown and subject to significant risk and uncertainty.\nEven if we successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for our cell therapy product candidates, the market may not understand or accept the products, which could adversely affect both the timing and level of future sales. Ultimately, the degree of market acceptance of our product candidates (or any of our future product candidates) will depend on a number of factors, including:\n \u25cf the clinical effectiveness, safety and convenience of the product particularly in relation to alternative treatments; \u25cf our ability to distinguish our products (which involve adult cells) from any ethical and political controversies associated with stem cell products derived from human embryonic or fetal tissue; and \u25cf the cost of the product, the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors and our ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement. \nEven if we are successful in achieving sales of our product candidates, it is not clear to what extent, if any, the products will be profitable. The costs of goods associated with production of cell therapy products are significant. In addition, some changes in manufacturing processes or procedures generally require FDA or foreign regulatory authority review and approval prior to implementation. We may need to conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials to support approval of any such changes. Furthermore, this review process could be costly and time-consuming and could delay or prevent the commercialization of product candidates.\nWe may have difficulties in sourcing brown adipose (fat) tissue.\nWe use brown adipose (fat) tissue to identify and characterize brown adipose derived stem cells for use in our pre-clinical ThermoStem Program. There is no certainty that we will be able to continue to collect brown adipose samples through any relationships that we have, have had or may establish with potential sources of brown adipose tissue. The inability to procure brown fat tissue would have a material adverse effect upon our ability to advance our ThermoStem Program.\nWe are required to complete a certain milestone to maintain our exclusive license rights with regard to the disc/spine technology. The loss of such exclusive rights would have a material adverse effect upon us.\nPursuant to our license agreement with Regenerative Sciences, LLC, we must complete our Phase 2 clinical trial by a certain date (which we believe to be February 2022) in order to maintain our exclusive rights with regard to the disc/spine technology. It is not anticipated that we will achieve such milestone. Any loss of such exclusive rights would have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Business-Disc/Spine Program - License.\u201d\n 44 \n \nIf safety problems are encountered by us or others developing new stem cell-based therapies, our stem cell initiatives could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe use of stem cells for therapeutic indications is still in the very early stages of development. If an adverse event occurs during clinical trials related to one of our proposed products and/or services or those of others, the FDA and other regulatory authorities may halt clinical trials or require additional studies. The occurrence of any of these events would delay, and increase the cost of, our development efforts and may render the commercialization of our proposed products and/or services impractical or impossible.\nWe are vulnerable to competition and technological change, and also to physicians' inertia.\nWe will compete with many domestic and foreign companies in developing our technology and products, including biotechnology, medical device and pharmaceutical companies. Many current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing, and personnel resources. There is no assurance that our competitors will not succeed in developing alternative products and/or services that are more effective, easier to use, or more economical than those which we may develop, or that would render our products and/or services obsolete and non-competitive. In general, we may not be able to prevent others from developing and marketing competitive products and/or services similar to ours or which perform similar functions or which are marketed before ours.\nCompetitors may have greater experience in developing products, therapies or devices, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals, manufacturing and commercialization. It is possible that competitors may obtain patent protection, approval or clearance from the FDA or achieve commercialization earlier than we can, any of which could have a substantial negative effect on our business.\nWe will compete against cell-based therapies derived from alternate sources, such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord blood and potentially embryos. Doctors historically are slow to adopt new technologies like ours, whatever the merits, when older technologies continue to be supported by established providers. Overcoming such inertia often requires very significant marketing expenditures or definitive product performance and/or pricing superiority.\nWe expect that physicians' inertia and skepticism will also be a significant barrier as we attempt to gain market penetration with our future products and services. We may need to finance lengthy time-consuming clinical studies (so as to provide convincing evidence of the medical benefit) in order to overcome this inertia and skepticism.\nWe may form or seek collaborations or strategic alliances or enter into additional licensing arrangements in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances or licensing arrangements.\nWe may form or seek strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations, or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to our product candidates and any future product candidates that we may develop. Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute the shares of our existing stockholders, or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. To date, such efforts have not been successful.\nFurther, collaborations involving our product candidates, such as our collaborations with third-party research institutions, are subject to numerous risks, which may include the following:\n \u25cf collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to a collaboration; \u25cf collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products, availability of funding, or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities; \n 45 \n \n \u25cf collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial, stop a clinical trial, abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing; \u25cf collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates; \u25cf a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to their marketing and distribution; \u25cf collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability; \u25cf disputes may arise between us and a collaborator that cause the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; \u25cf collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates; and \u25cf collaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our products that results from our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we would not have the exclusive right to commercialize such intellectual property. \nAs a result, if we enter into collaboration agreements and strategic partnerships or license our products or businesses, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture, which could delay our timelines or otherwise adversely affect our business. We also cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction. Any delays in entering into new collaborations or strategic partnership agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates in certain geographies for certain indications, which would harm our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have limited experience in the development and marketing of cell therapies and may be unsuccessful in our efforts to establish a profitable business.\nOur business plan has been focused historically on capturing a piece of the burgeoning field of cell therapy. We have limited experience in the areas of cell therapy product development and marketing, and in the related regulatory issues and processes. Although we have recruited a team that has experience with designing and conducting clinical trials and hired contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations and FDA consultants, as a company, we have limited experience in conducting clinical trials and no experience in conducting clinical trials through to regulatory approval of any product candidate. In part because of this lack of experience, we cannot be certain that planned clinical trials will begin or be completed on time, if at all. We cannot assure that we will successfully achieve our clinical development goals or fulfill our plans to capture a piece of the cell therapy market.\nOur cell therapy business is based on novel technologies that are inherently expensive, risky and may not be understood by or accepted in the marketplace, which could adversely affect our future value.\nThe clinical development, commercialization and marketing of cell and tissue-based therapies are at an early-stage, substantially research-oriented, and financially speculative. To date, very few companies have been successful in their efforts to develop and commercialize a cell therapy product. In general, cell-based or tissue-based products may be susceptible to various risks, including undesirable and unintended side effects, unintended immune system responses, inadequate therapeutic efficacy, or other characteristics that may prevent or limit their approval or commercial use. In addition, BRTX-100 is a cell-based candidate that is produced by using a patient's own stem cells derived from bone marrow. Regulatory approval of novel product candidates such as BRTX-100, which is manufactured using novel manufacturing processes, can be more complex and expensive and take longer than other, more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical products, due to the FDA's lack of experience with them. To our knowledge, the FDA has not yet approved a disc related stem cell therapy product. This lack of experience may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to conduct additional studies or clinical trials, which would increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these product candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. Furthermore, the number of people who may use cell or tissue-based therapies is difficult to forecast with accuracy. Our future success is dependent on the establishment of a large global market for cell- and tissue-based therapies and our ability to capture a share of this market with our product candidates.\n 46 \n \nOur cell therapy product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biologic products may face competition sooner than anticipated.\nThe enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 ( BPCIA\u201d) created an abbreviated regulatory pathway for the approval of products demonstrated to be biosimilar, or highly similar,\u201d to or interchangeable\u201d with an FDA-approved innovator (original) biologic product. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable\u201d based on its similarity to an existing reference product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product is approved under a biologics license application ( BLA\u201d). Although the FDA has approved several biosimilar products, complex provisions of the law are still being implemented by the FDA and interpreted by the federal courts. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning of the BPCIA are still subject to some uncertainty and FDA actions and court decisions concerning the law could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.\nWe believe that, if any of our product candidates are approved as a biological product under a BLA, it should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that the FDA could approve biosimilar applicants for other reference products that no longer have such exclusivity, thus potentially creating the opportunity for greater competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nThe FDA's regulation of regenerative medicine products remains unpredictable and we are not certain what impact this will have on the potential approval of our products.\nThe FDA's regulation of therapies derived from stem cell products and technologies is evolving and may continue to evolve. In December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (the Cures Act\u201d) was signed into law in the United States to advance access to medical innovations. Among other things, the Cures Act established a new FDA regenerative medicine advanced therapy ( RMAT\u201d) designation. This designation offers a variety of benefits to product candidates, including enhanced FDA support during clinical development, priority review on application filing, accelerated approval based on potential surrogate endpoints, and the potential use of patient registry data and other forms of real world evidence for post-approval confirmatory studies. There is no certainty that any of our product candidates will receive RMAT designation or any other type of expedited review program designation from the FDA. In any event, the receipt of an FDA RMAT designation or other expedited review program designation may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to products considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA.\nWe may be subject to significant product liability claims and litigation, including potential exposure from the use of our product candidates in human subjects, and our insurance may be inadequate to cover claims that may arise.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks inherent in the testing, processing and marketing of cell therapy products. Such liability claims may be expensive to defend and result in large judgments against us. We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our current and any future product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk with respect to any commercial sales of our products should they be approved. No product candidate has been widely used over an extended period of time, and therefore safety data is limited. Cell therapy companies derive the raw materials for manufacturing of product candidates from human cell sources, and therefore the manufacturing process and handling requirements are extensive, which increases the risk of quality failures and subsequent product liability claims.\nWe will need to maintain insurance coverage adequate to cover our clinical trials and increase that coverage before commercializing product candidates, if ever. At any time during our clinical trials or after commercialization, if that occurs, we may not be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or at all, or if claims against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our financial position could be significantly impaired.\n 47 \n \nWhether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation that may arise, such litigation could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, result in decreased demand for our products and injure our reputation.\nWe seek to maintain errors and omissions, directors and officers, workers' compensation and other insurance at levels we believe to be appropriate to our business activities. If, however, we were subject to a claim in excess of this coverage or to a claim not covered by our insurance and the claim succeeded, we would be required to pay the claim from our own limited resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business. Additionally, liability or alleged liability could harm our business by diverting the attention and resources of our management and damaging our reputation.\nOur internal computer systems, or those that are expected to be used by our clinical investigators, clinical research organizations or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of development programs for our product candidates.\nWe rely on information technology systems to keep financial records, maintain laboratory and corporate records, communicate with staff and external parties and operate other critical functions. Any significant degradation or failure of these computer systems could cause us to inaccurately calculate or lose data. Despite the implementation of security measures, these internal computer systems and those used by our clinical investigators, clinical research organizations, and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. The techniques that could be used by criminal elements or foreign governments to attack these computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. While we have not experienced any such system failure, theft of information, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our clinical development activities. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from historical or future clinical trials could result in delays in regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption, theft of information, or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the clinical development and the future development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nTo operate and sell in international markets carries great risk.\nWe intend to market our products and services both domestically and in foreign markets. A number of risks are inherent in international transactions. In order for us to market our products and services in non-U.S. jurisdictions, we need to obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals or clearances in these countries and must comply with the country specific regulations regarding safety, manufacturing processes and quality. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearances to market, may differ from the FDA regulatory scheme. International operations and sales also may be limited or disrupted by political instability, price controls, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs. Additionally, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect demand for our services and products by increasing the price of our products and services in the currency of the countries in which the products and services are offered.\nThere can be no assurance that we will obtain regulatory approvals or clearances in all of the countries where we intend to market our products and services, or that we will not incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or clearances, or that we will be able to successfully commercialize our products and services in various foreign markets. Delays in receipt of approvals or clearances to market our products and services in foreign countries, failure to receive such approvals or clearances or the future loss of previously received approvals or clearances could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to obtain reimbursement for our products and services from private and governmental insurers could negatively impact demand for our products and services.\nMarket acceptance and sales of our product candidates may depend on coverage and reimbursement policies and health care reform measures. Decisions about formulary coverage as well as levels at which government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, reimburse patients for the price they pay for our product candidates, as well as levels at which these payors pay directly for our product candidates, where applicable, could affect whether we are able to successfully commercialize these products. We cannot guarantee that reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates. We also cannot guarantee that coverage or reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our product candidates.\n 48 \n \nIf coverage and reimbursement are not available or are available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA\u201d) and other health reform proposals include measures that would limit or prohibit payments for certain medical treatments or subject the pricing of drugs to government control. In addition, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the European Union (the EU\u201d), the pricing of drugs and biologics is subject to government control. If our products are or become subject to government regulation that limits or prohibits payment for our products, or that subjects the price of our products to government control, we may not be able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.\nIn addition, third-party payors are increasingly limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs and biologics. They may also impose strict prior authorization requirements and/or refuse to provide any coverage of uses of approved products for medical indications other than those for which the FDA has granted market approvals. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payors will reimburse patients for their use of newly-approved drugs and biologics. If we are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement for our product candidates, our ability to successfully market and sell our product candidates will be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary rights.\nOur commercial success will depend in large part upon our ability to protect our proprietary rights. There is no assurance, for example, that any additional patents will be issued based on our or our licensor's pending applications or, if issued, that such patents will not become the subject of a re-examination, will provide us with competitive advantages, will not be challenged by any third parties, or that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products and services incorporating our technology. Furthermore, there can be no guarantee that others will not independently develop similar products and services, duplicate any of our products and services, or design around any patents we obtain.\nOur commercial success will also depend upon our ability to avoid infringing patents issued to others. If we were judicially determined to be infringing on any third-party patent, we could be required to pay damages, alter our products, services or processes, obtain licenses, or cease certain activities. If we are required in the future to obtain any licenses from third parties for some of our products and/or services, there can be no guarantee that we would be able to do so on commercially favorable terms, if at all. United States and foreign patent applications are not immediately made public, so we might be surprised by the grant to someone else of a patent on a technology we are actively using. Although we conducted a freedom to operate ( FTO\u201d) search on the licensed technology associated with our Disc/Spine Program, modifications made, and/or further developments that may be made, to that technology may not be covered by the initial FTO. No FTO has been undertaken with respect to our ThermoStem brown fat initiative.\nLitigation, which would result in substantial costs to us and the diversion of effort on our part, may be necessary to enforce or confirm the ownership of any patents issued or licensed to us, or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. If our competitors claim technology also claimed by us and prepare and file patent applications in the United States, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the Patent Office\u201d) or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of effort, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Any such litigation or interference proceeding, regardless of outcome, could be expensive and time-consuming.\nSuccessful challenges to our patents through oppositions, re-examination proceedings or interference proceedings could result in a loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we are unsuccessful in actions we bring against the patents of other parties, and it is determined that we infringe upon the patents of third parties, we may be subject to litigation, or otherwise prevented from commercializing potential products and/or services in the relevant jurisdiction, or may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or develop or obtain alternative technologies, any of which could harm our business. Furthermore, if such challenges to our patent rights are not resolved in our favor, we could be delayed or prevented from entering into new collaborations or from commercializing certain products and/or services, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n 49 \n \nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation. In addition, during the course of litigation there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. Some of our intended future cell-related therapeutic products and/or services may fit into this category. We also rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with our partners, employees, advisors, vendors, and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. There can be no guarantee that these agreements will not be breached, or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.\nFailure to obtain or maintain patent protection, failure to protect trade secrets, third-party claims against our patents, trade secrets, or proprietary rights or our involvement in disputes over our patents, trade secrets, or proprietary rights, including involvement in litigation, could divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business and have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property in countries outside of the United States.\nIntellectual property law outside the United States is uncertain and, in many countries, is currently undergoing review and revisions. The laws of some countries do not protect our patent and other intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States laws. Third parties may attempt to oppose the issuance of patents to us in foreign countries by initiating opposition proceedings. Opposition proceedings against any of our patent filings in a foreign country could have an adverse effect on our corresponding patents that are issued or pending in the United States. It may be necessary or useful for us to participate in proceedings to determine the validity of our patents or our competitors' patents that have been issued in countries other than the United States. This could result in substantial costs, divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges to United States patent law may have a material adverse effect on our intellectual property rights.\nThe Leahy-Smith America Invents Act ( AIA\u201d), which was signed into law in 2011, significantly changes United States patent law. It may take some time to establish what the law means, since it is just being interpreted by the lower courts, Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal, and the Supreme Court. The effects of these decisions are still not known. The first major change is that AIA switches the United States patent system from a first to invent\u201d system to a first to file\u201d system. Now that the first to file system is in effect, there is a risk that another company may independently develop identical or similar patents at approximately the same time, and be awarded the patents instead of us. Further, for the second major change, AIA abolished interference proceedings, and establishes derivation proceedings to replace interference proceedings in all cases in which the time period for instituting an interference proceeding has not lapsed where an inventor named in an earlier application derived the claimed invention from a named inventor. Now that the derivation proceedings are in effect, there is a risk that the inventorship of any pending patent application can be challenged for reasons of derivation. The third major change is that AIA established post-grant opposition proceedings that will apply only to patent applications filed after first to file\u201d became effective. Post-grant opposition will enable a person who is not the patent owner to initiate proceedings in the Patent Office within nine months after the grant of a patent that can result in cancellation of a patent as invalid. In addition to AIA, recent court decisions have created uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain and maintain patents. Therefore there is a risk that any of our patents once granted may be subject to post-grant opposition, which will increase uncertainty on the validity of any newly granted patent or may ultimately result in cancellation of the patent.\nIn addition, the Supreme Court has recently taken more limiting positions as to what constitutes patentable subject matter. As a result, many patents covering what were previously patentable inventions are now determined to cover inventions which are deemed non-statutory subject matter and are now invalid. As a result of this and subsequent opinions by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the Patent Office is now applying more stringent limitations to claims in patent applications and is refusing to grant patents in areas of technology where patents were previously deemed available. Therefore there is a risk that we will be unable to acquire patents to cover our products and if such patents are granted they may subsequently be found to be invalid.\n 50 \n \nIn certain countries, patent holders may be required to grant compulsory licenses, which would likely have a significant and detrimental effect on any future revenues in such country.\nMany countries, including some countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, most countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may be limited to monetary relief and may be unable to enjoin infringement, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. Compulsory licensing of life-saving products is also becoming increasingly common in developing countries, either through direct legislation or international initiatives. Such compulsory licenses could be extended to our product candidates, which may limit our potential revenue opportunities, including with respect to any future revenues that may result from our product candidates.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, our products will remain subject to regulatory oversight.\nOur product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information. Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates also may be subject to a REMS or the specific obligations imposed as a condition for marketing authorization by equivalent authorities in a foreign jurisdiction, limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the quality, safety and efficacy of the product. For example, in the United States, the holder of an approved new drug application ( NDA\u201d) or BLA is obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA or BLA. The holder of an approved NDA or BLA also must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ( FDCA\u201d) and implementing regulations and are subject to FDA oversight and post-marketing reporting obligations, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws.\nIn addition, product manufacturers and their facilities may be subject to payment of application and program fees and are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP requirements and adherence to commitments made in the NDA, BLA or foreign marketing application. If we or a regulatory authority discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or if a regulatory authority disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of our product, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions relative to that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements for any product candidate following approval, a regulatory authority may:\n \u25cf issue a warning or untitled letter asserting that we are in violation of the law; \u25cf seek an injunction or impose administrative, civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines; \u25cf suspend or withdraw regulatory approval; \u25cf suspend any ongoing clinical trials; \u25cf refuse to approve a pending BLA or comparable foreign marketing application (or any supplements thereto) submitted by us or our strategic partners; \u25cf restrict the marketing or manufacturing of the product; \u25cf seize or detain the product or otherwise demand or require the withdrawal or recall of the product from the market; \u25cf refuse to permit the import or export of products; \u25cf request and publicize a voluntary recall of the product; or \u25cf refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. \n 51 \n \nAny government enforcement action or investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nIn the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drugs and biologic products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local authorities, including the FDA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d), other divisions the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS\u201d) (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice offices of the United States Attorney, the Federal Trade Commission and state and local governments. Our operations are directly, or indirectly through our prescribers, customers and purchasers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute ( AKS\u201d), the federal civil and criminal False Claims Act ( FCA\u201d), the Physician Payments Sunshine Act and regulations and equivalent provisions in other countries. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy laws by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.\nState and federal regulatory and enforcement agencies continue actively to investigate violations of health care laws and regulations, and the United States Congress continues to strengthen the arsenal of enforcement tools. Most recently, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the criminal and civil penalties that can be imposed for violating certain federal health care laws, including the AKS. Enforcement agencies also continue to pursue novel theories of liability under these laws. Government agencies have recently increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement activity with respect to programs supported or sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, including reimbursement and co-pay support, funding of independent charitable foundations and other programs that offer benefits for patients. Several investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other government regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business.\nFurther, in the event we determine to operate in foreign jurisdictions, including conducting clinical trials, we will need to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the FCPA\u201d). The FCPA prohibits a corporation, including its subsidiaries, third-party contractors, distributors, consultants and employees, from corruptly making or offering to make payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or enhancing business. Under the law, foreign officials\u201d include employees of health systems operated by government entities. The FCPA also establishes specific record-keeping and internal accounting controls. Violations of the FCPA can result in the imposition of civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Failure to comply with the FCPA will adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to the FCPA, we will also need to comply with the foreign government laws and regulations of each individual country in which any therapy centers that we may establish are located and products are to be distributed and sold. These regulations vary in complexity and can be as stringent, and on occasion even more stringent, than FDA regulations in the United States. Due to the fact that there are new and emerging stem cell and cell therapy regulations that have recently been drafted and/or implemented in various countries around the world, the application and subsequent implementation of these new and emerging regulations have little to no precedence. Therefore, the level of complexity and stringency is not always precisely understood today for each country, creating greater uncertainty for the international regulatory process. Furthermore, there can be no guarantee that laws and regulations will not be implemented, amended and/or reinterpreted in a way that will negatively affect our business. Likewise, there can be no assurance that we will be able, or will have the resources, to maintain compliance with all such healthcare laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such healthcare laws and regulations, as well as the costs associated with such compliance or with enforcement of such healthcare laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our operations or may require restructuring of our operations or impair our ability to operate profitably.\n 52 \n \nOur current and future employees, consultants and advisors and our future principal investigators, medical institutions and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our current and future employees, consultants and advisors and our future principal investigators, medical institutions and commercial partners, including contract laboratories, and CROs. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or the regulations applicable in other jurisdictions, provide accurate information to the FDA and other regulatory authorities, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us.\nWe currently do not and in the future may not independently conduct all aspects of our product candidate research and preclinical and clinical testing and product candidate manufacturing. If we rely on third parties, including CROs, medical institutions, and contract laboratories to monitor and manage data for our ongoing preclinical and clinical programs, we will still maintain responsibility for ensuring their activities are conducted in accordance with the applicable study protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards. We and our third-party vendors will be required to comply with current cGMP, GCP, and Good Laboratory Practice ( GLP\u201d) requirements, which are a collection of laws and regulations enforced by the FDA, the EU and comparable foreign authorities for all of our product candidates in clinical development.\nIn addition, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Such misconduct also could involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or interactions with the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation.\nThe precautions we take to detect and prevent employee and third-party misconduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nThe failure to receive regulatory approvals for our cell therapy product candidates would likely have a material and adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nTo date, we have not received regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates in any jurisdiction. If we seek approval of any of our cell therapy product candidates, we will be required to submit to the FDA and potentially other regulatory authorities extensive pre-clinical and clinical data supporting its safety and efficacy, as well as information about the manufacturing process and to undergo inspection of our manufacturing facility or other contract manufacturing facilities, among other things. The process of obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals is expensive, generally takes many years and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, particularly with complex and/or novel product candidates such as our cell-based product candidates. Changes in regulatory approval requirements or policies may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application or may make it easier for our competitors to gain regulatory approval to enter the marketplace. Ultimately, the FDA and other regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our product candidate data are insufficient for approval without the submission of additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying agency interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate. Any difficulties or failures that we encounter in securing regulatory approval for our product candidates would likely have a substantial adverse impact on our ability to generate product sales, and could make any search for a collaborative partner more difficult. Similarly, any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\n 53 \n \nIf we are unable to conduct clinical studies in accordance with regulations and accepted standards, we may be delayed in receiving, or may never receive, regulatory approvals of our product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.\nTo obtain marketing approvals for our product candidates in the United States and abroad, we must, among other requirements, complete adequate and well-controlled clinical trials sufficient to demonstrate to the FDA and other regulatory bodies that the product candidate is safe and effective for each indication for which approval is sought. If the FDA finds that patients enrolled in the trial are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury, due to, among other things, occurrence of a serious adverse event in an ongoing clinical trial, the FDA can place one or more of our clinical trials on hold. If safety concerns develop, we may, or the FDA or an institutional review board may require us to, stop the affected trials before completion.\nThe completion of our clinical trials also may be delayed or terminated for a number of other reasons, including if:\n \u25cf third-party clinical investigators do not perform the clinical trials on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices required by the FDA and other regulatory requirements, or other third parties do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner; \u25cf inspections of clinical trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities reveal violations that require us to undertake corrective action, suspend or terminate one or more sites, or prohibit use of some or all of the data in support of marketing applications; or \u25cf the FDA or one or more institutional review boards suspends or terminates the trial at an investigational site, or precludes enrollment of additional subjects. \nOur development costs will increase if there are material delays in our clinical trials, or if we are required to modify, suspend, terminate or repeat a clinical trial. If we are unable to conduct our clinical trials properly, we may never receive regulatory approval to market our product candidates.\nHealth care companies have been the subjects of federal and state investigations, and we could become subject to investigations in the future.\nBoth federal and state government agencies have heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. There are numerous ongoing investigations of health care companies, as well as their executives and managers. In addition, amendments to the federal FCA, including under healthcare reform legislation, have made it easier for private parties to bring qui tam\u201d (or whistleblower) lawsuits against companies under which the whistleblower may be entitled to receive a percentage of any money paid to the government. The FCA provides, in part, that an action can be brought against any person or entity that has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. The government has taken the position that claims presented in violation of the federal AKS, Stark Law or other healthcare-related laws, including laws enforced by the FDA, may be considered a violation of the FCA. Penalties include substantial fines for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person or entity and/or exclusion from the Medicare program. In addition, a majority of states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions.\nWe are not aware of any government investigations involving any of our facilities or management. While we believe that we are in compliance with applicable governmental healthcare laws and regulations, any future investigations of our business or executives could cause us to incur substantial costs, and result in significant liabilities or penalties, as well as damage to our reputation.\n 54 \n \nIt is uncertain to what extent the government, private health insurers and third-party payors will approve coverage or provide reimbursement for the therapies and products to which our services relate. Availability for such reimbursement may be further limited by reductions in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare program funding in the United States.\nTo the extent that health care providers cannot obtain coverage or reimbursement for our products and therapies, they may elect not to provide such products and therapies to their patients and, thus, may not need our services. Further, as cost containment pressures are increasing in the health care industry, government and private payors may adopt strategies designed to limit the amount of reimbursement paid to health care providers.\nSimilarly, the trend toward managed health care and bundled pricing for health care services in the United States, could significantly influence the purchase of healthcare products and services, resulting in lower prices and reduced demand for our therapeutic products under development.\nWe may directly or indirectly receive revenues from federal health care programs, such as Medicare. Federal health care programs are subject to changes in coverage and reimbursement rules and procedures, including retroactive rate adjustments. These contingencies could materially decrease the range of services covered by such programs or the reimbursement rates paid directly or indirectly for our products and services. To the extent that any health care reform favors the reimbursement of other therapies over our therapeutic products under development, such reform could affect our ability to sell our services, which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nThe limitation on reimbursement available from private and government payors may reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Additional legislation or regulation relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future which could adversely affect the revenues generated from the sale of our products and services.\nFurthermore, there has been a trend in recent years towards reductions in overall funding for Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. There has also been an increase in the number of people who are not eligible for or enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. The reduced funding of governmental programs could have a negative impact on the demand for our services to the extent it relates to products and services which are reimbursed by government and private payors.\nUnintended consequences of healthcare reform in the United States may adversely affect our business.\nThe healthcare industry is undergoing fundamental changes resulting from political, economic and regulatory influences. In the United States, the PPACA was signed into law in 2010 under the Obama administration. By implementing comprehensive reforms, the law seeks to, among other things, increase access to healthcare for the uninsured and control the escalation of healthcare expenditures within the economy. While we do not believe this law will have a direct impact on our business, the law requires the adoption of various implementing regulations, which may have unintended consequences or indirectly impact our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In the past two years, Congress has considered additional reductions in Medicare reimbursement for drugs and devices as part of legislation to reduce the budget deficit. Similar legislation could be enacted in the future. The Medicare regulations and interpretive determinations that determine how drugs, devices and services are covered and reimbursed also are subject to change. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could impact our business.\nHealthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and decreased reimbursement. Under the Trump administration, Congress passed certain legislation to alter the PPACA. In addition, Congress and select states have proposed legislation to alter and/or repeal the PPACA and/or transform certain aspects of existing federal and state health programs. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates. It is difficult to predict how enforcement initiatives under the PPACA and/or additional legislation or regulation enacted in the future may impact our business. If the PPACA and/or additional legislation or regulation enacted in the future cause such unintended consequences or indirect impact, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n 55 \n \nCompetitor companies or hospitals in the EU may be able to take advantage of EU rules permitting sales of unlicensed medicines for individual patients to sell competing products without a marketing authorization.\nThe EU medicines rules allow individual member states to permit the supply of a medicinal product without a marketing authorization to fulfill special needs, where the product is supplied in response to a bona fide unsolicited order, formulated in accordance with the specifications of a healthcare professional and for use by an individual patient under his direct personal responsibility. This may, in certain countries, also apply to products manufactured in a country outside the EU and imported to treat specific patients or small groups of patients. In addition, advanced therapy medicinal products do not need a marketing authorization if they are prepared on a non-routine basis and are used within the same EU member state in a hospital in accordance with a medical prescription for an individual patient.\nThese exemptions could allow our competitors to make sales in the EU without having obtained a marketing authorization and without undergoing the expense of clinical trials, especially if those competitors have cell processing facilities in the relevant EU member state. Similarly, certain hospitals may be able to compete with us on the basis of these rules.\nRisks Related to and Our Common Stock\nWe pay no dividends.\nWe have never paid cash dividends in the past, and currently do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThere is at present only a limited market for our common stock, and there is no assurance that an active trading market for our securities will develop.\nThe market for our common stock is limited. No assurance can be given that an active market for our shares will develop or, if developed, will be sustained. In addition, although there have been market makers in our common stock, we cannot assure that these market makers will continue to make a market in our securities or that other factors outside of our control will not cause them to stop market making in our securities. Making a market in securities involves maintaining bid and ask quotations and being able to effect transactions in reasonable quantities at those quoted prices, subject to various securities laws and other regulatory requirements. Furthermore, the development and maintenance of a public trading market depends upon the existence of willing buyers and sellers, the presence of which is not within our control or that of any market maker. Market makers are not required to maintain a continuous two-sided market, are required to honor firm quotations for only a limited number of securities, and are free to withdraw firm quotations at any time. Even with a market maker, factors such as our past losses from operations and the small size of our company mean that there can be no assurance of an active and liquid market for our securities developing in the foreseeable future. Even if a market develops, we cannot assure that a market will continue, or that stockholders will be able to resell their securities at any price.\nStockholders who hold unregistered shares of our common stock are subject to resale restrictions pursuant to Rule 144 due to our former status as a shell company.\u201d\nWe previously were a shell company\u201d pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act ( Rule 144\u201d), and, as such, sales of our securities pursuant to Rule 144 cannot be made unless, among other things, we continue to remain subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and we file all of our required periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Because our unregistered securities cannot be sold pursuant to Rule 144 unless we continue to meet such requirements, any unregistered securities we sell in the future or issue to consultants or employees, in consideration for services rendered or for any other purpose, will have no liquidity unless we continue to comply with such requirements. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to obtain financing to fund our operations and pay our consultants and employees with our securities instead of cash.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, increased costs as a result of being an SEC reporting company.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as a variety of related rules implemented by the SEC, have required changes in corporate governance practices and generally increased the disclosure requirements of public companies. As a reporting company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses in connection with our public disclosure and other obligations. Based upon SEC regulations currently in effect, we are required to establish, evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. We believe that compliance with the myriad of rules and regulations applicable to reporting companies and related compliance issues will continue to require a significant amount of time and attention from our management.\n 56 \n \nOur stock prices may fluctuate significantly and be highly volatile and this may make it difficult for a stockholder to resell our securities at the volume, prices and times the stockholder finds attractive.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations and be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for a stockholder to resell our securities at the volume, prices and times the stockholder finds attractive. There are many factors that will impact our stock price and trading volume, including, but not limited to, the factors listed above under Risks Related to Our Business Generally,\u201d Risks Related to Our Cell Therapy Product Development Efforts,\u201d Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property,\u201d Risks Related to Government Regulation\u201d and Risks Related to Our Common Stock\u201d.\nStock markets, in general, experience significant price and volume volatility, and the market price of our securities may continue to be subject to such market fluctuations that may be unrelated to our operating performance and prospects. Increased market volatility and fluctuations could result in a substantial decline in the market price of our securities.\nThere may be significant future issuances or resales of our common stock which may materially and adversely dilute stockholders' ownership interest and affect the market price of our securities.\nWe have authorization to issue up to 300,000,000,000 shares of common stock of which, as of March 17, 2021, 3,016,743,991 shares are issued and outstanding. We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock in the future, including securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, we issued warrants for the purchase of an aggregate of 15,226,203,720 shares of our common stock. In addition, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, we issued convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $9,642,418. Such notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at prices related to the market price of our common stock at the time of conversion. Our issuance of additional shares of common stock in the future will dilute the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders.\nPursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, an aggregate of 1,049,726,797 shares of common stock were issued to holders of unsecured claims. Such shares are freely tradeable in the public market, except for shares held by affiliates.\nWe have effective registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act registering an aggregate of 19,955,000 shares of our common stock issuable under our 2010 Equity Participation Plan (the Plan\u201d). As of March 17, 2021, options to purchase 4,879,617 shares of our common stock were outstanding under the Plan. In addition, as of such date, 45,000 shares of common stock were issued as stock grants pursuant to the Plan. The Plan terminated on November 17, 2020 and accordingly no further grants may be made under the Plan. The shares issuable pursuant to the registration statements on Form S-8 will be freely tradable in the public market, except for shares held by affiliates.\nThe sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock, whether directly by us in future offerings or by our existing stockholders in the secondary market, the perception that such issuances or resales could occur or the availability for future issuances or resale of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock could materially and adversely affect the market price of our securities and our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities on attractive terms or at all.\nIn addition, our Board of Directors is authorized to designate and issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval, and we may issue other equity and equity-related securities that are senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, to support operations and growth, and to comply with any future changes in regulatory standards.\n 57 \n \nAnti-takeover provisions and the regulations to which we may be subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to our securityholders.\nWe are incorporated in Delaware. Anti-takeover provisions in Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their securities. Our certificate of incorporation provides that our Board of Directors may issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, without stockholder approval and with such terms, preferences, rights and privileges as the Board of Directors may deem appropriate. These provisions and other factors may hinder or prevent a change in control, even if the change in control would be perceived as beneficial to, or sought by, our other stockholders.\nWe have not filed all periodic reports required to be filed with the SEC; we believe that such failure is making our common stock less difficult to sell.\nWe have not filed our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 or September 30, 2020. We believe that such lack of current public information is making our common stock more difficult to sell.\nOur common stock is classified as a penny stock;\u201d the restrictions of the penny stock regulations of the SEC may result in less liquidity for our common stock.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which define a penny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as therein defined) of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock by a retail customer, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about commissions payable to both the broker/dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Our common stock is classified as a penny stock. As a result of the penny stock restrictions, brokers or potential investors may be reluctant to trade in our securities, which may result in less liquidity for our securities.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nShares of our common stock that we have issued or are issuable upon the exercise of warrants or upon the conversion of convertible debt may be covered by registration statements which permit the public sale of stock. Other holders of shares of common stock that we have issued, including shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants and the conversion of convertible debt, may be entitled to dispose of their shares subject to the requirements of Rule 144 or other applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, the shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the conversion of convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $3,644,279 are subject to certain lock-up restrictions over the 180 day period following the November 16, 2020 effective date of the Plan of Reorganization. As those lock-up restrictions expire during said 180 day period, the shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the conversion of such notes will become eligible for resale in the open market (subject to Rule 144 volume limitations applicable to affiliates), resulting in more shares eligible for sale and potentially causing sales in the market to increase and our stock price to decline. In addition, effective February 17, 2021, certain lock-up restrictions imposed by the Plan of Reorganization with regard to the resale of the 1,049,726,797 shares of common stock issued to holders of unsecured claims expired. The unrestricted eligibility of such shares for resale in the open market (subject to Rule 144 volume limitations applicable to affiliates) could also have a negative effect upon our stock price. Additional sales of a substantial number of our shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our stock.\n ", "item_7_text": "Item 7 of this Annual Report ( Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition - Risks Related to Our Cell Therapy Product Development Efforts; and - Risks Related to Government Regulation.\u201d). The FDA review and approval process can be lengthy, expensive and uncertain and there is no guarantee of ultimate approval or clearance.\nLaboratory\nWe have established a laboratory in Melville, New York for research purposes and have built a cleanroom within the laboratory for the possible production of cell-based product candidates, such as BRTX-100, for use in a clinical trial, for third party cell products or general research purposes.\nAs operations grow, our plans include the expansion of our laboratory to perform cellular characterization and culturing, protocol and stem cell-related IP development, translational research and therapeutic outcome analysis. As we develop our business and our stem cell product candidates and obtain regulatory approval, we will seek to establish ourselves as a key provider of adult stem cells for therapies and expand to provide cells in other market areas for stem cell therapy. We may also use outside laboratories specializing in cell therapy services and manufacturing of cell products.\n 15 \n \nTechnology; Research and Development\nWe intend to utilize our laboratory or a third party laboratory in connection with cellular research activities. We also intend to obtain cellular-based therapeutic technology licenses and increase our IP portfolio. We intend to seek to develop potential stem cell delivery systems or devices. The goal of these specialized delivery systems or devices is to deliver cells into specific areas of the body, control the rate, amount and types of cells used in a treatment, and populate these areas of the body with sufficient stem cells so that there is a successful therapeutic result.\nWe also intend to perform research to develop certain stem cell optimization compounds, media designed to enhance cellular growth and regeneration for the purpose of improving pre-treatment and post-treatment outcomes.\nIn our Disc/Spine Program, two patent applications have been filed with regard to technology that is the subject of the Regenerative License Agreement (see Disc/Spine Program-License\u201d above). Regenerative has been issued a patent from one of these applications with regard to its curved needle therapeutic delivery device. The other application remains pending. The patents that are the subject of the Regenerative License Agreement have been assigned to Regenexx, LLC which we have been advised is an affiliate of Regenerative.\nIn our ThermoStem Program, we have three pending United States patent applications and four United States patents within three patent families. With regards to the first patent family in the ThermoStem Program, patent applications have been filed in five foreign jurisdictions (of which four applications have been granted as foreign patents and one application, which is not listed in the table below, has lapsed). With regards to the second patent family in the ThermoStem Program, patent applications have been filed in four foreign jurisdictions (of which three applications have been granted as foreign patents). With regards to the third patent family in the ThermoStem Program, a U.S. application and PCT application have been filed.\nOur patent applications and those of Regenexx, LLC are currently in prosecution (i.e., we and Regenexx, LLC are seeking issued patents). A description of the active patent applications and issued patents is set forth in the table below:\n\n*Patent application filed by licensor assignee, Regenexx, LLC\n**Patent issued to licensor assignee, Regenexx, LLC\n***Application has been allowed, but not yet issued as a US patent.\n 16 \n \nIn March 2014, we entered into a Research and Development Agreement with Rohto Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a Japanese pharmaceutical company ( Rohto\u201d). Pursuant to the Research and Development Agreement with Rohto, we were engaged to provide research and development services with regard to stem cells.\nIn March 2014, we entered into the Research Agreement with Pfizer, as discussed above under Metabolic Brown Adipose (Fat) Program.\u201d\nWe have secured registrations in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the following trademarks:\n\nWe own a published application in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the trademark BRTX. The Dragonfly Logo is also registered with the U.S. Copyright Office.\nWe also have federal common law rights in the trademark BioRestorative Therapies and other trademarks and trade names used in the conduct of our business that are not registered.\nOur success will depend in large part on our ability to develop and protect our proprietary technology. We intend to rely on a combination of patent, trade secret and know-how, copyright and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, licensing agreements, non-compete agreements and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Our success will also depend upon our ability to avoid infringing upon the proprietary rights of others, for if we are judicially determined to have infringed such rights, we may be required to pay damages, alter our services, products or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred $1,722,338 and $1,513,150, respectively, in research and development expenses.\nScientific Advisors\nWe have established a Scientific Advisory Board whose purpose is to provide advice and guidance in connection with scientific matters relating to our business. The Scientific Advisory Board has established a Disc Advisory Committee which focuses on matters relating to our Disc/Spine Program. Our Scientific Advisory Board members are Dr. Wayne Marasco (Chairman), Dr. Naiyer Imam, Dr. Wayne Olan, Dr. Joy Cavagnaro, Dr. Jason Lipetz, Dr. Harvinder Sandhu, Dr. Christopher Plastaras and Dr. Gerard A. Malanga. The Disc Advisory Committee members are Dr. Lipetz (Chairman), Dr. Olan, Dr. Sandhu, Dr. Plastaras and Dr. Malanga. See Item 10 ( Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance-Scientific Advisors\u201d) for a listing of the principal positions for Drs. Marasco, Imam, Olan, Cavagnaro, Lipetz, Sandhu, Plastaras and Malanga.\n 17 \n \nCompetition\nWe will compete with many pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies, as well as other private and public stem cell companies involved in the development and commercialization of cell-based medical technologies and therapies.\nRegenerative medicine is rapidly progressing, in large part through the development of cell-based therapies or devices designed to isolate cells from human tissues. Most efforts involve cell sources, such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, embryonic and fetal tissue, umbilical cord and peripheral blood and skeletal muscle.\nCompanies working in the area of regenerative medicine with regard to the disc and spine include, among others, Mesoblast, SpinalCyte, DiscGenics and Isto Biologics. Companies that are developing products and therapies to combat obesity and diabetes, including through the use of brown fat, include, among others, Novo Nordisk, Sanofi, Merck, Eli Lilly, Roche, Pfizer and Regeneron.\nMany of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing and personnel resources than we do. We cannot, with any accuracy, forecast when or if these companies are likely to bring their products and therapies to market in competition with those that we are pursuing.\nWith the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA\u201d), an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products was created. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and the proposed biosimilar product. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product, and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years following approval of the reference product, and it may not be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product is approved under a biologics license application ( BLA\u201d).\nWe believe that, if any of our product candidates are approved as a biological product under a BLA, it should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that the FDA could permit biosimilar applicants to reference approved biologics other than our therapeutic candidates, thus circumventing our exclusivity and potentially creating the opportunity for competition sooner than anticipated. Additionally, this period of regulatory exclusivity does not apply to companies pursuing regulatory approval via their own traditional BLA, rather than via the abbreviated pathway. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\n 18 \n \nSet forth below is a comparison of BRTX-100 to Mesoblast's adult stem cell biologic:\nWe believe that BRTX-100 has competitive advantages to Mesoblast's product for the following reasons:\n\nCustomers\nUpon regulatory approval, our cell product candidates are intended to be marketed to physicians, other health care professionals, hospitals, research institutions, pharmaceutical companies and the military. It is anticipated that physicians who are trained and skilled in performing spinal injections will be the physicians most likely to treat discs with injections of BRTX-100 upon regulatory approval. These physicians would include interventional physiatrists (physical medicine physicians), pain management anesthesiologists, interventional radiologists and neurosurgeons.\nGovernmental Regulation\nU.S. Government Regulation\nThe health care industry is highly regulated in the United States. The federal government, through various departments and agencies, state and local governments, and private third-party accreditation organizations, regulate and monitor the health care industry, associated products, and operations. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, manufacture, distribution and marketing of medical products, including drugs, biologics, and medical devices. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, post-approval monitoring, advertising, promotion, sampling and import and export of medical products. The following is a general overview of the laws and regulations pertaining to our business.\n 19 \n \nFDA Regulation of Stem Cell Treatment and Products\nThe FDA regulates the manufacture of human stem cell treatments and associated products under the authority of the Public Health Service Act ( PHSA\u201d) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( FDCA\u201d). Stem cells can be regulated under the FDA's Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products Regulations ( HCT/Ps\u201d) or may also be subject to the FDA's drug, biologic, or medical device regulations, each as discussed below.\nHuman Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products Regulation\nUnder Section 361 of the PHSA, the FDA issued specific regulations governing the use of HCT/Ps in humans. Pursuant to Part 1271 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR\u201d) (the HCT/P Regulations\u201d), the FDA established a unified registration and listing system for establishments that manufacture and process HCT/Ps. The regulations also include provisions pertaining to donor eligibility determinations; current good tissue practices covering all stages of production, including harvesting, processing, manufacture, storage, labeling, packaging, and distribution; and other procedures to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases.\nThe HCT/P Regulations define HCT/Ps as articles containing or consisting of human cells or tissues that are intended for implantation, transplantation, infusion or transfer into a human recipient.\u201d The HCT/P Regulations strictly constrain the types of products that may be regulated solely as HCT/P. Factors considered include the degree of manipulation, whether the product is intended for a homologous function, whether the product has been combined with noncellular or non-tissue components, and the product's effect or dependence on the body's metabolic function. In those instances where cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products have been only minimally manipulated, are intended strictly for homologous use, have not been combined with noncellular or nontissue substances, and do not depend on or have any effect on the body's metabolism, the manufacturer is only required to register with the FDA, submit a list of manufactured products, and adopt and implement procedures for the control of communicable diseases. If one or more of the above factors has been exceeded, the product would be regulated as a drug, biological product, or medical device rather than an HCT/P.\nBecause we are an enterprise in the early stages of operations and have not generated significant revenues from operations, it is difficult to anticipate the likely regulatory status of the array of products and services that we may offer. We believe that some of the adult autologous (self derived) stem cells that will be used in our cellular therapy products and services, including the brown adipose (fat) tissue that we intend to use in our ThermoStem Program, may be regulated by the FDA as HCT/Ps under the HCT/P Regulations. However, the FDA may disagree with this position or conclude that some or all of our stem cell therapy products or services do not meet the applicable definitions and exemptions to the regulation. In July, 2020, the FDA issued an updated guidance document entitled Regulatory Considerations for Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products: Minimal Manipulation and Homologous Use\u201d that provides additional guidance on how FDA interprets the HCT/P Regulations, particularly the definition of the terms minimally manipulated\u201d and homologous use.\u201d In the guidance, FDA stated it will exercise enforcement discretion until May 31, 2021 for products that do not comply with the HCT/P Regulations. After that date, manufacturers of products marketed as HCT/Ps that do not comply with the HCT/P Regulations will be subject to immediate FDA enforcement action. If we are not regulated solely under the HCT/P Regulations, we would need to expend significant resources to comply with the FDA's broad regulatory authority under the FDCA. Third party litigation concerning the autologous use of a stem cell mixture to treat musculoskeletal and spinal injuries has increased the likelihood that some of our products and services are likely to be regulated as a drug or biological product and require FDA approval. In past litigation, the FDA asserted that the defendants' use of cultured stem cells without FDA approval is in violation of the FDCA, claiming that the defendants' product is a drug. The defendants asserted that their procedure is part of the practice of medicine and therefore beyond the FDA's regulatory authority. The District Court ruled in favor of the FDA, and in February 2014 the Circuit Court affirmed the District Court's holding.\nIf regulated solely under the FDA's HCT/P statutory and regulatory provisions, once our laboratory in the United States becomes operational, it will need to satisfy the following requirements, among others, to process and store stem cells:\n\n 20 \n \n\nNon-reproductive HCT/Ps and non-peripheral blood stem/progenitor cells that are offered for import into the United States and regulated solely under Section 361 of the PHSA must also satisfy the requirements under 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1271.420. Section 1271.420 requires that the importer of record of HCT/Ps notify the FDA prior to, or at the time of, importation and provide sufficient information for the FDA to make an admissibility decision. In addition, the importer must hold the HCT/P intact and under conditions necessary to prevent transmission of communicable disease until an admissibility decision is made by the FDA.\nIf the FDA determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions including public warning letters, fines, consent decrees, orders of retention, recall or destruction of product, orders to cease manufacturing, and criminal prosecution. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect us.\nTo the extent that our cellular therapy activities are limited to developing products and services outside the United States, as described in detail below, the products and services would not be subject to FDA regulation, but will be subject to the applicable requirements of the foreign jurisdiction. We intend to comply with all applicable foreign governmental requirements.\nDrug and Biological Product Regulation\nAn HCT/P product that does not meet the criteria for being solely regulated under Section 361 of the PHSA will be regulated as a drug, device or biological product under the FDCA and/or Section 351 of the PHSA, and applicable FDA regulations. The FDA has broad regulatory authority over drugs and biologics marketed for sale in the United States. The FDA regulates the research, clinical testing, manufacturing, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, distribution, and production of drugs and biological products. The FDA also regulates the export of drugs and biological products manufactured in the United States to international markets in certain situations.\nThe process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:\n\u25cf completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practice ( GLP\u201d) or other applicable regulations;\n\u25cf submission of an IND, which allows clinical trials to begin unless the FDA objects within 30 days;\n\u25cf performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biologic for its intended use or uses conducted in accordance with FDA regulations and Good Clinical Practices ( GCP\u201d), which are international ethical and scientific quality standards meant to ensure that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected and that the integrity of the data is maintained;\n\u25cf registration of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products and certain clinical trial information;\n\u25cf preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application ( NDA\u201d), in the case of a drug or BLA in the case of a biologic;\n\u25cf review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;\n 21 \n \n\u25cf satisfactory completion of pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements and of selected clinical trial sites to assess compliance with GCP requirements; and\n\u25cf FDA approval of an NDA or BLA which must occur before a drug or biologic can be marketed or sold.\nApproval of an NDA requires a showing that the drug is safe and effective for its intended use and that the methods, facilities, and controls used for the manufacturing, processing, and packaging of the drug are adequate to preserve its identity, strength, quality, and purity. To obtain a BLA, a manufacturer must show that the proposed product is safe, pure, and potent and that the facility in which the product is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets established quality control standards.\nFor purposes of an NDA or BLA approval by the FDA, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following phases (which may overlap):\n\u25cf Phase 1: The investigational product is initially given to healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. These trials may also provide early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational product's pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.\n\u25cf Phase 2: These clinical trials are conducted in a limited number of human subjects in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the investigational product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and dosage levels. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials.\n\u25cf Phase 3: Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken after Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dosage range of the investigational product appears effective and has a tolerable safety profile. The Phase 2 clinical trials must also provide sufficient information for the design of Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety risks in an expanded human subject population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to further evaluate dosage, effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk profile of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling and approval by the FDA. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of an investigational drug or biologic.\nAll clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations, GCP requirements and their protocols in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. These government regulations may delay or prevent approval of product candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our business operations.\nThe FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials, referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, after a product is approved. Such trials may be made a condition to be satisfied for continuing drug approval. The results of Phase 4 clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. In addition, the FDA has authority to require sponsors to conduct post-marketing trials to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency.\n 22 \n \nUnder the Pediatric Research Equity Act ( PREA\u201d), certain NDAs and BLAs and certain supplements to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act ( FDASIA\u201d) amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan ( PSP\u201d) within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.\nChanges to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA, or an NDA or BLA supplement, before the change can be implemented. An NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA and BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs and BLAs.\nDrug and biological products must also comply with applicable requirements, including monitoring and recordkeeping activities, manufacturing requirements, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug's approved labeling, or off-label use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may, in their independent professional medical judgment, prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers typically may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling, or changes of the site of manufacture, are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, who may or may not grant approval or may include a lengthy review process.\nIn the event that the FDA does not regulate our product candidates in the United States solely under the HCT/P regulation, our products and activities could be regulated as drug or biological products under the FDCA. If regulated as drug or biological products, we will need to expend significant resources to ensure regulatory compliance. If an IND and NDA or BLA are required for any of our product candidates, there is no assurance as to whether or when we will receive FDA approval of the product candidate. The process of designing, conducting, compiling and submitting the non-clinical and clinical studies required for NDA or BLA approval is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable. The process can take many years, depending on the product and the FDA's requirements.\nIn addition, even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution or use, or post-marketing trial requirements. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, including safety labeling or imposition of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS\u201d), the requirement to conduct post-market studies or clinical trials or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval for our products, or obtaining approval but for significantly limited use, would harm our business. Further, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future United States or foreign governmental action.\nIf the FDA determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions from public warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals, seizure of our products, total or partial shutdown of our production, withdrawal of approvals, and criminal prosecutions. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect us.\n 23 \n \nFDA Expedited Review Programs\nThe FDA is authorized to expedite the review of NDAs and BLAs in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Drug and biologic products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied.\nIn addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track NDA or BLA before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review.\nAny product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may also be eligible for the following other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review:\n\u25cf Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review, and rolling review.\n\u25cf Priority review. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, it would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition compared to marketed products. The FDA aims to complete its review of priority review applications within six months as opposed to ten months for standard review.\n\u25cf Accelerated approval. Drug or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials.\nFast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.\nFurther, with the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act (the Cures Act\u201d) in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine advanced therapy ( RMAT\u201d) (which may include a cell therapy) that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a RMAT designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.\nMedical Device Regulation\nThe FDA also has broad authority over the regulation of medical devices marketed for sale in the United States. The FDA regulates the research, clinical testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, promotion, distribution, and production of medical devices. The FDA also regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the United States to international markets.\nUnder the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes, Class I, Class II, or Class III, depending upon the degree of risk associated with the medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are subject to the lowest degree of regulatory scrutiny because they are considered low risk devices and need only comply with the FDA's General Controls. The General Controls include compliance with the registration, listing, adverse event reporting requirements, and applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation as well as the general misbranding and adulteration prohibitions.\n 24 \n \nClass II devices are subject to the General Controls as well as certain Special Controls such as 510(k) premarket notification. Class III devices are subject to the highest degree of regulatory scrutiny and typically include life supporting and life sustaining devices and implants. They are subject to the General Controls and Special Controls that include a premarket approval application ( PMA\u201d). New\u201d devices are automatically regulated as Class III devices unless they are shown to be low risk, in which case they may be subject to de novo review to be moved to Class I or Class II. Clinical research of an investigational device is subject to the FDA's Investigational Device Exemption ( IDE\u201d) regulations. Nonsignificant risk devices are subject to abbreviated requirements that do not require a submission to the FDA but must have Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and comply with other requirements pertaining to informed consent, labeling, recordkeeping, reporting, and monitoring. Significant risk devices require the submission of an IDE application to the FDA and the FDA's approval of the IDE application.\nThe FDA premarket clearance and approval process can be lengthy, expensive and uncertain. It generally takes three to twelve months from submission to obtain 510(k) premarket clearance, although it may take longer. Approval of a PMA could take one to four years, or more, from the time the application is submitted and there is no guarantee of ultimate clearance or approval. Securing FDA clearances and approvals may require the submission of extensive clinical data and supporting information to the FDA. Additionally, the FDA actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing and promotion of devices for indications or uses that have not been cleared or approved by the FDA. In addition, modifications or enhancements of products that could affect the safety or effectiveness or effect a major change in the intended use of a device that was either cleared through the 510(k) process or approved through the PMA process may require further FDA review through new 510(k) or PMA submissions.\nIn the event we develop processes, products or services which qualify as medical devices subject to FDA regulation, we intend to comply with such regulations. If the FDA determines that our products are regulated as medical devices and we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions from public warning letters, application integrity proceedings, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals, seizure of our products, total or partial shutdown of our production, withdrawal of approvals, and criminal prosecutions. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect us.\nCurrent Good Manufacturing Practices and other FDA Regulations of Cellular Therapy Products\nProducts that fall outside of the HCT/P regulations and are regulated as drugs, biological products, or devices must comply with applicable cGMP regulations. These cGMPs and related quality standards are designed to ensure the products that are processed at a facility meet the FDA's applicable requirements for identity, strength, quality, sterility, purity, and safety. In the event that our domestic United States operations are subject to the FDA's drug, biological product, or device regulations, we intend to comply with the applicable cGMPs and quality regulations.\nIf the FDA determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions from public warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals, seizure of our products, total or partial shutdown of our production, withdrawal of approvals, and criminal prosecutions. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect us.\nPromotion of Foreign-Based Cellular Therapy Treatment- Medical Tourism\u201d\nWe may establish, or license technology to third parties in connection with their establishment of, adult stem cell therapy facilities outside the United States. We also intend to work with hospitals and physicians to make the stem cell-based therapies available for patients who travel outside the United States for treatment. Medical tourism\u201d is defined as the practice of traveling across international borders to obtain health care.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (the FTC\u201d) has the authority to regulate and police advertising of medical treatments, procedures, and regimens in the United States under the Federal Trade Commission Act, or the FTCA. The FTC has regulatory authority to prevent unfair and deceptive practices and false advertising. Specifically, the FTC requires advertisers and promoters to have a reasonable basis to substantiate and support claims. The FTC has many enforcement powers, one of which is the power to order disgorgement by promoters deemed in violation of the FTCA of any profits made from the promoted business and can order injunctions from further violative promotion. Advertising that we may utilize in connection with our medical tourism operations will be subject to FTC regulatory authority, and we intend to comply with such regulatory r\u00e9gime. Similar laws and requirements are likely to exist in other countries and we intend to comply with such requirements.\n 25 \n \nFederal Regulation of Clinical Laboratories\nCongress passed the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, in 1988, which provided the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d) authority over all laboratory testing, except research, that is performed on humans in the United States. The Division of Laboratory Services, within the Survey and Certification Group, under the Center for Medicaid and State Operations ( CMSO\u201d) has the responsibility for implementing the CLIA program.\nThe CLIA program is designed to establish quality laboratory testing by ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of patient test results. Under CLIA, a laboratory is a facility that does laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans and used to provide information for the diagnosis, prevention, treatment of disease, or impairment of, or assessment of health. Laboratories that handle stem cells and other biologic matter are, therefore, included under the CLIA program. Under the CLIA program, laboratories must be certified by the government, satisfy governmental quality and personnel standards, undergo proficiency testing, be subject to inspections, and pay fees. To the extent that our business activities require CLIA certification, we intend to obtain and maintain such certification. If we are subject to CLIA, the failure to comply with CLIA standards could result in suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory's CLIA certificate. In addition, fines or criminal penalties could also be levied. If any of these events were to occur, it could impact our business operations.\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-Protection of Patient Health Information\nWe may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA\u201d), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ( HITECH\u201d) and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on certain types of individuals and organizations. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other and from HIPAA in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Further, we may need to also comply with additional federal or state privacy laws and regulations that may apply to certain diagnoses, such as HIV/AIDS, to the extent that they apply to us.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS\u201d), through its Office for Civil Rights, investigates breach reports and determines whether administrative or technical modifications are required and whether civil or criminal sanctions should be imposed. Companies failing to comply with HIPAA and the implementing regulations may also be subject to civil money penalties or in the case of knowing violations, potential criminal penalties, including monetary fines, imprisonment, or both. In some cases, the State Attorneys General may seek enforcement and appropriate sanctions in federal court.\nOther Applicable U.S. Laws\nIn addition to the above-described regulation by United States federal and state government, the following are other federal and state laws and regulations that could directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate the business:\n\n 26 \n \n\nViolation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations may result in penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment. Furthermore, efforts to ensure that business activities and business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can be costly for manufacturers of branded prescription products.\nForeign Government Regulation\nIn general, we will need to comply with the government regulations of each individual country in which our therapy centers are located and products are to be distributed and sold. These regulations vary in complexity and can be as stringent, and on occasion even more stringent, than FDA regulations in the United States. Due to the fact that there are new and emerging cell therapy regulations that have recently been drafted and/or implemented in various countries around the world, the application and subsequent implementation of these new and emerging regulations have little to no precedence. Therefore, the level of complexity and stringency is not always precisely understood for each country, creating greater uncertainty for the international regulatory process. Furthermore, government regulations can change with little to no notice and may result in up-regulation of our product(s), thereby creating a greater regulatory burden for our cell processing technology products. We have not yet thoroughly explored the applicable laws and regulations that we will need to comply with in foreign jurisdictions. It is possible that we may not be permitted to expand our business into one or more foreign jurisdictions.\n 27 \n \nWe do not have any definitive plans or arrangements with respect to the establishment by us of stem cell therapy clinics in any country. We intend to explore any such opportunities as they arise.\nOffices\nOur principal executive offices are located at 40 Marcus Drive, Suite One, Melville, New York, and our telephone number is (631) 760-8100. Our website is www.biorestorative.com. Our internet website and the information contained therein or connected thereto are not intended to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.\nEmployees\nWe currently have six employees, all of whom are full-time employees. We believe that our employee relations are good.\n\nNot applicable. See, however, Item 7 ( Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition\u201d).\n\nNot applicable.\n\nOur principal executive offices and laboratory are located at 40 Marcus Drive, Suite One, Melville, New York. We occupy 6,800 square feet of space at the premises pursuant to a lease that expires in December 2024. The lease provides for an annual base rental during the five year period ending in December 2024 ranging between $153,748 and $173,060.

Any over-the-counter market quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission, and may not necessarily represent actual transactions.\nHolders\nAs of March 17, 2021, there were 370 record holders of our shares of common stock.\nDividends\nNot applicable.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2019, we issued the following securities in transactions not involving any public offering. For each of the following transactions, we relied upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d), as transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering or Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act as a security exchanged by an issuer with its existing security holders exclusively where no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting such exchange. For each such transaction, we did not use general solicitation or advertising to market the securities, the securities were offered to a limited number of persons, the investors had access to information regarding us (including information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019 and Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and press releases made by us), and we were available to answer questions by prospective investors. We reasonably believe that each of the investors is an accredited investor. The proceeds were used to reduce our working capital deficiency and for other corporate purposes.\n 29 \n \n\n\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2019, there were no purchases of common stock made by us or any affiliated purchaser\u201d.\n\nNot applicable.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. \nThe following discussion and analysis of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of BioRestorative Therapies, Inc. and its subsidiary as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report following Item 16 ( Form 10-K Summary\u201d).

We are currently pursuing our Disc/Spine Program with our initial investigational therapeutic product being called BRTX-100. We submitted an IND application to the FDA to obtain authorization to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial investigating the use of BRTX-100, our lead cell therapy candidate, in the treatment of chronic lower back pain arising from degenerative disc disease. We have received such authorization from the FDA. We intend to commence such clinical trial during the third quarter of 2021 (assuming the receipt of necessary funding). We have obtained a license to use technology for investigational adult stem cell treatment of disc and spine conditions, including protruding and bulging lumbar discs. The technology is an advanced stem cell injection procedure that may offer relief from lower back pain, buttock and leg pain, and numbness and tingling in the leg and foot. We are also developing our ThermoStem Program. This pre-clinical program involves the use of brown adipose (fat) in connection with the cell-based treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity as well as hypertension, other metabolic disorders and cardiac deficiencies. United States patents related to the ThermoStem Program were issued in September 2015, January 2019, and March 2020; a notice of allowance was issued in November 2020 for a United States patent application in the ThermoStem Program and is expected to issue in 2021; Australian patents related to the ThermoStem Program were issued in April 2017 and October 2019; a Japanese patent related to the ThermoStem Program was issued in December 2017; Israeli patents related to the ThermoStem Program were issued in October 2019 and May 2020; and European patents related to the ThermoStem Program were issued in April 2020 and January 2021.\nWe have licensed a patented curved needle device that is a needle system designed to deliver cells and/or other therapeutic products or materials to the spine and discs or other potential sites. We anticipate that FDA approval or clearance will be necessary for this device prior to commercialization. We do not intend to utilize this device in connection with our contemplated Phase 2 clinical trial with regard to BRTX-100.\nOur offices are located in Melville, New York where we have established a laboratory facility in order to increase our capabilities for the further development of possible cellular-based treatments, products and protocols, stem cell-related intellectual property and translational research applications.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our accumulated deficit was $78,570,146, our stockholders' deficit was $12,776,146 and our working capital deficiency was $13,651,716. We have historically only generated a modest amount of revenue, and our losses have principally been operating expenses incurred in research and development, marketing and promotional activities in order to commercialize our products and services, plus costs associated with meeting the requirements of being a public company. We expect to continue to incur substantial costs for these activities over at least the next year.\nBased upon our working capital deficiency as of December 31, 2019, and our forecast for continued operating losses, as of such date, we required equity and/or debt financing to continue our operations. As of December 31, 2019, our outstanding debt of $8,393,327, together with interest at rates ranging between 12% and 15% per annum, was due on various dates through December 18, 2020.\nAs discussed in Item 1 of this Annual Report ( Business - Business Development\u201d), on March 20, 2020, we filed a voluntary petition commencing a case under chapter 11 of title 11 of the U.S. Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York. On October 30, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the plan of reorganization and, on November 16, 2020, the plan became effective. As a result of the confirmed plan of reorganization $14,796,000 in outstanding debt and liabilities were exchanged for (i) shares of common stock, (ii) new convertible debt or (iii) new convertible debt and warrants to purchase common stock.\n 31 \n \nWe anticipate that we will require approximately $12,000,000 in financing to commence and complete a Phase 2 clinical trial with regard to our Disc/Spine Program. We anticipate that we will require approximately $45,000,000 in further additional funding to complete such clinical trials (assuming the receipt of no revenues). We will also require a substantial amount of additional funding if we determine to establish a manufacturing operation with regard to our Disc/Spine Program (as opposed to utilizing a third party manufacturer) and to implement our other programs described in Item 1 of this Annual Report ( Business\u201d), including our metabolic ThermoStem Program, repay our outstanding debt (assuming such debt is not converted into equity) and fund general operations. No assurance can be given that the anticipated amounts of required funding are correct or that we will be able to accomplish our goals within the timeframes projected. In addition, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain any required financing on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise.\nWe are currently seeking several different financing alternatives to support our future operations. The plan of reorganization provides that, at such time as we are current in our periodic SEC filings, subject to certain customary conditions, Auctus Fund, LLC ( Auctus\u201d), which provided debtor-in-possession ( DIP\u201d) financing to us during the reorganization process, is to provide a loan to us, as needed, in an amount equal to $3,500,000 less the sum of the DIP loans previously made by Auctus to us (inclusive of accrued interest, of $1,226,901) and the costs incurred by Auctus as the DIP lender. In addition, Auctus and others provided debt financing in the aggregate principal amount of $3,848,548 at the effective date of our plan of reorganization. If we are unable to obtain such financing on a timely basis or other required financing as needed, we may have to curtail our development, marketing and promotional activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately we could be forced to discontinue our operations and liquidate. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe following table presents selected items in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively:\n\n 32 \n \nRevenues\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we generated $130,000 and $111,000, respectively, of royalty revenue in connection with our sublicense agreement.\nMarketing and promotion\nMarketing and promotion expenses include advertising and promotion, marketing and seminars, meals, entertainment and travel expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, marketing and promotion expenses remained relatively consistent and decreased by $30,924, or 9%, from $352,204 to $321,280 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe expect that marketing and promotion expenses will increase in the future as we increase our marketing activities following full commercialization of our products and services.\nConsulting\nConsulting expenses consist of consulting fees and stock-based compensation to consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2019, consulting expenses remained relatively consistent and increased by $41,854, or 2%, from $1,870,829 to $1,912,683, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses include cash and non-cash compensation of (a) our Vice President of Research and Development; (b) our Scientific Advisory Board members; and (c) laboratory staff and costs related to our brown fat and disc/spine initiatives. Research and development expenses are expensed as they are incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2019, research and development expenses increased by $209,188, or 14%, from $1,513,150 to $1,722,338, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily a result of an increase of approximately $82,067 in stock-based compensation expense primarily related to options issued to our Scientific Advisory Board members, incremental modification expense related to an option repricing in 2019, and an increase in laboratory staffing.\nWe expect that our research and development expenses will increase with the continuation of the aforementioned initiatives.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, payroll taxes, severance costs and stock-based compensation to employees (excluding any cash or non-cash compensation of our Vice President of Research and Development and our laboratory staff), as well as corporate expenses such as legal and professional fees, investor relations and occupancy related expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, general and administrative expenses increased by $583,235, or 15%, from $4,022,469 to $4,605,704, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily due to an increase of approximately $818,000 in professional financial and legal fees related primarily to matters regarding fundings and conversions of debt, as well as an increase in corporate expenses, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $254,000 in stock-based compensation due to fewer outstanding options in 2019.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we expand our staff, develop our infrastructure and incur additional costs to support the growth of our business.\nInterest expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, interest expense increased $535,765, or 57%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was due to an increase in interest-bearing short-term borrowings as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\n 33 \n \nAmortization of debt discount\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, amortization of debt discount increased $1,381,496, or 60%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased issuances of convertible notes and the timing of the recognition of expense related to the bifurcated embedded conversion options of convertible notes.\nLoss on extinguishment of notes payable, net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of notes payable, net, of $1,895,116, as compared to a loss on extinguishment of notes payable, net of $1,415,950 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is associated with debt repayments and debtholders' exchanges of debt into equity securities resulting in a loss on the exchange.\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a gain related to the change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $788,970 due to the decrease in time value of embedded conversion options within certain convertible notes payable, as compared to a loss related to the change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $229,323 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nWe measure our liquidity in a number of ways, including the following:\n\nAvailability of Additional Funds\nBased upon our working capital deficiency and stockholders' deficit of $13,651,716 and $12,776,146, respectively, as of December 31, 2019, as of such date, we required additional equity and/or debt financing to continue our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our outstanding debt of $8,393,327, together with interest at rates ranging between 12% and 15% per annum, was due on various dates through December 18, 2020.\nOur operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including our ability to successfully commercialize our products and services, competing technological and market developments, and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings.\nWe may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it or raise capital on favorable terms. Debt financing may require us to pledge certain assets and enter into covenants that could restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our stockholders or us. If we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms, we may be required to significantly curtail or discontinue operations or obtain funds by entering into financing agreements on unattractive terms.\nOur consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n 34 \n \nThe following has been able to mitigate the above factors with regards to our ability to continue as a going concern: (i) as part of our Chapter 11 reorganization approximately $14,700,000 in outstanding debt and other liabilities were exchanged for (a) shares of common stock, (b) new convertible notes or (c) new convertible notes and warrants to purchase shares of common stock; (ii) we secured DIP financing during our Chapter 11 reorganization in the aggregate amount of $1,189,413, and $3,848,548 in debt financing as part of our Chapter 11 reorganization to sustain operations; (iii) we obtained equity and debt financing in the aggregate amount of $451,762 subsequent to December 31, 2019 and prior to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Case; and (iv) pursuant to the plan of reorganization, Auctus is required to loan to us, as needed and subject to our becoming current in our SEC reporting obligations, an additional amount equal to $3,500,000, less the amount of Auctus' DIP financing ($1,226,901, inclusive of accrued interest) and its DIP costs. As a result of the above, we have sufficient cash to fund operations for the twelve months subsequent to the filing date. In addition, the Company will need to obtain further funding of at least $12,000,000 to commence and complete a Phase 2 clinical study of the use of BRTX-100.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our sources and uses of cash were as follows:\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nWe experienced negative cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 in the amounts of $6,918,734 and $5,104,629, respectively. The net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to cash used to fund a net loss of $14,647,890, adjusted for non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of $7,189,303 partially offset by $539,853 of cash generated by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities, primarily as a result of increases in accrued interest, expenses, and other current liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable. The net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to cash used to fund a net loss of $12,517,803, adjusted for non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of $7,458,950 partially offset by $45,776 of cash generated by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities, primarily as a result of increases in accrued interest, expenses, and other current liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, cash used in investing activities was $35,631 and $12,869, respectively, due to cash used for the purchase of office and computer equipment.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $6,838,505 and $4,783,341, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, $10,888,339 of net proceeds were from debt financings, $1,658,500 of net proceeds were from equity financings, partially offset by $5,708,334 of repayments on debt financings and prepayment premiums. During the year ended December 31, 2018, $4,194,173 of net proceeds were from debt financings and other borrowings and $589,168 of net proceeds were from equity financings (including proceeds received in connection with the exercise of common stock purchase warrants) partially offset by $863,302 of repayments on debt financings.\nWe anticipate that the costs to commence and complete our Phase 2 clinical trials with regard to our Disc/Spine Program will be at least $12,000,000. In addition, we anticipate approximately $45,000,000 in additional funding will be needed to complete the clinical trials using BRTX-100 (assuming the receipt of no revenues). As noted above in Availability of Additional Funds\u201d we secured additional funding as part of Chapter 11 reorganization in the aggregate amount of $5,037,961 as well as approximately $14,700,000 in outstanding debt and other liabilities being exchanged for (a) shares of common stock, (b) new convertible notes or (c) new convertible notes and warrants to purchase shares of common stock. Additionally, pursuant to the plan of reorganization, Auctus is required to loan to us, as needed and subject to our becoming current in our SEC reporting obligations, an additional amount equal to $3,500,000, less the amount of Auctus' DIP financing ($1,226,901, inclusive of accrued interest) and its DIP costs. As a result of the above, we have sufficient cash to fund operations for the twelve months subsequent to the filing date.\n 35 \n \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods. Our significant estimates and assumptions include the recoverability and useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair value of our common stock, stock-based compensation, warrants issued in connection with notes payable, derivative liabilities and the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets. Certain of our estimates, including the carrying amount of the intangible assets, could be affected by external conditions, including those unique to us and general economic conditions. It is reasonably possible that these external factors could have an effect on our estimates and could cause actual results to differ from those estimates.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are comprised of trademarks and licenses with original estimated useful lives of 10 and 17.7 years, respectively. Once placed into service, we amortize the cost of the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe review for the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. While our near term liquidity is tight, historically we have been successful in raising capital as needed (although there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in raising capital as needed). We continue to progress our scientific agenda and meet related milestones. We have not identified any impairment losses.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of items that have been included or excluded in our financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts, or temporary differences, at enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.\nWe adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 740-10, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statements recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. For employees and directors, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is generally re-measured on vesting dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value amount is then recognized over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. Since the shares underlying our Equity Participation Plan were registered on May 27, 2014, we estimate the fair value of the awards granted under the Plan based on the market value of our freely tradable common stock as reported on the OTC. The fair value of our restricted equity instruments was estimated by management based on observations of the cash sales prices of both restricted shares and freely tradable shares. Awards granted to directors are treated on the same basis as awards granted to employees.\n 36 \n \nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe evaluate our convertible instruments to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivative financial instruments to be separately accounted for in accordance with Topic 815 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) ASC. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that we record embedded conversion options ( ECOs\u201d) and any related freestanding instruments at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. Conversion options are recorded as a discount to the host instrument and are amortized as amortization of debt discount on the consolidated financial statements over the life of the underlying instrument. We reassess the classification of our derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification.\nThe Multinomial Lattice Model and Black-Scholes Model were used to estimate the fair value of the ECOs of convertible notes payable, the warrants, and stock options that are classified as derivative liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The models include subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. The expected volatility is estimated based on the actual volatility during the most recent historical period of time equal to the weighted average life of the instruments.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nFactors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition\nThe risk factors listed in this section provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. Readers should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nRisks Related to Our Business Generally\nWe have a limited operating history; we have incurred substantial losses since inception; we expect to continue to incur losses for the near term; as of December 31, 2019, we had a substantial working capital deficiency and a stockholders' deficiency and, as a consequence, on March 20, 2020, we filed a voluntary petition commencing a case under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nWe have a limited operating history. Since our inception, we have incurred net losses. As of December 31, 2019, we had a working capital deficiency of $13,651,716 and stockholders' deficit of $12,776,146. As a consequence, on March 20, 2020, we filed a voluntary petition commencing a case under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the Chapter 11 Case\u201d). On October 30, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the plan of reorganization pursuant to the Chapter 11 Case (the Plan of Reorganization\u201d) and on November 16, 2020, the Plan of Reorganization became effective.\n 37 \n \nWe will need to obtain a significant amount of financing to initiate and complete our clinical trials and implement our business plan.\nSince our inception, we have not generated significant revenues from our operations and have funded our operations through the sale of our equity securities and debt securities. The implementation of our business plan, as discussed in Item 1 ( Business\u201d), will require the receipt of sufficient equity and/or debt financing to purchase necessary equipment, technology and materials, fund our clinical trials and other research and development efforts, retire our outstanding debt and otherwise fund our operations. We anticipate that we will require approximately $12,000,000 in financing to commence and complete a Phase 2 clinical trial using BRTX-100. We anticipate that we will require approximately $45,000,000 in further additional funding to complete our clinical trials using BRTX-100 (assuming the receipt of no revenues). We will also require a substantial amount of additional funding to implement our other programs described in Item 1 ( Business\u201d), including our metabolic ThermoStem Program, repay our outstanding debt (assuming such debt is not converted into equity) and fund general operations. We received debtor-in-possession ( DIP\u201d) funding of $1,189,413 during the Chapter 11 Case and debt financing of $3,848,548 on the effective date of the Chapter 11 Case. The Plan of Reorganization provides for additional debt funding of $3,500,000 (less our DIP funding obligation, including accrued interest, of $1,226,901 at the effective date of the Chapter 11 Case, less DIP costs incurred by the DIP lender) as needed, from our DIP lender upon our becoming current in our SEC periodic report filings. The filing of this Annual Report will not satisfy such requirement as to being current with SEC filings. Such additional funding from the DIP lender, if received, will not be sufficient to satisfy our needs. No assurance can be given that the anticipated amounts of required funding are correct or that we will be able to accomplish our goals within the timeframes projected. In addition, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain any required financing on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise. In the event we do not obtain the financing required for the above purposes, we may have to curtail our development, marketing and promotional activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately we could be forced to discontinue our operations and liquidate.\nWe may need to obtain additional financing to satisfy debt obligations. An event of default pursuant to our outstanding debt obligations could trigger an acceleration of the due date of such obligations, including our secured debt.\nAs described in this Item 7 ( Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Availability of Additional Funds\u201d), as of December 31, 2019, our outstanding debt of $8,393,327, together with interest at rates ranging between 12 and 15% per annum, was due on various dates through December 18, 2020. As a consequence of such outstanding debt, as discussed above, on March 20, 2020, we commenced the Chapter 11 Case. Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, we issued 1,049,726,797 shares of common stock in exchange for unsecured claims of approximately $10,497,267. In addition, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, we have issued debt securities in the aggregate principal amount of $9,642,418 and, as indicated above, the DIP lender is required, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, to lend us an additional $3,500,000 (less our DIP funding obligation, including accrued interest, of $1,226,901 at the effective date of the Chapter 11 Case, less DIP costs incurred by the DIP lender), as needed. All such debt is repayable three years from the date of issuance (unless sooner converted into equity); however, an event of default pursuant to the secured and unsecured promissory notes evidencing such indebtedness could trigger an acceleration of the due dates of all of the notes. We do not have the financial resources to satisfy such debt obligations. Since the repayment of a substantial portion of our outstanding debt is secured by a security interest in all of our assets, in the event of a default, and foreclosure upon our assets, we could be forced to cease operations and liquidate.\nOur business strategy is high risk.\nWe are focusing our resources and efforts primarily on the development of cellular-based products and services which will require extensive cash for research, development and commercialization activities. This is a high-risk strategy because there is no assurance that our products and services, including our Disc/Spine Program and our ThermoStem metabolic brown fat research initiative, will ever become commercially viable (commercial risk), that we will prevent other companies from depriving us of market share and profit margins by offering services and products based on our inventions and developments (legal risk), that we will successfully manage a company in a new area of business, regenerative medicine, and on a different scale than we have operated in the past (operational risk), that we will be able to achieve the desired therapeutic results using stem and regenerative cells (scientific risk), or that our cash resources will be adequate to develop our products and services until we become profitable, if ever (financial risk). We are using our cash in one of the riskiest industries in the economy (strategic risk). This may make our securities an unsuitable investment for many investors.\nWe will need to enter into agreements in order to implement our business strategy.\nExcept for a certain license agreement with Regenerative Sciences, LLC described in Item 1 ( Business - Disc/Spine Program - License\u201d), we do not have any material agreements or understandings in place with respect to the implementation of our business strategy. No assurances can be given that we will be able to enter into any necessary agreements with respect to the development of our business. Our inability to enter into any such agreements would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n 38 \n \nWe depend on our executive officers and on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel; we do not currently have a Chief Financial Officer.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance of Lance Alstodt, our Chief Executive Officer. We rely upon him for strategic business decisions and guidance. Mr. Alstodt is not subject to an employment agreement with us. We are also dependent on the performance of Francisco Silva, our Vice President of Research and Development. Mr. Silva is subject to an employment agreement with us. We do not have any key-man insurance policies on the lives of either of our executive officers. We do not currently have a Chief Financial Officer. Pending the hiring of a Chief Financial Officer, we are utilizing financial consultants with regard to the preparation of our financial statements. We believe that our future success in developing marketable products and services and achieving a competitive position will depend in large part upon whether we can attract and retain additional qualified management and scientific personnel, including a Chief Financial Officer. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel. The loss of the services of Mr. Alstodt and/or Mr. Silva or the inability to attract and retain additional personnel, including a Chief Financial Officer, and develop expertise as needed would have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our results of operations and prospects.\nBeginning in March 2020, the global pandemic related to the novel coronavirus COVID-19 began to impact the global economy. Because of the size and breadth of this pandemic, all of the direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 are not yet known and may not emerge for some time. Risks presented by the ongoing effects of COVID-19 include, among others, the following:\nClinical Trials. We anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact our contemplated clinical trials. Due to the worldwide efforts being taken to combat COVID-19 and the increased clinical work being done in this respect, we believe that it may be difficult for certain needed laboratory supplies, equipment and other materials to be obtained in order to conduct our clinical trials. We also anticipate that, due to a fear of COVID-19 transmission, there may be a hesitancy on the part of certain individuals to become clinical trial participants. We hope that these possible negative effects will lessen as more of the population becomes vaccinated; however, the impact that the vaccinations will have is uncertain at this time.\nAdverse Legislative and/or Regulatory Action. Federal, state and local government actions to address and contain the impact of COVID-19 may adversely affect us. For example, we may be subject to legislative and/or regulatory action that negatively impacts the manner in which the clinical trials may be conducted.\nOperational Disruptions and Heightened Cybersecurity Risks. Our operations could be disrupted if key members of our senior management or a significant percentage of our workforce are unable to continue to work because of illness, government directives or otherwise. In addition, in connection with increased remote working arrangements, we face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents and are more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities.\nRisks Related to Our Cell Therapy Product Development Efforts\nOur future success is significantly dependent on the timely and successful development and commercialization of BRTX-100, our lead product candidate for the treatment of chronic lumbar disc disease; if we encounter delays or difficulties in the development of this product candidate, as well as any other product candidates, our business prospects would be significantly harmed.\nWe are dependent upon the successful development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates. Before we are able to seek regulatory approval of our product candidates, we must conduct and complete extensive clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy in humans. Our lead product candidate, BRTX-100, is in early stages of development and we have not yet commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial using BRTX-100 to treat chronic lower back pain due to degenerative disc disease related to protruding/bulging discs.\n 39 \n \nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, and can take many years to complete. Importantly, a failure of one or more of these or any other clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to complete our clinical studies, receive regulatory approval or commercialize our cell therapy product candidates, including the following:\n\n 40 \n \nAny inability to successfully complete pre-clinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenue. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may be required, or we may elect, to conduct additional studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical study delays could also shorten any periods during which our products have patent protection and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nEven if we are able to successfully complete our clinical development program for our product candidates, and ultimately receive regulatory approval to market one or more of the products, we may, among other things:\n\nWe anticipate that we will not be able to commercialize our BRTX-100 product candidate for at least five years.\nWe may experience delays and other difficulties in enrolling a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials which could delay or prevent the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals.\nWe may not be able to initiate or complete as planned any clinical trials if we are unable to identify and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. We also may be unable to engage a sufficient number of clinical trial sites to conduct our trials.\nWe may face challenges in enrolling patients to participate in our clinical trials due to the novelty of our cell-based therapies, the size of the patient populations and the eligibility criteria for enrollment in the trial. In addition, some patients may have concerns regarding cell therapy that may negatively affect their perception of therapies under development and their decision to enroll in the trials. Furthermore, patients suffering from diseases within target indications may enroll in competing clinical trials, which could negatively affect our ability to complete enrollment of our trials. Enrollment challenges in clinical trials often result in increased development costs for a product candidate, significant delays and potentially the abandonment of the clinical trial.\nWe may have other delays in completing our clinical trials and we may not complete them at all.\nWe have not commenced the clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA approval to market our product candidate, BRTX-100, or any of our other product candidates in development. Since our Company lacks significant experience in completing clinical trials and bringing a drug through commercialization, we have hired outside consultants with such experience. Clinical trials for BRTX-100 and other product candidates in development may be delayed or terminated as a result of many factors, including the following:\n \u25cf patients failing to complete clinical trials due to dissatisfaction with the treatment, side effects or other reasons; \u25cf failure by regulators to authorize us to commence a clinical trial; \u25cf suspension or termination by regulators of clinical research for many reasons, including concerns about patient safety, the failure of study sites and/or investigators in our clinical research program to comply with GCP requirements, or our failure, or the failure of our contract manufacturers, to comply with current cGMP requirements; \u25cf delays or failure to obtain clinical supply for our products necessary to conduct clinical trials from contract manufacturers; \n 41 \n \n \u25cf treatment candidates demonstrating a lack of efficacy during clinical trials; \u25cf treatment candidates demonstrating significant safety signals; and/or \u25cf inability to continue to fund clinical trials or to find a partner to fund the clinical trials. \nAny delay or failure to complete clinical trials and obtain FDA approval for our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our cost to develop and commercialize, and our ability to generate revenue from, a particular product candidate.\nThe development of our cell therapy product candidates is subject to uncertainty because autologous cell therapy is inherently variable.\nWhen manufacturing an autologous cell therapy, the number and composition of the cell population varies from patient to patient. Such variability in the number and composition of these cells could adversely affect our ability to manufacture autologous cell therapies in a cost-effective or profitable manner and meet acceptable product release specifications for use in a clinical trial or, if approved, for commercial sale. As a consequence, the development and regulatory approval process for autologous cell therapy products could be delayed or may never be completed.\nAny disruption to our access to the media (including cell culture media) and reagents we are using in the clinical development of our cell therapy product candidates could adversely affect our ability to perform clinical trials and seek future regulatory submissions.\nCertain media (including cell culture media) and reagents, as well as devices, materials and systems, that we intend to use in our planned clinical trials, and that we may need or use in commercial production, are provided by unaffiliated third parties. Any lack of continued availability of these media, reagents, devices, materials and systems for any reason would have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete these studies and could adversely impact our ability to achieve commercial manufacture of our planned therapeutic products. Although other available sources for these media, reagents, devices, materials and systems may exist in the marketplace, we have not evaluated their cost, effectiveness, or intellectual property foundation and therefore cannot guarantee the suitability or availability of such other potential sources.\nProducts that appear promising in research and development may be delayed or may fail to reach later stages of clinical development.\nThe successful development of cellular based products is highly uncertain. Product candidates that appear promising in preclinical and early research and development may be delayed or fail to reach later stages of development. Decisions regarding the further development of product candidates must be made with limited and incomplete data, which makes it difficult to ensure or even accurately predict whether the allocation of limited resources and the expenditure of additional capital on specific product candidates will result in desired outcomes. Pre-clinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways, and negative or inconclusive results or adverse events during a clinical trial could delay, limit or prevent the development of a product candidate. Positive preclinical data may not continue or occur for future subjects in our clinical studies and may not be repeated or observed in ongoing or future studies involving our product candidates. Furthermore, our product candidates may also fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in later stages of clinical development despite having successfully advanced through initial clinical studies. In addition, regulatory delays or rejections may be encountered as a result of many factors, including changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development.\nOur clinical trials may fail to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, which would prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization.\nThe clinical trials of our product candidates are, and the manufacturing and marketing of our products will be, subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and in other countries where we intend to test and market our product candidates. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate through lengthy, complex and expensive preclinical testing and clinical trials that our product candidates are both safe and effective for use in each target indication. In particular, because our product candidates are subject to regulation as biological drug products, we will need to demonstrate that they are safe, pure, and potent for use in their target indications. Each product candidate must demonstrate an adequate risk versus benefit profile in its intended patient population and for its intended use. The risk/benefit profile required for product licensure will vary depending on these factors and may include decrease or elimination of pain, adequate duration of response, a delay in the progression of the disease, an improvement in function and/or decrease in disability.\n 42 \n \nIn addition, even if such trials are successfully completed, we cannot guarantee that the FDA will interpret the results as we do, and more trials could be required before we submit our product candidates for approval. To the extent that the results of the trials are not satisfactory to the FDA for support of a marketing application, we may be required to expend significant resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of our product candidates.\nEven if we complete the necessary clinical trials, we cannot predict when, or if, we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate, and the approval may be for a narrower indication than we seek.\nWe cannot commercialize a product candidate until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the product candidate. Even if our product candidates meet their safety and efficacy endpoints in clinical trials, the regulatory authorities may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval. Additional delays may result if an FDA Advisory Committee or other regulatory authority recommends non-approval or restrictions or conditions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory authority policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and the review process. Regulatory authorities also may approve a product candidate for more limited indications than requested or they may impose significant limitations in the form of narrow indications, contraindications or a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS\u201d). These regulatory authorities may require warnings or precautions with respect to conditions of use or they may grant approval subject to the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, regulatory authorities may not approve the labeling claims or allow the promotional claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may never obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates in the United States and, even if we do, we may never obtain approval for or commercialize any of our product candidates in any foreign jurisdiction, which would limit our ability to realize our full market potential.\nIn order to eventually market any of our product candidates in any particular foreign jurisdiction, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements regarding safety and efficacy on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. Approval by the FDA in the United States, if obtained, does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions. In addition, preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other country.\nApproval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our product candidates in those countries. The foreign regulatory approval process involves similar risks to those associated with FDA approval. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including international markets, nor have we attempted to obtain such approval. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products may be unrealized.\nWe presently lack manufacturing capabilities to produce our product candidates at commercial scale quantities and do not have an alternate manufacturing supply, which could negatively impact our ability to meet any future demand for the products.\nCurrently, we expect our laboratory (or a contract laboratory) to provide the cell processing services necessary for clinical production of BRTX-100 for our disc clinical trial. To date, we have not produced any products at our laboratory. We expect that we would need to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities to meet potential commercial demand for BRTX-100 and any other of our product candidates, if approved, as well as any of our other product candidates that might attain regulatory approval. Such expansion would require additional regulatory approvals. Even if we increase our manufacturing capabilities, it is possible that we may still lack sufficient capacity to meet demand. Ultimately, if we are unable to supply our products to meet commercial demand, whether because of processing constraints or other disruptions, delays or difficulties that we experience, sales of the products and their long-term commercial prospects could be significantly damaged.\n 43 \n \nWe do not presently have a third-party manufacturer for BRTX-100 or any of our other product candidates. If our facilities at which these product candidates would be manufactured or our equipment were significantly damaged or destroyed, or if there were other disruptions, delays or difficulties affecting manufacturing capacity, our planned and future clinical studies and commercial production for these product candidates would likely be significantly disrupted and delayed. It would be both time consuming and expensive to replace this capacity with third parties, particularly since any new facility would need to comply with the regulatory requirements.\nUltimately, if we are unable to supply our cell therapy product candidates to meet commercial demand (assuming commercial approval is obtained), whether because of processing constraints or other disruptions, delays or difficulties that we experience, our production costs could dramatically increase and sales of the product and its long-term commercial prospects could be significantly damaged.\nThe commercial potential and profitability of our products are unknown and subject to significant risk and uncertainty.\nEven if we successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for our cell therapy product candidates, the market may not understand or accept the products, which could adversely affect both the timing and level of future sales. Ultimately, the degree of market acceptance of our product candidates (or any of our future product candidates) will depend on a number of factors, including:\n \u25cf the clinical effectiveness, safety and convenience of the product particularly in relation to alternative treatments; \u25cf our ability to distinguish our products (which involve adult cells) from any ethical and political controversies associated with stem cell products derived from human embryonic or fetal tissue; and \u25cf the cost of the product, the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors and our ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement. \nEven if we are successful in achieving sales of our product candidates, it is not clear to what extent, if any, the products will be profitable. The costs of goods associated with production of cell therapy products are significant. In addition, some changes in manufacturing processes or procedures generally require FDA or foreign regulatory authority review and approval prior to implementation. We may need to conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials to support approval of any such changes. Furthermore, this review process could be costly and time-consuming and could delay or prevent the commercialization of product candidates.\nWe may have difficulties in sourcing brown adipose (fat) tissue.\nWe use brown adipose (fat) tissue to identify and characterize brown adipose derived stem cells for use in our pre-clinical ThermoStem Program. There is no certainty that we will be able to continue to collect brown adipose samples through any relationships that we have, have had or may establish with potential sources of brown adipose tissue. The inability to procure brown fat tissue would have a material adverse effect upon our ability to advance our ThermoStem Program.\nWe are required to complete a certain milestone to maintain our exclusive license rights with regard to the disc/spine technology. The loss of such exclusive rights would have a material adverse effect upon us.\nPursuant to our license agreement with Regenerative Sciences, LLC, we must complete our Phase 2 clinical trial by a certain date (which we believe to be February 2022) in order to maintain our exclusive rights with regard to the disc/spine technology. It is not anticipated that we will achieve such milestone. Any loss of such exclusive rights would have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Business-Disc/Spine Program - License.\u201d\n 44 \n \nIf safety problems are encountered by us or others developing new stem cell-based therapies, our stem cell initiatives could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe use of stem cells for therapeutic indications is still in the very early stages of development. If an adverse event occurs during clinical trials related to one of our proposed products and/or services or those of others, the FDA and other regulatory authorities may halt clinical trials or require additional studies. The occurrence of any of these events would delay, and increase the cost of, our development efforts and may render the commercialization of our proposed products and/or services impractical or impossible.\nWe are vulnerable to competition and technological change, and also to physicians' inertia.\nWe will compete with many domestic and foreign companies in developing our technology and products, including biotechnology, medical device and pharmaceutical companies. Many current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing, and personnel resources. There is no assurance that our competitors will not succeed in developing alternative products and/or services that are more effective, easier to use, or more economical than those which we may develop, or that would render our products and/or services obsolete and non-competitive. In general, we may not be able to prevent others from developing and marketing competitive products and/or services similar to ours or which perform similar functions or which are marketed before ours.\nCompetitors may have greater experience in developing products, therapies or devices, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals, manufacturing and commercialization. It is possible that competitors may obtain patent protection, approval or clearance from the FDA or achieve commercialization earlier than we can, any of which could have a substantial negative effect on our business.\nWe will compete against cell-based therapies derived from alternate sources, such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord blood and potentially embryos. Doctors historically are slow to adopt new technologies like ours, whatever the merits, when older technologies continue to be supported by established providers. Overcoming such inertia often requires very significant marketing expenditures or definitive product performance and/or pricing superiority.\nWe expect that physicians' inertia and skepticism will also be a significant barrier as we attempt to gain market penetration with our future products and services. We may need to finance lengthy time-consuming clinical studies (so as to provide convincing evidence of the medical benefit) in order to overcome this inertia and skepticism.\nWe may form or seek collaborations or strategic alliances or enter into additional licensing arrangements in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances or licensing arrangements.\nWe may form or seek strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations, or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to our product candidates and any future product candidates that we may develop. Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute the shares of our existing stockholders, or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. To date, such efforts have not been successful.\nFurther, collaborations involving our product candidates, such as our collaborations with third-party research institutions, are subject to numerous risks, which may include the following:\n \u25cf collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to a collaboration; \u25cf collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products, availability of funding, or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities; \n 45 \n \n \u25cf collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial, stop a clinical trial, abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing; \u25cf collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates; \u25cf a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to their marketing and distribution; \u25cf collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability; \u25cf disputes may arise between us and a collaborator that cause the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; \u25cf collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates; and \u25cf collaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our products that results from our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we would not have the exclusive right to commercialize such intellectual property. \nAs a result, if we enter into collaboration agreements and strategic partnerships or license our products or businesses, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture, which could delay our timelines or otherwise adversely affect our business. We also cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction. Any delays in entering into new collaborations or strategic partnership agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates in certain geographies for certain indications, which would harm our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have limited experience in the development and marketing of cell therapies and may be unsuccessful in our efforts to establish a profitable business.\nOur business plan has been focused historically on capturing a piece of the burgeoning field of cell therapy. We have limited experience in the areas of cell therapy product development and marketing, and in the related regulatory issues and processes. Although we have recruited a team that has experience with designing and conducting clinical trials and hired contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations and FDA consultants, as a company, we have limited experience in conducting clinical trials and no experience in conducting clinical trials through to regulatory approval of any product candidate. In part because of this lack of experience, we cannot be certain that planned clinical trials will begin or be completed on time, if at all. We cannot assure that we will successfully achieve our clinical development goals or fulfill our plans to capture a piece of the cell therapy market.\nOur cell therapy business is based on novel technologies that are inherently expensive, risky and may not be understood by or accepted in the marketplace, which could adversely affect our future value.\nThe clinical development, commercialization and marketing of cell and tissue-based therapies are at an early-stage, substantially research-oriented, and financially speculative. To date, very few companies have been successful in their efforts to develop and commercialize a cell therapy product. In general, cell-based or tissue-based products may be susceptible to various risks, including undesirable and unintended side effects, unintended immune system responses, inadequate therapeutic efficacy, or other characteristics that may prevent or limit their approval or commercial use. In addition, BRTX-100 is a cell-based candidate that is produced by using a patient's own stem cells derived from bone marrow. Regulatory approval of novel product candidates such as BRTX-100, which is manufactured using novel manufacturing processes, can be more complex and expensive and take longer than other, more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical products, due to the FDA's lack of experience with them. To our knowledge, the FDA has not yet approved a disc related stem cell therapy product. This lack of experience may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to conduct additional studies or clinical trials, which would increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these product candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. Furthermore, the number of people who may use cell or tissue-based therapies is difficult to forecast with accuracy. Our future success is dependent on the establishment of a large global market for cell- and tissue-based therapies and our ability to capture a share of this market with our product candidates.\n 46 \n \nOur cell therapy product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biologic products may face competition sooner than anticipated.\nThe enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 ( BPCIA\u201d) created an abbreviated regulatory pathway for the approval of products demonstrated to be biosimilar, or highly similar,\u201d to or interchangeable\u201d with an FDA-approved innovator (original) biologic product. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable\u201d based on its similarity to an existing reference product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product is approved under a biologics license application ( BLA\u201d). Although the FDA has approved several biosimilar products, complex provisions of the law are still being implemented by the FDA and interpreted by the federal courts. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning of the BPCIA are still subject to some uncertainty and FDA actions and court decisions concerning the law could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.\nWe believe that, if any of our product candidates are approved as a biological product under a BLA, it should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that the FDA could approve biosimilar applicants for other reference products that no longer have such exclusivity, thus potentially creating the opportunity for greater competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nThe FDA's regulation of regenerative medicine products remains unpredictable and we are not certain what impact this will have on the potential approval of our products.\nThe FDA's regulation of therapies derived from stem cell products and technologies is evolving and may continue to evolve. In December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (the Cures Act\u201d) was signed into law in the United States to advance access to medical innovations. Among other things, the Cures Act established a new FDA regenerative medicine advanced therapy ( RMAT\u201d) designation. This designation offers a variety of benefits to product candidates, including enhanced FDA support during clinical development, priority review on application filing, accelerated approval based on potential surrogate endpoints, and the potential use of patient registry data and other forms of real world evidence for post-approval confirmatory studies. There is no certainty that any of our product candidates will receive RMAT designation or any other type of expedited review program designation from the FDA. In any event, the receipt of an FDA RMAT designation or other expedited review program designation may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to products considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA.\nWe may be subject to significant product liability claims and litigation, including potential exposure from the use of our product candidates in human subjects, and our insurance may be inadequate to cover claims that may arise.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks inherent in the testing, processing and marketing of cell therapy products. Such liability claims may be expensive to defend and result in large judgments against us. We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our current and any future product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk with respect to any commercial sales of our products should they be approved. No product candidate has been widely used over an extended period of time, and therefore safety data is limited. Cell therapy companies derive the raw materials for manufacturing of product candidates from human cell sources, and therefore the manufacturing process and handling requirements are extensive, which increases the risk of quality failures and subsequent product liability claims.\nWe will need to maintain insurance coverage adequate to cover our clinical trials and increase that coverage before commercializing product candidates, if ever. At any time during our clinical trials or after commercialization, if that occurs, we may not be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or at all, or if claims against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our financial position could be significantly impaired.\n 47 \n \nWhether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation that may arise, such litigation could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, result in decreased demand for our products and injure our reputation.\nWe seek to maintain errors and omissions, directors and officers, workers' compensation and other insurance at levels we believe to be appropriate to our business activities. If, however, we were subject to a claim in excess of this coverage or to a claim not covered by our insurance and the claim succeeded, we would be required to pay the claim from our own limited resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business. Additionally, liability or alleged liability could harm our business by diverting the attention and resources of our management and damaging our reputation.\nOur internal computer systems, or those that are expected to be used by our clinical investigators, clinical research organizations or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of development programs for our product candidates.\nWe rely on information technology systems to keep financial records, maintain laboratory and corporate records, communicate with staff and external parties and operate other critical functions. Any significant degradation or failure of these computer systems could cause us to inaccurately calculate or lose data. Despite the implementation of security measures, these internal computer systems and those used by our clinical investigators, clinical research organizations, and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. The techniques that could be used by criminal elements or foreign governments to attack these computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. While we have not experienced any such system failure, theft of information, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our clinical development activities. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from historical or future clinical trials could result in delays in regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption, theft of information, or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the clinical development and the future development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nTo operate and sell in international markets carries great risk.\nWe intend to market our products and services both domestically and in foreign markets. A number of risks are inherent in international transactions. In order for us to market our products and services in non-U.S. jurisdictions, we need to obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals or clearances in these countries and must comply with the country specific regulations regarding safety, manufacturing processes and quality. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearances to market, may differ from the FDA regulatory scheme. International operations and sales also may be limited or disrupted by political instability, price controls, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs. Additionally, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect demand for our services and products by increasing the price of our products and services in the currency of the countries in which the products and services are offered.\nThere can be no assurance that we will obtain regulatory approvals or clearances in all of the countries where we intend to market our products and services, or that we will not incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or clearances, or that we will be able to successfully commercialize our products and services in various foreign markets. Delays in receipt of approvals or clearances to market our products and services in foreign countries, failure to receive such approvals or clearances or the future loss of previously received approvals or clearances could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to obtain reimbursement for our products and services from private and governmental insurers could negatively impact demand for our products and services.\nMarket acceptance and sales of our product candidates may depend on coverage and reimbursement policies and health care reform measures. Decisions about formulary coverage as well as levels at which government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, reimburse patients for the price they pay for our product candidates, as well as levels at which these payors pay directly for our product candidates, where applicable, could affect whether we are able to successfully commercialize these products. We cannot guarantee that reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates. We also cannot guarantee that coverage or reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our product candidates.\n 48 \n \nIf coverage and reimbursement are not available or are available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA\u201d) and other health reform proposals include measures that would limit or prohibit payments for certain medical treatments or subject the pricing of drugs to government control. In addition, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the European Union (the EU\u201d), the pricing of drugs and biologics is subject to government control. If our products are or become subject to government regulation that limits or prohibits payment for our products, or that subjects the price of our products to government control, we may not be able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.\nIn addition, third-party payors are increasingly limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs and biologics. They may also impose strict prior authorization requirements and/or refuse to provide any coverage of uses of approved products for medical indications other than those for which the FDA has granted market approvals. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payors will reimburse patients for their use of newly-approved drugs and biologics. If we are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement for our product candidates, our ability to successfully market and sell our product candidates will be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary rights.\nOur commercial success will depend in large part upon our ability to protect our proprietary rights. There is no assurance, for example, that any additional patents will be issued based on our or our licensor's pending applications or, if issued, that such patents will not become the subject of a re-examination, will provide us with competitive advantages, will not be challenged by any third parties, or that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products and services incorporating our technology. Furthermore, there can be no guarantee that others will not independently develop similar products and services, duplicate any of our products and services, or design around any patents we obtain.\nOur commercial success will also depend upon our ability to avoid infringing patents issued to others. If we were judicially determined to be infringing on any third-party patent, we could be required to pay damages, alter our products, services or processes, obtain licenses, or cease certain activities. If we are required in the future to obtain any licenses from third parties for some of our products and/or services, there can be no guarantee that we would be able to do so on commercially favorable terms, if at all. United States and foreign patent applications are not immediately made public, so we might be surprised by the grant to someone else of a patent on a technology we are actively using. Although we conducted a freedom to operate ( FTO\u201d) search on the licensed technology associated with our Disc/Spine Program, modifications made, and/or further developments that may be made, to that technology may not be covered by the initial FTO. No FTO has been undertaken with respect to our ThermoStem brown fat initiative.\nLitigation, which would result in substantial costs to us and the diversion of effort on our part, may be necessary to enforce or confirm the ownership of any patents issued or licensed to us, or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. If our competitors claim technology also claimed by us and prepare and file patent applications in the United States, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the Patent Office\u201d) or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of effort, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Any such litigation or interference proceeding, regardless of outcome, could be expensive and time-consuming.\nSuccessful challenges to our patents through oppositions, re-examination proceedings or interference proceedings could result in a loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we are unsuccessful in actions we bring against the patents of other parties, and it is determined that we infringe upon the patents of third parties, we may be subject to litigation, or otherwise prevented from commercializing potential products and/or services in the relevant jurisdiction, or may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or develop or obtain alternative technologies, any of which could harm our business. Furthermore, if such challenges to our patent rights are not resolved in our favor, we could be delayed or prevented from entering into new collaborations or from commercializing certain products and/or services, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n 49 \n \nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation. In addition, during the course of litigation there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. Some of our intended future cell-related therapeutic products and/or services may fit into this category. We also rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with our partners, employees, advisors, vendors, and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. There can be no guarantee that these agreements will not be breached, or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.\nFailure to obtain or maintain patent protection, failure to protect trade secrets, third-party claims against our patents, trade secrets, or proprietary rights or our involvement in disputes over our patents, trade secrets, or proprietary rights, including involvement in litigation, could divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business and have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property in countries outside of the United States.\nIntellectual property law outside the United States is uncertain and, in many countries, is currently undergoing review and revisions. The laws of some countries do not protect our patent and other intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States laws. Third parties may attempt to oppose the issuance of patents to us in foreign countries by initiating opposition proceedings. Opposition proceedings against any of our patent filings in a foreign country could have an adverse effect on our corresponding patents that are issued or pending in the United States. It may be necessary or useful for us to participate in proceedings to determine the validity of our patents or our competitors' patents that have been issued in countries other than the United States. This could result in substantial costs, divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges to United States patent law may have a material adverse effect on our intellectual property rights.\nThe Leahy-Smith America Invents Act ( AIA\u201d), which was signed into law in 2011, significantly changes United States patent law. It may take some time to establish what the law means, since it is just being interpreted by the lower courts, Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal, and the Supreme Court. The effects of these decisions are still not known. The first major change is that AIA switches the United States patent system from a first to invent\u201d system to a first to file\u201d system. Now that the first to file system is in effect, there is a risk that another company may independently develop identical or similar patents at approximately the same time, and be awarded the patents instead of us. Further, for the second major change, AIA abolished interference proceedings, and establishes derivation proceedings to replace interference proceedings in all cases in which the time period for instituting an interference proceeding has not lapsed where an inventor named in an earlier application derived the claimed invention from a named inventor. Now that the derivation proceedings are in effect, there is a risk that the inventorship of any pending patent application can be challenged for reasons of derivation. The third major change is that AIA established post-grant opposition proceedings that will apply only to patent applications filed after first to file\u201d became effective. Post-grant opposition will enable a person who is not the patent owner to initiate proceedings in the Patent Office within nine months after the grant of a patent that can result in cancellation of a patent as invalid. In addition to AIA, recent court decisions have created uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain and maintain patents. Therefore there is a risk that any of our patents once granted may be subject to post-grant opposition, which will increase uncertainty on the validity of any newly granted patent or may ultimately result in cancellation of the patent.\nIn addition, the Supreme Court has recently taken more limiting positions as to what constitutes patentable subject matter. As a result, many patents covering what were previously patentable inventions are now determined to cover inventions which are deemed non-statutory subject matter and are now invalid. As a result of this and subsequent opinions by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the Patent Office is now applying more stringent limitations to claims in patent applications and is refusing to grant patents in areas of technology where patents were previously deemed available. Therefore there is a risk that we will be unable to acquire patents to cover our products and if such patents are granted they may subsequently be found to be invalid.\n 50 \n \nIn certain countries, patent holders may be required to grant compulsory licenses, which would likely have a significant and detrimental effect on any future revenues in such country.\nMany countries, including some countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, most countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may be limited to monetary relief and may be unable to enjoin infringement, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. Compulsory licensing of life-saving products is also becoming increasingly common in developing countries, either through direct legislation or international initiatives. Such compulsory licenses could be extended to our product candidates, which may limit our potential revenue opportunities, including with respect to any future revenues that may result from our product candidates.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, our products will remain subject to regulatory oversight.\nOur product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information. Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates also may be subject to a REMS or the specific obligations imposed as a condition for marketing authorization by equivalent authorities in a foreign jurisdiction, limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the quality, safety and efficacy of the product. For example, in the United States, the holder of an approved new drug application ( NDA\u201d) or BLA is obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA or BLA. The holder of an approved NDA or BLA also must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ( FDCA\u201d) and implementing regulations and are subject to FDA oversight and post-marketing reporting obligations, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws.\nIn addition, product manufacturers and their facilities may be subject to payment of application and program fees and are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP requirements and adherence to commitments made in the NDA, BLA or foreign marketing application. If we or a regulatory authority discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or if a regulatory authority disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of our product, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions relative to that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements for any product candidate following approval, a regulatory authority may:\n \u25cf issue a warning or untitled letter asserting that we are in violation of the law; \u25cf seek an injunction or impose administrative, civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines; \u25cf suspend or withdraw regulatory approval; \u25cf suspend any ongoing clinical trials; \u25cf refuse to approve a pending BLA or comparable foreign marketing application (or any supplements thereto) submitted by us or our strategic partners; \u25cf restrict the marketing or manufacturing of the product; \u25cf seize or detain the product or otherwise demand or require the withdrawal or recall of the product from the market; \u25cf refuse to permit the import or export of products; \u25cf request and publicize a voluntary recall of the product; or \u25cf refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. \n 51 \n \nAny government enforcement action or investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nIn the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drugs and biologic products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local authorities, including the FDA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d), other divisions the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS\u201d) (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice offices of the United States Attorney, the Federal Trade Commission and state and local governments. Our operations are directly, or indirectly through our prescribers, customers and purchasers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute ( AKS\u201d), the federal civil and criminal False Claims Act ( FCA\u201d), the Physician Payments Sunshine Act and regulations and equivalent provisions in other countries. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy laws by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.\nState and federal regulatory and enforcement agencies continue actively to investigate violations of health care laws and regulations, and the United States Congress continues to strengthen the arsenal of enforcement tools. Most recently, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the criminal and civil penalties that can be imposed for violating certain federal health care laws, including the AKS. Enforcement agencies also continue to pursue novel theories of liability under these laws. Government agencies have recently increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement activity with respect to programs supported or sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, including reimbursement and co-pay support, funding of independent charitable foundations and other programs that offer benefits for patients. Several investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other government regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business.\nFurther, in the event we determine to operate in foreign jurisdictions, including conducting clinical trials, we will need to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the FCPA\u201d). The FCPA prohibits a corporation, including its subsidiaries, third-party contractors, distributors, consultants and employees, from corruptly making or offering to make payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or enhancing business. Under the law, foreign officials\u201d include employees of health systems operated by government entities. The FCPA also establishes specific record-keeping and internal accounting controls. Violations of the FCPA can result in the imposition of civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Failure to comply with the FCPA will adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to the FCPA, we will also need to comply with the foreign government laws and regulations of each individual country in which any therapy centers that we may establish are located and products are to be distributed and sold. These regulations vary in complexity and can be as stringent, and on occasion even more stringent, than FDA regulations in the United States. Due to the fact that there are new and emerging stem cell and cell therapy regulations that have recently been drafted and/or implemented in various countries around the world, the application and subsequent implementation of these new and emerging regulations have little to no precedence. Therefore, the level of complexity and stringency is not always precisely understood today for each country, creating greater uncertainty for the international regulatory process. Furthermore, there can be no guarantee that laws and regulations will not be implemented, amended and/or reinterpreted in a way that will negatively affect our business. Likewise, there can be no assurance that we will be able, or will have the resources, to maintain compliance with all such healthcare laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such healthcare laws and regulations, as well as the costs associated with such compliance or with enforcement of such healthcare laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our operations or may require restructuring of our operations or impair our ability to operate profitably.\n 52 \n \nOur current and future employees, consultants and advisors and our future principal investigators, medical institutions and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our current and future employees, consultants and advisors and our future principal investigators, medical institutions and commercial partners, including contract laboratories, and CROs. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or the regulations applicable in other jurisdictions, provide accurate information to the FDA and other regulatory authorities, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us.\nWe currently do not and in the future may not independently conduct all aspects of our product candidate research and preclinical and clinical testing and product candidate manufacturing. If we rely on third parties, including CROs, medical institutions, and contract laboratories to monitor and manage data for our ongoing preclinical and clinical programs, we will still maintain responsibility for ensuring their activities are conducted in accordance with the applicable study protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards. We and our third-party vendors will be required to comply with current cGMP, GCP, and Good Laboratory Practice ( GLP\u201d) requirements, which are a collection of laws and regulations enforced by the FDA, the EU and comparable foreign authorities for all of our product candidates in clinical development.\nIn addition, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Such misconduct also could involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or interactions with the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation.\nThe precautions we take to detect and prevent employee and third-party misconduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nThe failure to receive regulatory approvals for our cell therapy product candidates would likely have a material and adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nTo date, we have not received regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates in any jurisdiction. If we seek approval of any of our cell therapy product candidates, we will be required to submit to the FDA and potentially other regulatory authorities extensive pre-clinical and clinical data supporting its safety and efficacy, as well as information about the manufacturing process and to undergo inspection of our manufacturing facility or other contract manufacturing facilities, among other things. The process of obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals is expensive, generally takes many years and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, particularly with complex and/or novel product candidates such as our cell-based product candidates. Changes in regulatory approval requirements or policies may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application or may make it easier for our competitors to gain regulatory approval to enter the marketplace. Ultimately, the FDA and other regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our product candidate data are insufficient for approval without the submission of additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying agency interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate. Any difficulties or failures that we encounter in securing regulatory approval for our product candidates would likely have a substantial adverse impact on our ability to generate product sales, and could make any search for a collaborative partner more difficult. Similarly, any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\n 53 \n \nIf we are unable to conduct clinical studies in accordance with regulations and accepted standards, we may be delayed in receiving, or may never receive, regulatory approvals of our product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.\nTo obtain marketing approvals for our product candidates in the United States and abroad, we must, among other requirements, complete adequate and well-controlled clinical trials sufficient to demonstrate to the FDA and other regulatory bodies that the product candidate is safe and effective for each indication for which approval is sought. If the FDA finds that patients enrolled in the trial are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury, due to, among other things, occurrence of a serious adverse event in an ongoing clinical trial, the FDA can place one or more of our clinical trials on hold. If safety concerns develop, we may, or the FDA or an institutional review board may require us to, stop the affected trials before completion.\nThe completion of our clinical trials also may be delayed or terminated for a number of other reasons, including if:\n \u25cf third-party clinical investigators do not perform the clinical trials on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices required by the FDA and other regulatory requirements, or other third parties do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner; \u25cf inspections of clinical trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities reveal violations that require us to undertake corrective action, suspend or terminate one or more sites, or prohibit use of some or all of the data in support of marketing applications; or \u25cf the FDA or one or more institutional review boards suspends or terminates the trial at an investigational site, or precludes enrollment of additional subjects. \nOur development costs will increase if there are material delays in our clinical trials, or if we are required to modify, suspend, terminate or repeat a clinical trial. If we are unable to conduct our clinical trials properly, we may never receive regulatory approval to market our product candidates.\nHealth care companies have been the subjects of federal and state investigations, and we could become subject to investigations in the future.\nBoth federal and state government agencies have heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. There are numerous ongoing investigations of health care companies, as well as their executives and managers. In addition, amendments to the federal FCA, including under healthcare reform legislation, have made it easier for private parties to bring qui tam\u201d (or whistleblower) lawsuits against companies under which the whistleblower may be entitled to receive a percentage of any money paid to the government. The FCA provides, in part, that an action can be brought against any person or entity that has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. The government has taken the position that claims presented in violation of the federal AKS, Stark Law or other healthcare-related laws, including laws enforced by the FDA, may be considered a violation of the FCA. Penalties include substantial fines for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person or entity and/or exclusion from the Medicare program. In addition, a majority of states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions.\nWe are not aware of any government investigations involving any of our facilities or management. While we believe that we are in compliance with applicable governmental healthcare laws and regulations, any future investigations of our business or executives could cause us to incur substantial costs, and result in significant liabilities or penalties, as well as damage to our reputation.\n 54 \n \nIt is uncertain to what extent the government, private health insurers and third-party payors will approve coverage or provide reimbursement for the therapies and products to which our services relate. Availability for such reimbursement may be further limited by reductions in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare program funding in the United States.\nTo the extent that health care providers cannot obtain coverage or reimbursement for our products and therapies, they may elect not to provide such products and therapies to their patients and, thus, may not need our services. Further, as cost containment pressures are increasing in the health care industry, government and private payors may adopt strategies designed to limit the amount of reimbursement paid to health care providers.\nSimilarly, the trend toward managed health care and bundled pricing for health care services in the United States, could significantly influence the purchase of healthcare products and services, resulting in lower prices and reduced demand for our therapeutic products under development.\nWe may directly or indirectly receive revenues from federal health care programs, such as Medicare. Federal health care programs are subject to changes in coverage and reimbursement rules and procedures, including retroactive rate adjustments. These contingencies could materially decrease the range of services covered by such programs or the reimbursement rates paid directly or indirectly for our products and services. To the extent that any health care reform favors the reimbursement of other therapies over our therapeutic products under development, such reform could affect our ability to sell our services, which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nThe limitation on reimbursement available from private and government payors may reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Additional legislation or regulation relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future which could adversely affect the revenues generated from the sale of our products and services.\nFurthermore, there has been a trend in recent years towards reductions in overall funding for Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. There has also been an increase in the number of people who are not eligible for or enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. The reduced funding of governmental programs could have a negative impact on the demand for our services to the extent it relates to products and services which are reimbursed by government and private payors.\nUnintended consequences of healthcare reform in the United States may adversely affect our business.\nThe healthcare industry is undergoing fundamental changes resulting from political, economic and regulatory influences. In the United States, the PPACA was signed into law in 2010 under the Obama administration. By implementing comprehensive reforms, the law seeks to, among other things, increase access to healthcare for the uninsured and control the escalation of healthcare expenditures within the economy. While we do not believe this law will have a direct impact on our business, the law requires the adoption of various implementing regulations, which may have unintended consequences or indirectly impact our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In the past two years, Congress has considered additional reductions in Medicare reimbursement for drugs and devices as part of legislation to reduce the budget deficit. Similar legislation could be enacted in the future. The Medicare regulations and interpretive determinations that determine how drugs, devices and services are covered and reimbursed also are subject to change. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could impact our business.\nHealthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and decreased reimbursement. Under the Trump administration, Congress passed certain legislation to alter the PPACA. In addition, Congress and select states have proposed legislation to alter and/or repeal the PPACA and/or transform certain aspects of existing federal and state health programs. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates. It is difficult to predict how enforcement initiatives under the PPACA and/or additional legislation or regulation enacted in the future may impact our business. If the PPACA and/or additional legislation or regulation enacted in the future cause such unintended consequences or indirect impact, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n 55 \n \nCompetitor companies or hospitals in the EU may be able to take advantage of EU rules permitting sales of unlicensed medicines for individual patients to sell competing products without a marketing authorization.\nThe EU medicines rules allow individual member states to permit the supply of a medicinal product without a marketing authorization to fulfill special needs, where the product is supplied in response to a bona fide unsolicited order, formulated in accordance with the specifications of a healthcare professional and for use by an individual patient under his direct personal responsibility. This may, in certain countries, also apply to products manufactured in a country outside the EU and imported to treat specific patients or small groups of patients. In addition, advanced therapy medicinal products do not need a marketing authorization if they are prepared on a non-routine basis and are used within the same EU member state in a hospital in accordance with a medical prescription for an individual patient.\nThese exemptions could allow our competitors to make sales in the EU without having obtained a marketing authorization and without undergoing the expense of clinical trials, especially if those competitors have cell processing facilities in the relevant EU member state. Similarly, certain hospitals may be able to compete with us on the basis of these rules.\nRisks Related to and Our Common Stock\nWe pay no dividends.\nWe have never paid cash dividends in the past, and currently do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThere is at present only a limited market for our common stock, and there is no assurance that an active trading market for our securities will develop.\nThe market for our common stock is limited. No assurance can be given that an active market for our shares will develop or, if developed, will be sustained. In addition, although there have been market makers in our common stock, we cannot assure that these market makers will continue to make a market in our securities or that other factors outside of our control will not cause them to stop market making in our securities. Making a market in securities involves maintaining bid and ask quotations and being able to effect transactions in reasonable quantities at those quoted prices, subject to various securities laws and other regulatory requirements. Furthermore, the development and maintenance of a public trading market depends upon the existence of willing buyers and sellers, the presence of which is not within our control or that of any market maker. Market makers are not required to maintain a continuous two-sided market, are required to honor firm quotations for only a limited number of securities, and are free to withdraw firm quotations at any time. Even with a market maker, factors such as our past losses from operations and the small size of our company mean that there can be no assurance of an active and liquid market for our securities developing in the foreseeable future. Even if a market develops, we cannot assure that a market will continue, or that stockholders will be able to resell their securities at any price.\nStockholders who hold unregistered shares of our common stock are subject to resale restrictions pursuant to Rule 144 due to our former status as a shell company.\u201d\nWe previously were a shell company\u201d pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act ( Rule 144\u201d), and, as such, sales of our securities pursuant to Rule 144 cannot be made unless, among other things, we continue to remain subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and we file all of our required periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Because our unregistered securities cannot be sold pursuant to Rule 144 unless we continue to meet such requirements, any unregistered securities we sell in the future or issue to consultants or employees, in consideration for services rendered or for any other purpose, will have no liquidity unless we continue to comply with such requirements. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to obtain financing to fund our operations and pay our consultants and employees with our securities instead of cash.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, increased costs as a result of being an SEC reporting company.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as a variety of related rules implemented by the SEC, have required changes in corporate governance practices and generally increased the disclosure requirements of public companies. As a reporting company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses in connection with our public disclosure and other obligations. Based upon SEC regulations currently in effect, we are required to establish, evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. We believe that compliance with the myriad of rules and regulations applicable to reporting companies and related compliance issues will continue to require a significant amount of time and attention from our management.\n 56 \n \nOur stock prices may fluctuate significantly and be highly volatile and this may make it difficult for a stockholder to resell our securities at the volume, prices and times the stockholder finds attractive.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations and be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for a stockholder to resell our securities at the volume, prices and times the stockholder finds attractive. There are many factors that will impact our stock price and trading volume, including, but not limited to, the factors listed above under Risks Related to Our Business Generally,\u201d Risks Related to Our Cell Therapy Product Development Efforts,\u201d Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property,\u201d Risks Related to Government Regulation\u201d and Risks Related to Our Common Stock\u201d.\nStock markets, in general, experience significant price and volume volatility, and the market price of our securities may continue to be subject to such market fluctuations that may be unrelated to our operating performance and prospects. Increased market volatility and fluctuations could result in a substantial decline in the market price of our securities.\nThere may be significant future issuances or resales of our common stock which may materially and adversely dilute stockholders' ownership interest and affect the market price of our securities.\nWe have authorization to issue up to 300,000,000,000 shares of common stock of which, as of March 17, 2021, 3,016,743,991 shares are issued and outstanding. We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock in the future, including securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, we issued warrants for the purchase of an aggregate of 15,226,203,720 shares of our common stock. In addition, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, we issued convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $9,642,418. Such notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at prices related to the market price of our common stock at the time of conversion. Our issuance of additional shares of common stock in the future will dilute the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders.\nPursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, an aggregate of 1,049,726,797 shares of common stock were issued to holders of unsecured claims. Such shares are freely tradeable in the public market, except for shares held by affiliates.\nWe have effective registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act registering an aggregate of 19,955,000 shares of our common stock issuable under our 2010 Equity Participation Plan (the Plan\u201d). As of March 17, 2021, options to purchase 4,879,617 shares of our common stock were outstanding under the Plan. In addition, as of such date, 45,000 shares of common stock were issued as stock grants pursuant to the Plan. The Plan terminated on November 17, 2020 and accordingly no further grants may be made under the Plan. The shares issuable pursuant to the registration statements on Form S-8 will be freely tradable in the public market, except for shares held by affiliates.\nThe sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock, whether directly by us in future offerings or by our existing stockholders in the secondary market, the perception that such issuances or resales could occur or the availability for future issuances or resale of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock could materially and adversely affect the market price of our securities and our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities on attractive terms or at all.\nIn addition, our Board of Directors is authorized to designate and issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval, and we may issue other equity and equity-related securities that are senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, to support operations and growth, and to comply with any future changes in regulatory standards.\n 57 \n \nAnti-takeover provisions and the regulations to which we may be subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to our securityholders.\nWe are incorporated in Delaware. Anti-takeover provisions in Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their securities. Our certificate of incorporation provides that our Board of Directors may issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, without stockholder approval and with such terms, preferences, rights and privileges as the Board of Directors may deem appropriate. These provisions and other factors may hinder or prevent a change in control, even if the change in control would be perceived as beneficial to, or sought by, our other stockholders.\nWe have not filed all periodic reports required to be filed with the SEC; we believe that such failure is making our common stock less difficult to sell.\nWe have not filed our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 or September 30, 2020. We believe that such lack of current public information is making our common stock more difficult to sell.\nOur common stock is classified as a penny stock;\u201d the restrictions of the penny stock regulations of the SEC may result in less liquidity for our common stock.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which define a penny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as therein defined) of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock by a retail customer, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about commissions payable to both the broker/dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Our common stock is classified as a penny stock. As a result of the penny stock restrictions, brokers or potential investors may be reluctant to trade in our securities, which may result in less liquidity for our securities.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nShares of our common stock that we have issued or are issuable upon the exercise of warrants or upon the conversion of convertible debt may be covered by registration statements which permit the public sale of stock. Other holders of shares of common stock that we have issued, including shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants and the conversion of convertible debt, may be entitled to dispose of their shares subject to the requirements of Rule 144 or other applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, the shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the conversion of convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $3,644,279 are subject to certain lock-up restrictions over the 180 day period following the November 16, 2020 effective date of the Plan of Reorganization. As those lock-up restrictions expire during said 180 day period, the shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the conversion of such notes will become eligible for resale in the open market (subject to Rule 144 volume limitations applicable to affiliates), resulting in more shares eligible for sale and potentially causing sales in the market to increase and our stock price to decline. In addition, effective February 17, 2021, certain lock-up restrictions imposed by the Plan of Reorganization with regard to the resale of the 1,049,726,797 shares of common stock issued to holders of unsecured claims expired. The unrestricted eligibility of such shares for resale in the open market (subject to Rule 144 volume limitations applicable to affiliates) could also have a negative effect upon our stock price. Additional sales of a substantial number of our shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our stock.\n ", "item_7_tables": "Table 45: <table> <tr> <td>\nProgram\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Patent Family </td> <td> </td> <td>\nI.D.\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nJurisdiction\n</td> <td> </td>
