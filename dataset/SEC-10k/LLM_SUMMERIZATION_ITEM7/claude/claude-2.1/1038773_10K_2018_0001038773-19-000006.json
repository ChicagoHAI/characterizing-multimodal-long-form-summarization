MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is a discussion of our financial condition at December 31, 2018 and 2017 and our results of operations for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included\nBusiness Overview\nThe Company's business model consists of leveraging capital into assets funded by liabilities. As a general rule capital can be leveraged approximately ten times. The primary source of revenue is interest income from earning assets, namely loans and securities. These liabilities used to fund the assets are primarily deposits. The Company seeks to maximize net interest income, the difference between interest received on earning assets and the amount of interest paid on liabilities. Net interest income to average assets is a key ratio that measures the profitability of the earning assets of the company. Noninterest income is the second source of revenue and primarily consists of customer service fees, gains on the sales of securities and loans, and other noninterest income. Noninterest income to average assets is a ratio that reflects our effectiveness in generating these other forms of revenue. The Company incurs noninterest expenses as result of the operations of its business. Primary expenses are those of employees, occupancy and equipment, professional services, and data processing. The Company seeks to minimize the amount of noninterest expense relative to the amount of total assets; noninterest expense to assets is a key ratio that measures the efficiency of the costs incurred to operate the business.\nExecutive Summary\nThe following is a summary of the Company's financial highlights and significant events during 2018:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Completed two acquisitions during the year which increased assets by approximately $444 million : Tennessee Bancshares the second quarter and Foothills Bancorp in the fourth quarter.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Earnings available to common shareholders increased to $18.1 million and earnings per share increased to $1.46.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Ended 2018 with record high total assets of $2.3 billion, net loans of $1.8 billion, and deposits of $1.9 billion.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net interest margin, taxable equivalent, increased to 4.43 percent 2018 compared to 4.29 percent in 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Efficiency ratio, which is equal to noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income, decreased to 70.7 percent in 2018, compared to 76.0 percent in 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnalysis of Results of Operations\n2018 compared to 2017\nNet income was $18.1 million in 2018, compared to $5.0 million in 2017. Net income available to common shareholders was $18.1 million, or $1.45 per diluted common share, in 2018, compared to $4.8 million, or $0.55 per diluted common share, in 2017. Net interest income to average assets of 3.90 percent in 2018 held steady from in 2017. Noninterest income to average assets of 0.34 percent decreased from 0.42 percent in 2017 as growth in assets exceeded increases in noninterest income. Noninterest expense to average assets decreased from 3.29 percent in 2017 to 3.00 percent in 2018 as the company continued to capture economies of scale following the mergers. The resulting pretax income to average assets was 1.19 percent in 2018 compared to 1.00 percent in 2017. Finally, in 2018 the effective tax rate was 15.2 percent, which was lower than normal due to a tax benefit from options exercised while the rate of 56.2 percent in 2017 was elevated due to a $2.4 million after-tax charge to write down the Company's deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n2017 compared to 2016\nNet income was $5.0 million in 2017 a decrease from $5.8 million in 2016 primarily due to a $2.4 million after-tax charge to write down the Company's deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Net income available to common shareholders was $4.8 million, or $0.55 per diluted common share, in 2017 compared to $4.8 million, or $0.78 per diluted common share, in 2016. Net interest income to average assets of 3.90 percent in 2017 increased from 3.77 percent in 2016 as a result of a higher percentage of average earning assets to average total assets. Noninterest income to average assets of 0.42 percent in 2017 increased slightly from 0.41 percent in 2016 due to higher customer service fees, higher interchange and debit cards fees, and higher other noninterest income. Noninterest expense to average assets increased from 3.20 percent in 2016 to 3.29 percent in 2017 primarily due to $2.4 million in merger expenses. The resulting pretax income to average assets was 1.00 percent in 2017 compared to 0.95 percent in 2016. Finally, the effective tax rate of 56.2 percent in 2017 was elevated due to a $2.4 million after-tax charge to write down the Company's deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 while in 2016 the effective tax rate was 36.70 percent..\nNet Interest Income and Yield Analysis\n2018 compared to 2017\nNet interest income, taxable equivalent, increased to $76.8 million in 2018 from $46.4 million in 2017. The increase in net interest income, taxable equivalent, was the result of a significant increase in earning assets primarily from the mergers but also from organic business activity. Average earning assets increased from $1.1 billion in 2017 to $1.7 billion in 2018. Over this period, average loan balances increased by $592.1 million and average securities balances increased by $33.0 million. In addition, total average interest-bearing deposits increased by $543.1 million. Net interest income to average assets of 3.90 percent in 2018 was unchanged from 3.90 percent in 2017. Net interest margin, taxable equivalent, was 4.43 percent in 2018, compared to 4.29 percent in 2017, with the increase due to higher yields on earning assets. Net interest margin, taxable equivalent, was slightly negatively impacted by an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities from 0.66 percent in 2017 to 1.10 percent in 2018. In 2019 we expect net interest income to average assets and net interest margin, taxable equivalent, to experience pressure as there is the potential for pressure to increase deposit rates as short term rates have continued to increase but do anticipate the effect of rate increases will be mitigated on the income side by increases in yields of our floating rate earning assets.\n2017 compared to 2016\nNet interest income, taxable equivalent, increased to $46.4 million in 2017 from $38.3 million in 2016. The increase in net interest income, taxable equivalent, was the result of a significant increase in earning assets primarily from the merger but also from organic business activity. Average earning assets increased from $944.6 million in 2016 to $1.1 billion in 2017 . Over this period, average loan balances increased by $149.6 million and average securities and interest bearing balances decreased by $17.3 million. In addition, total average interest-bearing deposits increased by $113.8 million. Net interest income to average assets of 3.90 percent in 2017 increased from 3.77 percent in 2016 . Net interest margin, taxable equivalent, was 4.29 percent in 2017 4.06 percent in 2016, with the increase due to higher yields on earning assets.. Net interest margin, taxable equivalent, was slightly negatively impacted by an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities from 0.56 percent in 2016 to 0.66 percent in 2017.\nThe following table summarizes the major components of net interest income and the related yields and costs for the periods presented.\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Noninterest income to average assets of 0.34 percent decreased from 0.42 percent in 2017. Primary drivers of the decrease were a change in the accounting treatment form interchange and debit card transaction fees, which starting in 2018 are shown net of direct costs. In 2018, there were gains of $1.4 million on the sale of mortgage loans, SBA loans and other assets compared to $1.3 million in 2017. Other noninterest income of $2.2 million in 2018 increased from $1.3 million in 2017 primarily due to higher income from bank owned life insurance and higher income from investment operations. In 2018, we expect noninterest income to average assets to increase as a result of increased loan sales from the mortgage unit, higher service charges on deposit accounts, increases in income from investment services, and greater other noninterest income.\n2017 compared to 2016\nNoninterest income totaled $5.0 million in 2017, which was an increase from $4.2 million in 2016. Noninterest income to average assets of 0.42 percent in 2017 increased slightly from 0.41 percent in 2016. Primary drivers of the increase were higher gains higher customer service fees, higher interchange and debit cards fees, and higher other noninterest income. In 2017, there were $1.4 million in customer service fees compared to $1.1 million in 2016 due to higher volumes. Interchange an debit card fees increased from$732 thousand in 2016 to $952 thousand in 2017 due to higher volumes. Other noninterest income of $1.3 million in 2017 increased from $986 thousand in 2016 primarily due to increased revenue as a result of the merger.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table provides a summary of noninterest expense for the periods presented.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net occupancy and equipment expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FDIC insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>606\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreclosed assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>616\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data processing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of other intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software as services contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 compared to 2017\nNoninterest expense totaled $59.0 million in 2018 compared to $39.1 million in 2017. Noninterest expense to average assets decreased from 3.29 percent in 2017 to 3.00 percent in 2018. Salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, and other noninterest expense categories in 2018 were all higher as a result of post-merger expenses including ten additional months of Capstone expenses, seven additional months of Tennessee Bancshares expenses, and two additional months of Foothills expenses. In 2019, we expect noninterest expense to average assets to increase as anticipated increases in merger expenses offset reductions in core operating expenses.\n2017 compared to 2016\nNoninterest expense totaled $39.1 million in 2017 compared to $32.5 million in 2016 . Noninterest expense to average assets increased from 3.20 percent in 2016 to 3.29 percent in 2017. Salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, and other noninterest expense categories in 2017 were all higher as a result of two full months of post-merger expense. In 2017 noninterest expense was also elevated by $2.4 million of merger expenses, compared to none in 2016.\nIncome Taxes\n2018 compared to 2017\nIn 2018, income tax expense totaled $3.2 million compared to $6.4 million in 2017. In 2018 the effective tax rate was 15.2 percent, which was lower than normal due to a tax benefit from options exercised in the prior period while the rated of 56.2 percent in 2017 was elevated due to a $2.4 million after-tax charge to write down the Company's deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In 2019, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 25 percent.\n2017 compared to 2016\nIn 2017, income tax expense totaled $6.4 million compared to $3.4 million in 2016. The effective tax rate of 56.2 percent in 2017 was elevated due to a $2.4 million after-tax charge to reduce the value of the Company's deferred tax assets as a result of the tax law signed in December compared to 36.7 percent in 2016\nLoan Portfolio Composition\nThe Company had total net loans outstanding, including organic and purchased loans, of approximately $1.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2017. Loans secured by real estate, consisting of commercial or residential property, are the principal component of our loan portfolio. We do not generally originate traditional long-term residential mortgages for our portfolio but we do originate and hold traditional second mortgage residential real estate loans, adjustable rate mortgages and home equity lines of credit. Even if the principal purpose of the loan is not to finance real estate, when reasonable, we attempt to obtain a security interest in the real estate in addition to any other available collateral to increase the likelihood of ultimate repayment or collection of the loan.\nOrganic Loans\nOur net organic loans increased $356.6 million, or 44.9 percent to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2018, from December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the mergers. Our goal of streamlining the credit process has improved our efficiency and is a competitive advantage in many of our markets. In addition, continued training and recruiting of experienced loan officers has provided us with the opportunity to close larger and more complex deals than we historically have. Finally, the overall business environment continues to rebound from recessionary conditions. Organic loans include loans which were originally purchased non-credit impaired loans but have been renewed.\nPurchased Loans\nPurchased non-credit impaired loans of $584.5 million at December 31, 2018 increased by $93.6 million from December 31, 2017 as a result of the mergers. Also during 2018, our purchased credit impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans increased by $1.4 million to $34.2 million at December 31, 2018. The activity within the purchased credit impaired loans will be impacted by how quickly these loans are resolved and/or our future acquisition activity.\nThe following tables summarize the composition

amounts due with respect to principal and interest are not received within 30 days of the contractual due date. Loans are generally classified as nonaccrual if they are past due for a period of 90 days or more, unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection. If a loan or a portion of a loan is classified as doubtful or as partially charged off, the loan is generally classified as nonaccrual. Loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than 90 days may also be classified as nonaccrual if repayment in full of principal and interest is in doubt. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time, and there is a sustained period of repayment performance of interest and principal by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms.\nPCI loans with common risk characteristics are grouped in pools at acquisition. These loans are evaluated for accrual status at the pool level rather than the individual loan level and performance is based on our ability to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows rather than a borrower's ability to repay contractual loan amounts. Since we are able to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows on the Company's PCI loan pools, none of these loans have been identified as nonaccrual. However, PCI loans included in pools are identified as nonperforming if they are past due 90 days or more at acquisition or become 90 days or more past due after acquisition. The past due status is determined based on the contractual terms of the individual loans.\nWhile a loan is classified as nonaccrual and the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is doubtful, collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to the principal outstanding, except in the case of loans with scheduled amortizations where the payment is generally applied to the oldest payment due. When the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is expected, interest income may be recognized on a cash basis. In the case where a nonaccrual loan had been partially charged off, recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate. Receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge-offs have been fully recovered.\nAssets acquired as a result of foreclosure are recorded at estimated fair value in foreclosed assets. Any excess of cost over estimated fair value at the time of foreclosure is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Valuations are periodically performed on these properties, and any subsequent write-downs are charged to earnings. Routine maintenance and other holding costs are included in noninterest expense.\nLoans, excluding pooled PCI loans, are classified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDR\u201d) by the Company when certain modifications are made to the loan terms and concessions are granted to the borrowers due to financial difficulty experienced by those borrowers. The Company grants concessions by (1) reduction of the stated interest rate for the remaining original life of the debt or (2) extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk. The Company does not generally grant concessions through forgiveness of principal or accrued interest. The Company's policy with respect to accrual of interest on loans restructured in a TDR follows relevant supervisory guidance. That is, if a borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous loan terms and shows capacity to perform under the restructured loan terms, continued accrual of interest at the restructured interest rate is likely. If a borrower was materially delinquent on payments prior to the restructuring but shows the capacity to meet the restructured loan terms, the loan will likely continue as nonaccrual until there is demonstrated performance under new terms. Lastly, if the borrower does not perform under the restructured terms, the loan is placed on non-accrual status. The Company closely monitors these loans and ceases accruing interest on them if we believe that the borrowers may not continue performing based on the restructured note terms.\nPCI loans that were classified as TDRs prior to acquisition are not classified as TDRs by the Company after the acquisition date. Subsequent modification of a PCI loan accounted for in a pool that would otherwise meet the definition of a TDR is not reported, or accounted for, as a TDR since pooled PCI loans are excluded from the scope of TDR accounting. A PCI loan not accounted for in a pool would be reported, and accounted for, as a TDR if modified in a manner that meets the definition of a TDR after the acquisition date.\nNonperforming loans as a percentage of gross loans, net of deferred fees, was 0.18 percent as of December 31, 2018, compared to 0.25 percent as of December 31, 2017. Total nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets as of December 31, 2018 totaled 0.25 percent compared to 0.34 percent as of December 31, 2017. Acquired PCI loans that are included in loan pools are reclassified at acquisition to accrual status and thus are not included as nonperforming assets unless they are 90 days or greater past due. In 2018, there was $124 thousand in interest income recognized on nonaccrual and restructured loans compared to the $222 thousand in gross interest income that would have been recognized if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's nonperforming assets as of December 31 for the periods presented.\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accruing loans past due 90 days or more (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreclosed assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructured loans not included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Balances include PCI loans past due 90 days or more that are grouped in pools which accrue interest based on pool yields.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPotential Problem Loans\nAt December 31, 2018 problem loans amounted to approximately $784.0 thousand or 0.04 percent of total loans outstanding. Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming loans, represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by the Bank's primary regulators, for loans classified as substandard or worse, but not considered nonperforming loans.\nAllocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nWe maintain the allowance at a level that we deem appropriate to adequately cover the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our allowance for loan losses was $8.3 million and $5.9 million, respectively, which we deemed to be adequate at each of the respective dates. The increase in the allowance for loan losses in 2018 as compared to 2017 is primarily the result of increases in organic loan growth offset slightly by improving overall credit metrics within our portfolio. Our allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans has increased from 0.44 percent at December 31, 2017 to 0.47 percent at December 31, 2018. As a percentage of organic loans the allowance for loan losses decreased slightly from 0.73 percent at December 31, 2017 to 0.71 percent at December 31, 2018. In 2019, we expect the allowance to organic loans to remain in the range of 0.70 to 0.80 percent.\nOur purchased loans were recorded at fair value upon acquisition. The fair value adjustments on the performing purchased loans will be accreted into income over the life of the loans. At December 31, 2018, the remaining accretable yield was approximately $7.1 million. Also at the end of 2018, the balance on PCI loans was $48.4 million and the carrying value was $34.2 million, for a net difference of $14.2 million in discounts. These loans are subject to the same allowance methodology as our legacy portfolio. The calculated allowance is compared to the remaining fair value discount to determine if additional provisioning should be recognized. At December 31, 2018, there was no allowance on PCI loans. The judgments and estimates associated with our allowance determination are described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nThe following table sets forth, based on our best estimate, the allocation of the allowance to types of loans as well as the unallocated portion as of December 31 for each of the past five years and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans (in thousands):\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate-mortgage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer real estate-mortgage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction and land development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total allowance for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the overall allowance for loan losses is due to the increased balance of organic loans offset by improvements of our loan portfolio and the reduction of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs, which is largely influenced by the overall improvement in the economies in our market areas. The allocation by category is determined based on the assigned risk rating, if applicable, and environmental factors applicable to each category of loans. For impaired loans, those loans are reviewed for a specific allowance allocation. Specific valuation allowances related to impaired loans were approximately $534 thousand at December 31, 2018, compared to $445 thousand at December 31, 2017. Additional information on the allocation of the allowance between performing and impaired loans is provided in Note 4-Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe following is a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses for each of the years in the five-year period ended December 31, 2018 and

</tr>\n</table>\nWe assess the adequacy of the allowance at the end of each calendar quarter. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolios, past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, the views of the Bank's regulators, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay (including the timing of future payments), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change.\nInvestment Portfolio\nOur investment portfolio which is carried at fair market value, consisting primarily of Federal agency bonds, mortgage-backed securities, state and municipal securities and other debt securities amounted to $201.7 million and $151.9 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This increase was a result of purchasing additional investments from liquidity received through the sale of the investment portfolios after the two mergers. In 2016, the investment portfolio amounted to $131.0 million million and it increased in 2017 to $151.9 million as a result purchasing additional investments from liquidity received through the sale of the investment portfolios after the Capstone merger. Our investment to asset ratio has decreased from 12.1 percent at December 31, 2016, to 8.8 percent at December 31, 2017, and then increased slightly to 8.9 percent at December 31, 2018. Over the last several years we have reduced the ratio of investments to total assets and the absolute level of investment securities on our balance sheet as we have allocated more funding to loans.

The Company provides a range of deposit services to businesses and individuals, including noninterest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, Individual Retirement Accounts (\"IRAs\") and certificates of deposit (\"CDs\"). These accounts generally earn interest at rates the Company establishes based on market factors and the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs. The establishment or continuity of a core deposit relationship can be a factor in loan pricing decisions. While the Company's primary focus is on establishing customer relationships to attract core deposits, at times, the Company uses brokered deposits and other wholesale deposits to supplement its funding sources. As of December 31, 2018, brokered deposits represented approximately 12.6 percent of total deposits.\nThe composition of the deposit portfolio, by category, as of December 31, 2018 was as follows: 33.8 percent in time deposits, 33.4 percent in money market and savings, 16.2 percent in interest-bearing demand deposit, and 16.6 percent in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. The composition of the deposit portfolio, by category, as of December 31, 2017 was as follows: 30.8 percent in time deposits, 37.8 percent in money market and savings, 16.1 percent in interest-bearing demand deposit, and 15.3 percent in noninterest-bearing demand deposits.\nThe following table summarizes the average balances outstanding and average interest rates for each major category of deposits for 2018 and 2017.\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest-bearing demand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>285,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>172,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing demand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>242,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Money market and savings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>601,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>342,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.51\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>536,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>329,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.98\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total average deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,667,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,011,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2018 the overall mix of average deposits has shifted to a higher percentage of noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing demand accounts, and time deposits with a reduction in the percentage of deposits held in money market and savings deposits. The Company believes its deposit product offerings are properly structured to attract and retain core low-cost deposit relationships. The average cost of deposits was 0.86 percent in 2018 compared to 0.54 percent in 2017 as deposit costs increased with rising interest rates.\nTotal deposits as of December 31, 2018 were $1,922.0 million, which was an increase of $483.4 million from December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had outstanding time deposits under $100,000 of $309.3 million, time deposits over $100,000 of $605.3 million, and a time deposit fair value adjustment of $759 thousand. The following table summarizes the maturities of time deposits $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2018.\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining maturity:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months or less\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three to six months\n</td> <td>99,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Six to twelve months\n</td> <td>217,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>More than twelve months\n</td> <td>190,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>605,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBorrowings\nThe Company uses short-term borrowings and long-term debt to provide both funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital for debt at the Company level which can be downstreamed as Tier 1 capital to the Bank. Short-term borrowings totaled $11.2 million December 31, 2018, and consisted primarily of federal funds purchased. Short-term borrowings totaled $33.6 million at December 31, 2017, and consisted entirely of federal funds purchased. Short-term borrowings totaled $18.5 million at December 31, 2016, and consisted of $5.0 million in FHLB advances maturing within twelve months and $13.5 million federal funds purchased. Long-term debt totaled $39.2 million at December 31, 2018 and consisted of subordinated debt. Long-term debt totaled $10 million at December 31, 2017 and consisted of one line of credit that matures in 2022. There was no long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2016.\nCapital Resources\nThe Company uses leverage analysis to examine the potential of the institution to increase assets and liabilities using the current capital base. The key measurements included in this analysis are the Banks' Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, leverage and total capital ratios. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our capital ratios, including our Banks' capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements. From time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank subsidiary. We believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our Bank, if necessary. Additional information on capital is provided in Note 14-Regulatory Matters to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $333.9 million of pre-approved but unused lines of credit and $12.2 million of standby letters of credit. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon. The total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If needed to fund these outstanding commitments, the Bank has the ability to liquidate Federal funds sold or securities available-for-sale, or on a short-term basis to borrow and purchase Federal funds from other financial institutions. Additional information about our off-balance sheet risk exposure is presented in Note 13-Commitments and Contingencies to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nMarket Risk and Liquidity Risk Management\nThe Bank's Asset Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d) is responsible for making decisions regarding liquidity and funding solutions based upon approved liquidity, loan, capital and investment policies. The ALCO must consider interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management when rendering a decision on funding solutions and loan pricing. To assist in this process the Bank has contracted with an independent third party to prepare quarterly reports that summarize several key asset-liability measurements. In addition, the third party will also provide recommendations to the Bank's ALCO regarding future balance sheet structure, earnings and liquidity strategies. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nInterest rate sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates. ALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. The primary measurements we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity are an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity model. These measurements are used in conjunction with competitive pricing analysis and are further described below.\nEarnings Simulation Model We believe interest rate risk is effectively measured by our earnings simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with simulated forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and 24 months. To limit interest rate risk, we have guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in instantaneous changes to interest rates. We also periodically monitor simulations based on various rate scenarios such as non-parallel shifts in market interest rates over time. For changes up or down in rates from our flat interest rate forecast over the next 12 and 24 months, limits in the decline in net interest income are as follows:\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maximum Percentage Decline in Net Interest\nIncome from the Budgeted or Base Case\nProjection of Net Interest Income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Next 12\nMonths\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Next 24\nMonths\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>An instantaneous, parallel rate increase or decrease of the following at the\nbeginning of the first quarter:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u00b1 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u00b1 200 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u00b1 300 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u00b1 400 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe were in compliance with our earnings simulation model policies as of December 31, 2018, indicating what we believe to be a slightly asset sensitive profile.\nEconomic Value of Equity Our economic value of equity model measures the extent that estimated economic values of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items will change as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case economic value of equity.\nTo help monitor our related risk, we've established the following policy limits regarding simulated changes in our economic value of equity:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Instantaneous, Parallel Change in Prevailing\nInterest Rates Equal to\n</td> <td>Maximum Percentage Decline in Economic Value of Equity from\nthe Economic Value of Equity at Currently Prevailing Interest Rates\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u00b1100 basis points\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u00b1200 basis points\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u00b1300 basis points\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u00b1400 basis points\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2018, our model results indicated that we were within these policy limits.\nEach of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates.\nIn addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. Our ALCO reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nThe purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand, deposit withdrawals, and our other needs. Traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits. A bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations. Funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective. The liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions.\nChanges in interest rates also affect our liquidity position. We currently price deposits in response to market rates and intend to continue this policy. If deposits are not priced in response to market rates, a loss of deposits could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position.\nScheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly, being influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions and competition. Additionally, debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity. We attempt to price our deposit products to meet our asset/liability objectives consistent with local market conditions. Our ALCO is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs. Our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nAs a financial institution, we have an asset and liability make-up that is distinctly different from that of an entity with substantial investments in plant and inventory, because the major portions of a commercial bank's assets are monetary in nature. As a result, our performance may be significantly influenced by changes in interest rates. Although we, and the banking industry, are more affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation in the prices of goods and services, inflation is a factor that may influence interest rates. However, the frequency and magnitude of interest rate fluctuations do not necessarily coincide with changes in the general inflation rate. Inflation does affect operating expenses in that personnel expenses and the cost of supplies and outside services tend to increase more during periods of high inflation.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company has identified accounting policies that are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate its reported financial results and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Management has reviewed the following critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. These policies along with a brief discussion of the material implications of the uncertainties of each policy are below. For a full description of these critical accounting policies, see Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nAllowance for loan losses - In establishing the allowance we take into account reserves required for impaired loans, historical charge-offs for loan types, and a variety of qualitative factors including economic outlook, portfolio concentrations, and changes in portfolio credit quality. Many of the qualitative factors are measurable but there is also a level of subjective assumptions. If those assumptions change it could have a material impact on the level of the allowance required and as a result the earnings of the Company. As an example an increase in the amount of the reserve to organic loans of 0.05 percent in 2018 would have resulted in a reduction of approximately 3 percent in pre-tax income.\nFair values for acquired assets and assumed liabilities- Assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the net estimated fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities is allocated to identifiable intangible assets with the remaining excess allocated to goodwill. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset's fair value. As of December 31, 2018 there was approximately $66.1 million in goodwill. The Company has not identified any triggering events that would indicate potential impairment of goodwill.\nCash flow estimates on purchased credit-impaired loans- Purchase credit impaired loans do not have traditional loan yields and interest income; instead they have accretable yield and accretion. Any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable discount and is recognized in interest income as accretion over the remaining life of the loan when there is reasonable expectation about the amount and timing of such cash flows. The amount expected to be accreted divided by the accretable discount is the accretable yield. Cash flow estimates are re-evaluated quarterly. If the estimated cash flows increase then the accretable yield over the life of the loan increases. If, however, the estimated cash flows decrease then impairment is generally recognized immediately. As an example a loan with a fair value of $200,000 with estimated cash flows of $300,000 over five years would have an accretable yield of approximately 8.2 percent and would have accretion of approximately $16,400 a year. If the cash flow estimate changed to $350,000 the accretable yield would increase to approximately 10.1 percent and the yearly accretion recognized into income would be approximately $20,300. If, however, the cash flow estimate changed to $250,000 the Company would generally recognize an impairment of $50,000 immediately, instead of reducing the accretion over the life of the loan.\nValuation of foreclosed assets - Foreclosed assets are initially recorded at fair value less selling costs. If the fair value decreases the assets are written down. As of December 31, 2018, there was approximately $2.5 million in foreclosed assets carried at a 23.3 percent discount to appraisal values.\nValuation of deferred tax assets- Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination. The determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date and is subject to management's judgment. Deferred tax assets may be reduced by deferred tax liabilities and a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of evidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2018, there were approximately $5.6 million in net deferred tax assets.\nEvaluation of investment securities for other than temporary impairment- We evaluate investment securities for other than temporary impairment taking into account if we do not have the intent to sell a debt security prior to recovery and it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery, the security would not be considered other than temporarily impaired unless a credit loss has occurred in the security. Temporary impairments are recognized on the balance sheet in other comprehensive income / loss. If a security becomes permanently impaired the impairment expense would be recognized and reduce earnings. As of December 31, 2018, there was approximately $3.0 million in gross unrealized losses on investment securities that were classified as temporarily impaired.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is a discussion of our financial condition at December 31, 2018 and 2017 and our results of operations for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included\nBusiness Overview\nThe Company's business model consists of leveraging capital into assets funded by liabilities. As a general rule capital can be leveraged approximately ten times. The primary source of revenue is interest income from earning assets, namely loans and securities. These liabilities used to fund the assets are primarily deposits. The Company seeks to maximize net interest income, the difference between interest received on earning assets and the amount of interest paid on liabilities. Net interest income to average assets is a key ratio that measures the profitability of the earning assets of the company. Noninterest income is the second source of revenue and primarily consists of customer service fees, gains on the sales of securities and loans, and other noninterest income. Noninterest income to average assets is a ratio that reflects our effectiveness in generating these other forms of revenue. The Company incurs noninterest expenses as result of the operations of its business. Primary expenses are those of employees, occupancy and equipment, professional services, and data processing. The Company seeks to minimize the amount of noninterest expense relative to the amount of total assets; noninterest expense to assets is a key ratio that measures the efficiency of the costs incurred to operate the business.\nExecutive Summary\nThe following is a summary of the Company's financial highlights and significant events during 2018:\n \u2022 Completed two acquisitions during the year which increased assets by approximately $444 million : Tennessee Bancshares the second quarter and Foothills Bancorp in the fourth quarter. \n \u2022 Earnings available to common shareholders increased to $18.1 million and earnings per share increased to $1.46. \n \u2022 Ended 2018 with record high total assets of $2.3 billion, net loans of $1.8 billion, and deposits of $1.9 billion. \n \u2022 Net interest margin, taxable equivalent, increased to 4.43 percent 2018 compared to 4.29 percent in 2017. \n \u2022 Efficiency ratio, which is equal to noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income, decreased to 70.7 percent in 2018, compared to 76.0 percent in 2017. \nAnalysis of Results of Operations\n2018 compared to 2017\nNet income was $18.1 million in 2018, compared to $5.0 million in 2017. Net income available to common shareholders was $18.1 million, or $1.45 per diluted common share, in 2018, compared to $4.8 million, or $0.55 per diluted common share, in 2017. Net interest income to average assets of 3.90 percent in 2018 held steady from in 2017. Noninterest income to average assets of 0.34 percent decreased from 0.42 percent in 2017 as growth in assets exceeded increases in noninterest income. Noninterest expense to average assets decreased from 3.29 percent in 2017 to 3.00 percent in 2018 as the company continued to capture economies of scale following the mergers. The resulting pretax income to average assets was 1.19 percent in 2018 compared to 1.00 percent in 2017. Finally, in 2018 the effective tax rate was 15.2 percent, which was lower than normal due to a tax benefit from options exercised while the rate of 56.2 percent in 2017 was elevated due to a $2.4 million after-tax charge to write down the Company's deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n2017 compared to 2016\nNet income was $5.0 million in 2017 a decrease from $5.8 million in 2016 primarily due to a $2.4 million after-tax charge to write down the Company's deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Net income available to common shareholders was $4.8 million, or $0.55 per diluted common share, in 2017 compared to $4.8 million, or $0.78 per diluted common share, in 2016. Net interest income to average assets of 3.90 percent in 2017 increased from 3.77 percent in 2016 as a result of a higher percentage of average earning assets to average total assets. Noninterest income to average assets of 0.42 percent in 2017 increased slightly from 0.41 percent in 2016 due to higher customer service fees, higher interchange and debit cards fees, and higher other noninterest income. Noninterest expense to average assets increased from 3.20 percent in 2016 to 3.29 percent in 2017 primarily due to $2.4 million in merger expenses. The resulting pretax income to average assets was 1.00 percent in 2017 compared to 0.95 percent in 2016. Finally, the effective tax rate of 56.2 percent in 2017 was elevated due to a $2.4 million after-tax charge to write down the Company's deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 while in 2016 the effective tax rate was 36.70 percent..\nNet Interest Income and Yield Analysis\n2018 compared to 2017\nNet interest income, taxable equivalent, increased to $76.8 million in 2018 from $46.4 million in 2017. The increase in net interest income, taxable equivalent, was the result of a significant increase in earning assets primarily from the mergers but also from organic business activity. Average earning assets increased from $1.1 billion in 2017 to $1.7 billion in 2018. Over this period, average loan balances increased by $592.1 million and average securities balances increased by $33.0 million. In addition, total average interest-bearing deposits increased by $543.1 million. Net interest income to average assets of 3.90 percent in 2018 was unchanged from 3.90 percent in 2017. Net interest margin, taxable equivalent, was 4.43 percent in 2018, compared to 4.29 percent in 2017, with the increase due to higher yields on earning assets. Net interest margin, taxable equivalent, was slightly negatively impacted by an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities from 0.66 percent in 2017 to 1.10 percent in 2018. In 2019 we expect net interest income to average assets and net interest margin, taxable equivalent, to experience pressure as there is the potential for pressure to increase deposit rates as short term rates have continued to increase but do anticipate the effect of rate increases will be mitigated on the income side by increases in yields of our floating rate earning assets.\n2017 compared to 2016\nNet interest income, taxable equivalent, increased to $46.4 million in 2017 from $38.3 million in 2016. The increase in net interest income, taxable equivalent, was the result of a significant increase in earning assets primarily from the merger but also from organic business activity. Average earning assets increased from $944.6 million in 2016 to $1.1 billion in 2017 . Over this period, average loan balances increased by $149.6 million and average securities and interest bearing balances decreased by $17.3 million. In addition, total average interest-bearing deposits increased by $113.8 million. Net interest income to average assets of 3.90 percent in 2017 increased from 3.77 percent in 2016 . Net interest margin, taxable equivalent, was 4.29 percent in 2017 4.06 percent in 2016, with the increase due to higher yields on earning assets.. Net interest margin, taxable equivalent, was slightly negatively impacted by an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities from 0.56 percent in 2016 to 0.66 percent in 2017.\nThe following

The taxable-equivalent adjustment was $180 thousand, $90 thousand and $55 thousand for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \nChanges in net interest income are attributed to either changes in average balances (volume change) or changes in average rates (rate change) for earning assets and sources of funds on which interest is received or paid.. Volume change is calculated as change in volume times the previous rate while rate change is change in rate times the previous volume.

Noninterest income to average assets of 0.34 percent decreased from 0.42 percent in 2017. Primary drivers of the decrease were a change in the accounting treatment form interchange and debit card transaction fees, which starting in 2018 are shown net of direct costs. In 2018, there were gains of $1.4 million on the sale of mortgage loans, SBA loans and other assets compared to $1.3 million in 2017. Other noninterest income of $2.2 million in 2018 increased from $1.3 million in 2017 primarily due to higher income from bank owned life insurance and higher income from investment operations. In 2018, we expect noninterest income to average assets to increase as a result of increased loan sales from the mortgage unit, higher service charges on deposit accounts, increases in income from investment services, and greater other noninterest income.\n2017 compared to 2016\nNoninterest income totaled $5.0 million in 2017, which was an increase from $4.2 million in 2016. Noninterest income to average assets of 0.42 percent in 2017 increased slightly from 0.41 percent in 2016. Primary drivers of the increase were higher gains higher customer service fees, higher interchange and debit cards fees, and higher other noninterest income. In 2017, there were $1.4 million in customer service fees compared to $1.1 million in 2016 due to higher volumes. Interchange an debit card fees increased from$732 thousand in 2016 to $952 thousand in 2017 due to higher volumes. Other noninterest income of $1.3 million in 2017 increased from $986 thousand in 2016 primarily due to increased revenue as a result of the merger.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table provides a summary of noninterest expense for the periods presented.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net occupancy and equipment expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FDIC insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>606\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreclosed assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>616\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data processing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of other intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software as services contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 compared to 2017\nNoninterest expense totaled $59.0 million in 2018 compared to $39.1 million in 2017. Noninterest expense to average assets decreased from 3.29 percent in 2017 to 3.00 percent in 2018. Salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, and other noninterest expense categories in 2018 were all higher as a result of post-merger expenses including ten additional months of Capstone expenses, seven additional months of Tennessee Bancshares expenses, and two additional months of Foothills expenses. In 2019, we expect noninterest expense to average assets to increase as anticipated increases in merger expenses offset reductions in core operating expenses.\n2017 compared to 2016\nNoninterest expense totaled $39.1 million in 2017 compared to $32.5 million in 2016 . Noninterest expense to average assets increased from 3.20 percent in 2016 to 3.29 percent in 2017. Salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, and other noninterest expense categories in 2017 were all higher as a result of two full months of post-merger expense. In 2017 noninterest expense was also elevated by $2.4 million of merger expenses, compared to none in 2016.\nIncome Taxes\n2018 compared to 2017\nIn 2018, income tax expense totaled $3.2 million compared to $6.4 million in 2017. In 2018 the effective tax rate was 15.2 percent, which was lower than normal due to a tax benefit from options exercised in the prior period while the rated of 56.2 percent in 2017 was elevated due to a $2.4 million after-tax charge to write down the Company's deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In 2019, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 25 percent.\n2017 compared to 2016\nIn 2017, income tax expense totaled $6.4 million compared to $3.4 million in 2016. The effective tax rate of 56.2 percent in 2017 was elevated due to a $2.4 million after-tax charge to reduce the value of the Company's deferred tax assets as a result of the tax law signed in December compared to 36.7 percent in 2016\nLoan Portfolio Composition\nThe Company had total net loans outstanding, including organic and purchased loans, of approximately $1.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2017. Loans secured by real estate, consisting of commercial or residential property, are the principal component of our loan portfolio. We do not generally originate traditional long-term residential mortgages for our portfolio but we do originate and hold traditional second mortgage residential real estate loans, adjustable rate mortgages and home equity lines of credit. Even if the principal purpose of the loan is not to finance real estate, when reasonable, we attempt to obtain a security interest in the real estate in addition to any other available collateral to increase the likelihood of ultimate repayment or collection of the loan.\nOrganic Loans\nOur net organic loans increased $356.6 million, or 44.9 percent to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2018, from December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the mergers. Our goal of streamlining the credit process has improved our efficiency and is a competitive advantage in many of our markets. In addition, continued training and recruiting of experienced loan officers has provided us with the opportunity to close larger and more complex deals than we historically have. Finally, the overall business environment continues to rebound from recessionary conditions. Organic loans include loans which were originally purchased non-credit impaired loans but have been renewed.\nPurchased Loans\nPurchased non-credit impaired loans of $584.5 million at December 31, 2018 increased by $93.6 million from December 31, 2017 as a result of the mergers. Also during 2018, our purchased credit impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans increased by $1.4 million to $34.2 million at December 31, 2018. The activity within the purchased credit impaired loans will be impacted by how quickly these loans are resolved and/or our future acquisition activity.\nThe following tables summarize the composition

amounts due with respect to principal and interest are not received within 30 days of the contractual due date. Loans are generally classified as nonaccrual if they are past due for a period of 90 days or more, unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection. If a loan or a portion of a loan is classified as doubtful or as partially charged off, the loan is generally classified as nonaccrual. Loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than 90 days may also be classified as nonaccrual if repayment in full of principal and interest is in doubt. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time, and there is a sustained period of repayment performance of interest and principal by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms.\nPCI loans with common risk characteristics are grouped in pools at acquisition. These loans are evaluated for accrual status at the pool level rather than the individual loan level and performance is based on our ability to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows rather than a borrower's ability to repay contractual loan amounts. Since we are able to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows on the Company's PCI loan pools, none of these loans have been identified as nonaccrual. However, PCI loans included in pools are identified as nonperforming if they are past due 90 days or more at acquisition or become 90 days or more past due after acquisition. The past due status is determined based on the contractual terms of the individual loans.\nWhile a loan is classified as nonaccrual and the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is doubtful, collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to the principal outstanding, except in the case of loans with scheduled amortizations where the payment is generally applied to the oldest payment due. When the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is expected, interest income may be recognized on a cash basis. In the case where a nonaccrual loan had been partially charged off, recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate. Receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge-offs have been fully recovered.\nAssets acquired as a result of foreclosure are recorded at estimated fair value in foreclosed assets. Any excess of cost over estimated fair value at the time of foreclosure is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Valuations are periodically performed on these properties, and any subsequent write-downs are charged to earnings. Routine maintenance and other holding costs are included in noninterest expense.\nLoans, excluding pooled PCI loans, are classified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDR\u201d) by the Company when certain modifications are made to the loan terms and concessions are granted to the borrowers due to financial difficulty experienced by those borrowers. The Company grants concessions by (1) reduction of the stated interest rate for the remaining original life of the debt or (2) extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk. The Company does not generally grant concessions through forgiveness of principal or accrued interest. The Company's policy with respect to accrual of interest on loans restructured in a TDR follows relevant supervisory guidance. That is, if a borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous loan terms and shows capacity to perform under the restructured loan terms, continued accrual of interest at the restructured interest rate is likely. If a borrower was materially delinquent on payments prior to the restructuring but shows the capacity to meet the restructured loan terms, the loan will likely continue as nonaccrual until there is demonstrated performance under new terms. Lastly, if the borrower does not perform under the restructured terms, the loan is placed on non-accrual status. The Company closely monitors these loans and ceases accruing interest on them if we believe that the borrowers may not continue performing based on the restructured note terms.\nPCI loans that were classified as TDRs prior to acquisition are not classified as TDRs by the Company after the acquisition date. Subsequent modification of a PCI loan accounted for in a pool that would otherwise meet the definition of a TDR is not reported, or accounted for, as a TDR since pooled PCI loans are excluded from the scope of TDR accounting. A PCI loan not accounted for in a pool would be reported, and accounted for, as a TDR if modified in a manner that meets the definition of a TDR after the acquisition date.\nNonperforming loans as a percentage of gross loans, net of deferred fees, was 0.18 percent as of December 31, 2018, compared to 0.25 percent as of December 31, 2017. Total nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets as of December 31, 2018 totaled 0.25 percent compared to 0.34 percent as of December 31, 2017. Acquired PCI loans that are included in loan pools are reclassified at acquisition to accrual status and thus are not included as nonperforming assets unless they are 90 days or greater past due. In 2018, there was $124 thousand in interest income recognized on nonaccrual and restructured loans compared to the $222 thousand in gross interest income that would have been recognized if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's nonperforming assets as of December 31 for the periods presented.\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accruing loans past due 90 days or more (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreclosed assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructured loans not included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Balances include PCI loans past due 90 days or more that are grouped in pools which accrue interest based on pool yields. \nPotential Problem Loans\nAt December 31, 2018 problem loans amounted to approximately $784.0 thousand or 0.04 percent of total loans outstanding. Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming loans, represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by the Bank's primary regulators, for loans classified as substandard or worse, but not considered nonperforming loans.\nAllocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nWe maintain the allowance at a level that we deem appropriate to adequately cover the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our allowance for loan losses was $8.3 million and $5.9 million, respectively, which we deemed to be adequate at each of the respective dates. The increase in the allowance for loan losses in 2018 as compared to 2017 is primarily the result of increases in organic loan growth offset slightly by improving overall credit metrics within our portfolio. Our allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans has increased from 0.44 percent at December 31, 2017 to 0.47 percent at December 31, 2018. As a percentage of organic loans the allowance for loan losses decreased slightly from 0.73 percent at December 31, 2017 to 0.71 percent at December 31, 2018. In 2019, we expect the allowance to organic loans to remain in the range of 0.70 to 0.80 percent.\nOur purchased loans were recorded at fair value upon acquisition. The fair value adjustments on the performing purchased loans will be accreted into income over the life of the loans. At December 31, 2018, the remaining accretable yield was approximately $7.1 million. Also at the end of 2018, the balance on PCI loans was $48.4 million and the carrying value was $34.2 million, for a net difference of $14.2 million in discounts. These loans are subject to the same allowance methodology as our legacy portfolio. The calculated allowance is compared to the remaining fair value discount to determine if additional provisioning should be recognized. At December 31, 2018, there was no allowance on PCI loans. The judgments and estimates associated with our allowance determination are described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nThe following table sets forth, based on our best estimate, the allocation of the allowance to types of loans as well as the unallocated portion as of December 31 for each of the past five years and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans (in thousands):\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate-mortgage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer real estate-mortgage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction and land development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total allowance for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the overall allowance for loan losses is due to the increased balance of organic loans offset by improvements of our loan portfolio and the reduction of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs, which is largely influenced by the overall improvement in the economies in our market areas. The allocation by category is determined based on the assigned risk rating, if applicable, and environmental factors applicable to each category of loans. For impaired loans, those loans are reviewed for a specific allowance allocation. Specific valuation allowances related to impaired loans were approximately $534 thousand at December 31, 2018, compared to $445 thousand at December 31, 2017. Additional information on the allocation of the allowance between performing and impaired loans is provided in Note 4-Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe following is a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses for each of the years in the five-year period ended December 31, 2018 and

</tr>\n</table>\nWe assess the adequacy of the allowance at the end of each calendar quarter. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolios, past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, the views of the Bank's regulators, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay (including the timing of future payments), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change.\nInvestment Portfolio\nOur investment portfolio which is carried at fair market value, consisting primarily of Federal agency bonds, mortgage-backed securities, state and municipal securities and other debt securities amounted to $201.7 million and $151.9 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This increase was a result of purchasing additional investments from liquidity received through the sale of the investment portfolios after the two mergers. In 2016, the investment portfolio amounted to $131.0 million million and it increased in 2017 to $151.9 million as a result purchasing additional investments from liquidity received through the sale of the investment portfolios after the Capstone merger. Our investment to asset ratio has decreased from 12.1 percent at December 31, 2016, to 8.8 percent at December 31, 2017, and then increased slightly to 8.9 percent at December 31, 2018. Over the last several years we have reduced the ratio of investments to total assets and the absolute level of investment securities on our balance sheet as we have allocated more funding to loans. Our investment portfolio serves many purposes including serving as a potential liquidity source, collateral for public funds, and as a stable source of income.\nThe following table shows the amortized cost of the Company's investment securities.

The Company provides a range of deposit services to businesses and individuals, including noninterest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, Individual Retirement Accounts (\"IRAs\") and certificates of deposit (\"CDs\"). These accounts generally earn interest at rates the Company establishes based on market factors and the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs. The establishment or continuity of a core deposit relationship can be a factor in loan pricing decisions. While the Company's primary focus is on establishing customer relationships to attract core deposits, at times, the Company uses brokered deposits and other wholesale deposits to supplement its funding sources. As of December 31, 2018, brokered deposits represented approximately 12.6 percent of total deposits.\nThe composition of the deposit portfolio, by category, as of December 31, 2018 was as follows: 33.8 percent in time deposits, 33.4 percent in money market and savings, 16.2 percent in interest-bearing demand deposit, and 16.6 percent in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. The composition of the deposit portfolio, by category, as of December 31, 2017 was as follows: 30.8 percent in time deposits, 37.8 percent in money market and savings, 16.1 percent in interest-bearing demand deposit, and 15.3 percent in noninterest-bearing demand deposits.\nThe following table summarizes the average balances outstanding and average interest rates for each major category of deposits for 2018 and 2017.\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest-bearing demand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>285,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>172,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing demand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>242,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Money market and savings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>601,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>342,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.51\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>536,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>329,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.98\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total average deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,667,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,011,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2018 the overall mix of average deposits has shifted to a higher percentage of noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing demand accounts, and time deposits with a reduction in the percentage of deposits held in money market and savings deposits. The Company believes its deposit product offerings are properly structured to attract and retain core low-cost deposit relationships. The average cost of deposits was 0.86 percent in 2018 compared to 0.54 percent in 2017 as deposit costs increased with rising interest rates.\nTotal deposits as of December 31, 2018 were $1,922.0 million, which was an increase of $483.4 million from December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had outstanding time deposits under $100,000 of $309.3 million, time deposits over $100,000 of $605.3 million, and a time deposit fair value adjustment of $759 thousand. The following table summarizes the maturities of time deposits $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2018.\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining maturity:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months or less\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three to six months\n</td> <td>99,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Six to twelve months\n</td> <td>217,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>More than twelve months\n</td> <td>190,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>605,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBorrowings\nThe Company uses short-term borrowings and long-term debt to provide both funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital for debt at the Company level which can be downstreamed as Tier 1 capital to the Bank. Short-term borrowings totaled $11.2 million December 31, 2018, and consisted primarily of federal funds purchased. Short-term borrowings totaled $33.6 million at December 31, 2017, and consisted entirely of federal funds purchased. Short-term borrowings totaled $18.5 million at December 31, 2016, and consisted of $5.0 million in FHLB advances maturing within twelve months and $13.5 million federal funds purchased. Long-term debt totaled $39.2 million at December 31, 2018 and consisted of subordinated debt. Long-term debt totaled $10 million at December 31, 2017 and consisted of one line of credit that matures in 2022. There was no long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2016.\nCapital Resources\nThe Company uses leverage analysis to examine the potential of the institution to increase assets and liabilities using the current capital base. The key measurements included in this analysis are the Banks' Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, leverage and total capital ratios. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our capital ratios, including our Banks' capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements. From time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank subsidiary. We believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our Bank, if necessary. Additional information on capital is provided in Note 14-Regulatory Matters to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $333.9 million of pre-approved but unused lines of credit and $12.2 million of standby letters of credit. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon. The total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If needed to fund these outstanding commitments, the Bank has the ability to liquidate Federal funds sold or securities available-for-sale, or on a short-term basis to borrow and purchase Federal funds from other financial institutions. Additional information about our off-balance sheet risk exposure is presented in Note 13-Commitments and Contingencies to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nMarket Risk and Liquidity Risk Management\nThe Bank's Asset Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d) is responsible for making decisions regarding liquidity and funding solutions based upon approved liquidity, loan, capital and investment policies. The ALCO must consider interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management when rendering a decision on funding solutions and loan pricing. To assist in this process the Bank has contracted with an independent third party to prepare quarterly reports that summarize several key asset-liability measurements. In addition, the third party will also provide recommendations to the Bank's ALCO regarding future balance sheet structure, earnings and liquidity strategies. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nInterest rate sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates. ALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. The primary measurements we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity are an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity model. These measurements are used in conjunction with competitive pricing analysis and are further described below.\nEarnings Simulation Model We believe interest rate risk is effectively measured by our earnings simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with simulated forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and 24 months. To limit interest rate risk, we have guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in instantaneous changes to interest rates. We also periodically monitor simulations based on various rate scenarios such as non-parallel shifts in market interest rates over time. For changes up or down in rates from our flat interest rate forecast over the next 12 and 24 months, limits in the decline in net interest income are as follows:\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maximum Percentage Decline in Net Interest\nIncome from the Budgeted or Base Case\nProjection of Net Interest Income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Next 12\nMonths\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Next 24\nMonths\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>An instantaneous, parallel rate increase or decrease of the following at the\nbeginning of the first quarter:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u00b1 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u00b1 200 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u00b1 300 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u00b1 400 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe were in compliance with our earnings simulation model policies as of December 31, 2018, indicating what we believe to be a slightly asset sensitive profile.\nEconomic Value of Equity Our economic value of equity model measures the extent that estimated economic values of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items will change as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case economic value of equity.\nTo help monitor our related risk, we've established the following policy limits regarding simulated changes in our economic value of equity:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Instantaneous, Parallel Change in Prevailing\nInterest Rates Equal to\n</td> <td>Maximum Percentage Decline in Economic Value of Equity from\nthe Economic Value of Equity at Currently Prevailing Interest Rates\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u00b1100 basis points\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u00b1200 basis points\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u00b1300 basis points\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u00b1400 basis points\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2018, our model results indicated that we were within these policy limits.\nEach of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates.\nIn addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. Our ALCO reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nThe purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand, deposit withdrawals, and our other needs. Traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits. A bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations. Funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective. The liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions.\nChanges in interest rates also affect our liquidity position. We currently price deposits in response to market rates and intend to continue this policy. If deposits are not priced in response to market rates, a loss of deposits could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position.\nScheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly, being influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions and competition. Additionally, debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity. We attempt to price our deposit products to meet our asset/liability objectives consistent with local market conditions. Our ALCO is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs. Our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nAs a financial institution, we have an asset and liability make-up that is distinctly different from that of an entity with substantial investments in plant and inventory, because the major portions of a commercial bank's assets are monetary in nature. As a result, our performance may be significantly influenced by changes in interest rates. Although we, and the banking industry, are more affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation in the prices of goods and services, inflation is a factor that may influence interest rates. However, the frequency and magnitude of interest rate fluctuations do not necessarily coincide with changes in the general inflation rate. Inflation does affect operating expenses in that personnel expenses and the cost of supplies and outside services tend to increase more during periods of high inflation.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company has identified accounting policies that are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate its reported financial results and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Management has reviewed the following critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. These policies along with a brief discussion of the material implications of the uncertainties of each policy are below. For a full description of these critical accounting policies, see Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nAllowance for loan losses - In establishing the allowance we take into account reserves required for impaired loans, historical charge-offs for loan types, and a variety of qualitative factors including economic outlook, portfolio concentrations, and changes in portfolio credit quality. Many of the qualitative factors are measurable but there is also a level of subjective assumptions. If those assumptions change it could have a material impact on the level of the allowance required and as a result the earnings of the Company. As an example an increase in the amount of the reserve to organic loans of 0.05 percent in 2018 would have resulted in a reduction of approximately 3 percent in pre-tax income.\nFair values for acquired assets and assumed liabilities- Assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the net estimated fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities is allocated to identifiable intangible assets with the remaining excess allocated to goodwill. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset's fair value. As of December 31, 2018 there was approximately $66.1 million in goodwill. The Company has not identified any triggering events that would indicate potential impairment of goodwill.\nCash flow estimates on purchased credit-impaired loans- Purchase credit impaired loans do not have traditional loan yields and interest income; instead they have accretable yield and accretion. Any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable discount and is recognized in interest income as accretion over the remaining life of the loan when there is reasonable expectation about the amount and timing of such cash flows. The amount expected to be accreted divided by the accretable discount is the accretable yield. Cash flow estimates are re-evaluated quarterly. If the estimated cash flows increase then the accretable yield over the life of the loan increases. If, however, the estimated cash flows decrease then impairment is generally recognized immediately. As an example a loan with a fair value of $200,000 with estimated cash flows of $300,000 over five years would have an accretable yield of approximately 8.2 percent and would have accretion of approximately $16,400 a year. If the cash flow estimate changed to $350,000 the accretable yield would increase to approximately 10.1 percent and the yearly accretion recognized into income would be approximately $20,300. If, however, the cash flow estimate changed to $250,000 the Company would generally recognize an impairment of $50,000 immediately, instead of reducing the accretion over the life of the loan.\nValuation of foreclosed assets - Foreclosed assets are initially recorded at fair value less selling costs. If the fair value decreases the assets are written down. As of December 31, 2018, there was approximately $2.5 million in foreclosed assets carried at a 23.3 percent discount to appraisal values.\nValuation of deferred tax assets- Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination. The determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date and is subject to management's judgment. Deferred tax assets may be reduced by deferred tax liabilities and a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of evidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2018, there were approximately $5.6 million in net deferred tax assets.\nEvaluation of investment securities for other than temporary impairment- We evaluate investment securities for other than temporary impairment taking into account if we do not have the intent to sell a debt security prior to recovery and it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery, the security would not be considered other than temporarily impaired unless a credit loss has occurred in the security. Temporary impairments are recognized on the balance sheet in other comprehensive income / loss. If a security becomes permanently impaired the impairment expense would be recognized and reduce earnings. As of December 31, 2018, there was approximately $3.0 million in gross unrealized losses on investment securities that were classified as temporarily impaired.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is a discussion of our financial condition at December 31, 2018 and 2017 and our results of operations for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included\nBusiness Overview\nThe Company's business model consists of leveraging capital into assets funded by liabilities. As a general rule capital can be leveraged approximately ten times. The primary source of revenue is interest income from earning assets, namely loans and securities. These liabilities used to fund the assets are primarily deposits. The Company seeks to maximize net interest income, the difference between interest received on earning assets and the amount of interest paid on liabilities. Net interest income to average assets is a key ratio that measures the profitability of the earning assets of the company. Noninterest income is the second source of revenue and primarily consists of customer service fees, gains on the sales of securities and loans, and other noninterest income. Noninterest income to average assets is a ratio that reflects our effectiveness in generating these other forms of revenue. The Company incurs noninterest expenses as result of the operations of its business. Primary expenses are those of employees, occupancy and equipment, professional services, and data processing. The Company seeks to minimize the amount of noninterest expense relative to the amount of total assets; noninterest expense to assets is a key ratio that measures the efficiency of the costs incurred to operate the business.\nExecutive Summary\nThe following is a summary of the Company's financial highlights and significant events during 2018:\n \u2022 Completed two acquisitions during the year which increased assets by approximately $444 million : Tennessee Bancshares the second quarter and Foothills Bancorp in the fourth quarter. \n \u2022 Earnings available to common shareholders increased to $18.1 million and earnings per share increased to $1.46. \n \u2022 Ended 2018 with record high total assets of $2.3 billion, net loans of $1.8 billion, and deposits of $1.9 billion. \n \u2022 Net interest margin, taxable equivalent, increased to 4.43 percent 2018 compared to 4.29 percent in 2017. \n \u2022 Efficiency ratio, which is equal to noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income, decreased to 70.7 percent in 2018, compared to 76.0 percent in 2017. \nAnalysis of Results of Operations\n2018 compared to 2017\nNet income was $18.1 million in 2018, compared to $5.0 million in 2017. Net income available to common shareholders was $18.1 million, or $1.45 per diluted common share, in 2018, compared to $4.8 million, or $0.55 per diluted common share, in 2017. Net interest income to average assets of 3.90 percent in 2018 held steady from in 2017. Noninterest income to average assets of 0.34 percent decreased from 0.42 percent in 2017 as growth in assets exceeded increases in noninterest income. Noninterest expense to average assets decreased from 3.29 percent in 2017 to 3.00 percent in 2018 as the company continued to capture economies of scale following the mergers. The resulting pretax income to average assets was 1.19 percent in 2018 compared to 1.00 percent in 2017. Finally, in 2018 the effective tax rate was 15.2 percent, which was lower than normal due to a tax benefit from options exercised while the rate of 56.2 percent in 2017 was elevated due to a $2.4 million after-tax charge to write down the Company's deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n2017 compared to 2016\nNet income was $5.0 million in 2017 a decrease from $5.8 million in 2016 primarily due to a $2.4 million after-tax charge to write down the Company's deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Net income available to common shareholders was $4.8 million, or $0.55 per diluted common share, in 2017 compared to $4.8 million, or $0.78 per diluted common share, in 2016. Net interest income to average assets of 3.90 percent in 2017 increased from 3.77 percent in 2016 as a result of a higher percentage of average earning assets to average total assets. Noninterest income to average assets of 0.42 percent in 2017 increased slightly from 0.41 percent in 2016 due to higher customer service fees, higher interchange and debit cards fees, and higher other noninterest income. Noninterest expense to average assets increased from 3.20 percent in 2016 to 3.29 percent in 2017 primarily due to $2.4 million in merger expenses. The resulting pretax income to average assets was 1.00 percent in 2017 compared to 0.95 percent in 2016. Finally, the effective tax rate of 56.2 percent in 2017 was elevated due to a $2.4 million after-tax charge to write down the Company's deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 while in 2016 the effective tax rate was 36.70 percent..\nNet Interest Income and Yield Analysis\n2018 compared to 2017\nNet interest income, taxable equivalent, increased to $76.8 million in 2018 from $46.4 million in 2017. The increase in net interest income, taxable equivalent, was the result of a significant increase in earning assets primarily from the mergers but also from organic business activity. Average earning assets increased from $1.1 billion in 2017 to $1.7 billion in 2018. Over this period, average loan balances increased by $592.1 million and average securities balances increased by $33.0 million. In addition, total average interest-bearing deposits increased by $543.1 million. Net interest income to average assets of 3.90 percent in 2018 was unchanged from 3.90 percent in 2017. Net interest margin, taxable equivalent, was 4.43 percent in 2018, compared to 4.29 percent in 2017, with the increase due to higher yields on earning assets. Net interest margin, taxable equivalent, was slightly negatively impacted by an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities from 0.66 percent in 2017 to 1.10 percent in 2018. In 2019 we expect net interest income to average assets and net interest margin, taxable equivalent, to experience pressure as there is the potential for pressure to increase deposit rates as short term rates have continued to increase but do anticipate the effect of rate increases will be mitigated on the income side by increases in yields of our floating rate earning assets.\n2017 compared to 2016\nNet interest income, taxable equivalent, increased to $46.4 million in 2017 from $38.3 million in 2016. The increase in net interest income, taxable equivalent, was the result of a significant increase in earning assets primarily from the merger but also from organic business activity. Average earning assets increased from $944.6 million in 2016 to $1.1 billion in 2017 . Over this period, average loan balances increased by $149.6 million and average securities and interest bearing balances decreased by $17.3 million. In addition, total average interest-bearing deposits increased by $113.8 million. Net interest income to average assets of 3.90 percent in 2017 increased from 3.77 percent in 2016 . Net interest margin, taxable equivalent, was 4.29 percent in 2017 4.06 percent in 2016, with the increase due to higher yields on earning assets.. Net interest margin, taxable equivalent, was slightly negatively impacted by an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities from 0.56 percent in 2016 to 0.66 percent in 2017.\nThe following table summarizes the major components of net interest income and the related yields and costs for the periods presented.\n\n (1) Loans include nonaccrual loans. Yields related to loans exempt from income taxes are stated on a taxable-equivalent basis assuming a federal income tax rate of 21.0 percent in 2018 and 34.0 percent in 2017 and 2016. The taxable-equivalent adjustment was $10 thousand for 2018, $28 thousand for 2017 and $16 thousand for 2016. Loan fees included in loan income was $2.7 million, $2.5 million, and $2.6 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n (2) Yields related to investment securities exempt from income taxes are stated on a taxable-equivalent basis assuming a federal income tax rate of 21.0 percent in 2018 and 34.0 percent in 2017 and 2016. The taxable-equivalent adjustment was $180 thousand, $90 thousand and $55 thousand for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n (3) Net interest spread represents the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. \n (4) Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. \nRate and Volume Analysis\nNet interest income, taxable equivalent, increased by $30.4 million between the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and by $8.1 million between the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The following is an analysis of the changes in net interest income comparing the changes attributable to rates and those attributable to volumes (in thousands):\n\n (1) Loans include nonaccrual loans.

Loan fees included in loan income was $2.7 million, $2.5 million, and $2.6 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n (2) Yields related to investment securities exempt from income taxes are stated on a taxable-equivalent basis assuming a federal income tax rate of of 21.0 percent in 2018 and 34.0 percent in 2017 and 2016. The taxable-equivalent adjustment was $180 thousand, $90 thousand and $55 thousand for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \nChanges in net interest income are attributed to either changes in average balances (volume change) or changes in average rates (rate change) for earning assets and sources of funds on which interest is received or paid.. Volume change is calculated as change in volume times the previous rate while rate change is change in rate times the previous volume. The change attributed to rates and volumes (change in rate times change in volume) is considered above as a change in volume.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table provides a summary of noninterest income for the periods presented.\n\n2018 compared to 2017\nNoninterest income totaled $6.6 million in 2018, which was an increase from $5.0 million in 2017. Noninterest income to average assets of 0.34 percent decreased from 0.42 percent in 2017. Primary drivers of the decrease were a change in the accounting treatment form interchange and debit card transaction fees, which starting in 2018 are shown net of direct costs. In 2018, there were gains of $1.4 million on the sale of mortgage loans, SBA loans and other assets compared to $1.3 million in 2017. Other noninterest income of $2.2 million in 2018 increased from $1.3 million in 2017 primarily due to higher income from bank owned life insurance and higher income from investment operations. In 2018, we expect noninterest income to average assets to increase as a result of increased loan sales from the mortgage unit, higher service charges on deposit accounts, increases in income from investment services, and greater other noninterest income.\n2017 compared to 2016\nNoninterest income totaled $5.0 million in 2017, which was an increase from $4.2 million in 2016. Noninterest income to average assets of 0.42 percent in 2017 increased slightly from 0.41 percent in 2016. Primary drivers of the increase were higher gains higher customer service fees, higher interchange and debit cards fees, and higher other noninterest income. In 2017, there were $1.4 million in customer service fees compared to $1.1 million in 2016 due to higher volumes. Interchange an debit card fees increased from$732 thousand in 2016 to $952 thousand in 2017 due to higher volumes. Other noninterest income of $1.3 million in 2017 increased from $986 thousand in 2016 primarily due to increased revenue as a result of the merger.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table provides a summary of noninterest expense for the periods presented.\n\n2018 compared to 2017\nNoninterest expense totaled $59.0 million in 2018 compared to $39.1 million in 2017. Noninterest expense to average assets decreased from 3.29 percent in 2017 to 3.00 percent in 2018. Salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, and other noninterest expense categories in 2018 were all higher as a result of post-merger expenses including ten additional months of Capstone expenses, seven additional months of Tennessee Bancshares expenses, and two additional months of Foothills expenses. In 2019, we expect noninterest expense to average assets to increase as anticipated increases in merger expenses offset reductions in core operating expenses.\n2017 compared to 2016\nNoninterest expense totaled $39.1 million in 2017 compared to $32.5 million in 2016 . Noninterest expense to average assets increased from 3.20 percent in 2016 to 3.29 percent in 2017. Salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, and other noninterest expense categories in 2017 were all higher as a result of two full months of post-merger expense. In 2017 noninterest expense was also elevated by $2.4 million of merger expenses, compared to none in 2016.\nIncome Taxes\n2018 compared to 2017\nIn 2018, income tax expense totaled $3.2 million compared to $6.4 million in 2017. In 2018 the effective tax rate was 15.2 percent, which was lower than normal due to a tax benefit from options exercised in the prior period while the rated of 56.2 percent in 2017 was elevated due to a $2.4 million after-tax charge to write down the Company's deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In 2019, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 25 percent.\n2017 compared to 2016\nIn 2017, income tax expense totaled $6.4 million compared to $3.4 million in 2016. The effective tax rate of 56.2 percent in 2017 was elevated due to a $2.4 million after-tax charge to reduce the value of the Company's deferred tax assets as a result of the tax law signed in December compared to 36.7 percent in 2016\nLoan Portfolio Composition\nThe Company had total net loans outstanding, including organic and purchased loans, of approximately $1.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2017. Loans secured by real estate, consisting of commercial or residential property, are the principal component of our loan portfolio. We do not generally originate traditional long-term residential mortgages for our portfolio but we do originate and hold traditional second mortgage residential real estate loans, adjustable rate mortgages and home equity lines of credit. Even if the principal purpose of the loan is not to finance real estate, when reasonable, we attempt to obtain a security interest in the real estate in addition to any other available collateral to increase the likelihood of ultimate repayment or collection of the loan.\nOrganic Loans\nOur net organic loans increased $356.6 million, or 44.9 percent to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2018, from December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the mergers. Our goal of streamlining the credit process has improved our efficiency and is a competitive advantage in many of our markets. In addition, continued training and recruiting of experienced loan officers has provided us with the opportunity to close larger and more complex deals than we historically have. Finally, the overall business environment continues to rebound from recessionary conditions. Organic loans include loans which were originally purchased non-credit impaired loans but have been renewed.\nPurchased Loans\nPurchased non-credit impaired loans of $584.5 million at December 31, 2018 increased by $93.6 million from December 31, 2017 as a result of the mergers. Also during 2018, our purchased credit impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans increased by $1.4 million to $34.2 million at December 31, 2018. The activity within the purchased credit impaired loans will be impacted by how quickly these loans are resolved and/or our future acquisition activity.\nThe following tables summarize the composition of our loan portfolio for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n\n\n\n\n\nLoan Portfolio Maturities\nThe following table sets forth the maturity distribution of our loans, including the interest rate sensitivity for loans maturing after one year (dollars in thousands).\n\nNonaccrual, Past Due, and Restructured Loans\nLoans are considered past due when the contractual amounts due with respect to principal and interest are not received within 30 days of the contractual due date. Loans are generally classified as nonaccrual if they are past due for a period of 90 days or more, unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection. If a loan or a portion of a loan is classified as doubtful or as partially charged off, the loan is generally classified as nonaccrual. Loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than 90 days may also be classified as nonaccrual if repayment in full of principal and interest is in doubt. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time, and there is a sustained period of repayment performance of interest and principal by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms.\nPCI loans with common risk characteristics are grouped in pools at acquisition. These loans are evaluated for accrual status at the pool level rather than the individual loan level and performance is based on our ability to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows rather than a borrower's ability to repay contractual loan amounts. Since we are able to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows on the Company's PCI loan pools, none of these loans have been identified as nonaccrual. However, PCI loans included in pools are identified as nonperforming if they are past due 90 days or more at acquisition or become 90 days or more past due after acquisition. The past due status is determined based on the contractual terms of the individual loans.\nWhile a loan is classified as nonaccrual and the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is doubtful, collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to the principal outstanding, except in the case of loans with scheduled amortizations where the payment is generally applied to the oldest payment due. When the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is expected, interest income may be recognized on a cash basis. In the case where a nonaccrual loan had been partially charged off, recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate. Receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge-offs have been fully recovered.\nAssets acquired as a result of foreclosure are recorded at estimated fair value in foreclosed assets. Any excess of cost over estimated fair value at the time of foreclosure is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Valuations are periodically performed on these properties, and any subsequent write-downs are charged to earnings. Routine maintenance and other holding costs are included in noninterest expense.\nLoans, excluding pooled PCI loans, are classified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDR\u201d) by the Company when certain modifications are made to the loan terms and concessions are granted to the borrowers due to financial difficulty experienced by those borrowers. The Company grants concessions by (1) reduction of the stated interest rate for the remaining original life of the debt or (2) extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk. The Company does not generally grant concessions through forgiveness of principal or accrued interest. The Company's policy with respect to accrual of interest on loans restructured in a TDR follows relevant supervisory guidance. That is, if a borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous loan terms and shows capacity to perform under the restructured loan terms, continued accrual of interest at the restructured interest rate is likely. If a borrower was materially delinquent on payments prior to the restructuring but shows the capacity to meet the restructured loan terms, the loan will likely continue as nonaccrual until there is demonstrated performance under new terms. Lastly, if the borrower does not perform under the restructured terms, the loan is placed on non-accrual status. The Company closely monitors these loans and ceases accruing interest on them if we believe that the borrowers may not continue performing based on the restructured note terms.\nPCI loans that were classified as TDRs prior to acquisition are not classified as TDRs by the Company after the acquisition date. Subsequent modification of a PCI loan accounted for in a pool that would otherwise meet the definition of a TDR is not reported, or accounted for, as a TDR since pooled PCI loans are excluded from the scope of TDR accounting. A PCI loan not accounted for in a pool would be reported, and accounted for, as a TDR if modified in a manner that meets the definition of a TDR after the acquisition date.\nNonperforming loans as a percentage of gross loans, net of deferred fees, was 0.18 percent as of December 31, 2018, compared to 0.25 percent as of December 31, 2017. Total nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets as of December 31, 2018 totaled 0.25 percent compared to 0.34 percent as of December 31, 2017. Acquired PCI loans that are included in loan pools are reclassified at acquisition to accrual status and thus are not included as nonperforming assets unless they are 90 days or greater past due. In 2018, there was $124 thousand in interest income recognized on nonaccrual and restructured loans compared to the $222 thousand in gross interest income that would have been recognized if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's nonperforming assets as of December 31 for the periods presented.\n\n (1) Balances include PCI loans past due 90 days or more that are grouped in pools which accrue interest based on pool yields. \nPotential Problem Loans\nAt December 31, 2018 problem loans amounted to approximately $784.0 thousand or 0.04 percent of total loans outstanding. Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming loans, represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by the Bank's primary regulators, for loans classified as substandard or worse, but not considered nonperforming loans.\nAllocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nWe maintain the allowance at a level that we deem appropriate to adequately cover the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our allowance for loan losses was $8.3 million and $5.9 million, respectively, which we deemed to be adequate at each of the respective dates. The increase in the allowance for loan losses in 2018 as compared to 2017 is primarily the result of increases in organic loan growth offset slightly by improving overall credit metrics within our portfolio. Our allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans has increased from 0.44 percent at December 31, 2017 to 0.47 percent at December 31, 2018. As a percentage of organic loans the allowance for loan losses decreased slightly from 0.73 percent at December 31, 2017 to 0.71 percent at December 31, 2018. In 2019, we expect the allowance to organic loans to remain in the range of 0.70 to 0.80 percent.\nOur purchased loans were recorded at fair value upon acquisition. The fair value adjustments on the performing purchased loans will be accreted into income over the life of the loans. At December 31, 2018, the remaining accretable yield was approximately $7.1 million. Also at the end of 2018, the balance on PCI loans was $48.4 million and the carrying value was $34.2 million, for a net difference of $14.2 million in discounts. These loans are subject to the same allowance methodology as our legacy portfolio. The calculated allowance is compared to the remaining fair value discount to determine if additional provisioning should be recognized. At December 31, 2018, there was no allowance on PCI loans. The judgments and estimates associated with our allowance determination are described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nThe following table sets forth, based on our best estimate, the allocation of the allowance to types of loans as well as the unallocated portion as of December 31 for each of the past five years and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans (in thousands):\n\nThe increase in the overall allowance for loan losses is due to the increased balance of organic loans offset by improvements of our loan portfolio and the reduction of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs, which is largely influenced by the overall improvement in the economies in our market areas. The allocation by category is determined based on the assigned risk rating, if applicable, and environmental factors applicable to each category of loans. For impaired loans, those loans are reviewed for a specific allowance allocation. Specific valuation allowances related to impaired loans were approximately $534 thousand at December 31, 2018, compared to $445 thousand at December 31, 2017. Additional information on the allocation of the allowance between performing and impaired loans is provided in Note 4-Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe following is a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses for each of the years in the five-year period ended December 31, 2018 and the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans as of the end of each period (in thousands):\n\nWe assess the adequacy of the allowance at the end of each calendar quarter. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolios, past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, the views of the Bank's regulators, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay (including the timing of future payments), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change.\nInvestment Portfolio\nOur investment portfolio which is carried at fair market value, consisting primarily of Federal agency bonds, mortgage-backed securities, state and municipal securities and other debt securities amounted to $201.7 million and $151.9 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This increase was a result of purchasing additional investments from liquidity received through the sale of the investment portfolios after the two mergers. In 2016, the investment portfolio amounted to $131.0 million million and it increased in 2017 to $151.9 million as a result purchasing additional investments from liquidity received through the sale of the investment portfolios after the Capstone merger. Our investment to asset ratio has decreased from 12.1 percent at December 31, 2016, to 8.8 percent at December 31, 2017, and then increased slightly to 8.9 percent at December 31, 2018. Over the last several years we have reduced the ratio of investments to total assets and the absolute level of investment securities on our balance sheet as we have allocated more funding to loans. Our investment portfolio serves many purposes including serving as a potential liquidity source, collateral for public funds, and as a stable source of income.\nThe following table shows the amortized cost of the Company's investment securities. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, all investment securities were classified as available for sale.\nInvestment Securities\n(in thousands)\n\nThe following table presents the contractual maturity of investment securities by contractual maturity date and average yields based on amortized cost (for all obligations on a fully taxable basis). The composition and maturity / repricing distribution of the securities portfolio is subject to change depending on rate sensitivity, capital and liquidity needs.\nExpected Maturity of Investment Securities\nAs of December 31, 2018\n(in thousands)\n\n(1) Based on amortized cost, taxable equivalent basis\nDeposits\nDeposits are the primary source of funds for the Company's lending and investing activities. The Company provides a range of deposit services to businesses and individuals, including noninterest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, Individual Retirement Accounts (\"IRAs\") and certificates of deposit (\"CDs\"). These accounts generally earn interest at rates the Company establishes based on market factors and the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs. The establishment or continuity of a core deposit relationship can be a factor in loan pricing decisions. While the Company's primary focus is on establishing customer relationships to attract core deposits, at times, the Company uses brokered deposits and other wholesale deposits to supplement its funding sources. As of December 31, 2018, brokered deposits represented approximately 12.6 percent of total deposits.\nThe composition of the deposit portfolio, by category, as of December 31, 2018 was as follows: 33.8 percent in time deposits, 33.4 percent in money market and savings, 16.2 percent in interest-bearing demand deposit, and 16.6 percent in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. The composition of the deposit portfolio, by category, as of December 31, 2017 was as follows: 30.8 percent in time deposits, 37.8 percent in money market and savings, 16.1 percent in interest-bearing demand deposit, and 15.3 percent in noninterest-bearing demand deposits.\nThe following table summarizes the average balances outstanding and average interest rates for each major category of deposits for 2018 and 2017.\n\nDuring 2018 the overall mix of average deposits has shifted to a higher percentage of noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing demand accounts, and time deposits with a reduction in the percentage of deposits held in money market and savings deposits. The Company believes its deposit product offerings are properly structured to attract and retain core low-cost deposit relationships. The average cost of deposits was 0.86 percent in 2018 compared to 0.54 percent in 2017 as deposit costs increased with rising interest rates.\nTotal deposits as of December 31, 2018 were $1,922.0 million, which was an increase of $483.4 million from December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had outstanding time deposits under $100,000 of $309.3 million, time deposits over $100,000 of $605.3 million, and a time deposit fair value adjustment of $759 thousand. The following table summarizes the maturities of time deposits $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2018.\n\nBorrowings\nThe Company uses short-term borrowings and long-term debt to provide both funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital for debt at the Company level which can be downstreamed as Tier 1 capital to the Bank. Short-term borrowings totaled $11.2 million December 31, 2018, and consisted primarily of federal funds purchased. Short-term borrowings totaled $33.6 million at December 31, 2017, and consisted entirely of federal funds purchased. Short-term borrowings totaled $18.5 million at December 31, 2016, and consisted of $5.0 million in FHLB advances maturing within twelve months and $13.5 million federal funds purchased. Long-term debt totaled $39.2 million at December 31, 2018 and consisted of subordinated debt. Long-term debt totaled $10 million at December 31, 2017 and consisted of one line of credit that matures in 2022. There was no long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2016.\nCapital Resources\nThe Company uses leverage analysis to examine the potential of the institution to increase assets and liabilities using the current capital base. The key measurements included in this analysis are the Banks' Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, leverage and total capital ratios. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our capital ratios, including our Banks' capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements. From time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank subsidiary. We believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our Bank, if necessary. Additional information on capital is provided in Note 14-Regulatory Matters to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $333.9 million of pre-approved but unused lines of credit and $12.2 million of standby letters of credit. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon. The total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If needed to fund these outstanding commitments, the Bank has the ability to liquidate Federal funds sold or securities available-for-sale, or on a short-term basis to borrow and purchase Federal funds from other financial institutions. Additional information about our off-balance sheet risk exposure is presented in Note 13-Commitments and Contingencies to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nMarket Risk and Liquidity Risk Management\nThe Bank's Asset Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d) is responsible for making decisions regarding liquidity and funding solutions based upon approved liquidity, loan, capital and investment policies. The ALCO must consider interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management when rendering a decision on funding solutions and loan pricing. To assist in this process the Bank has contracted with an independent third party to prepare quarterly reports that summarize several key asset-liability measurements. In addition, the third party will also provide recommendations to the Bank's ALCO regarding future balance sheet structure, earnings and liquidity strategies. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nInterest rate sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates. ALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. The primary measurements we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity are an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity model. These measurements are used in conjunction with competitive pricing analysis and are further described below.\nEarnings Simulation Model We believe interest rate risk is effectively measured by our earnings simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with simulated forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and 24 months. To limit interest rate risk, we have guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in instantaneous changes to interest rates. We also periodically monitor simulations based on various rate scenarios such as non-parallel shifts in market interest rates over time. For changes up or down in rates from our flat interest rate forecast over the next 12 and 24 months, limits in the decline in net interest income are as follows:\n\nWe were in compliance with our earnings simulation model policies as of December 31, 2018, indicating what we believe to be a slightly asset sensitive profile.\nEconomic Value of Equity Our economic value of equity model measures the extent that estimated economic values of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items will change as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case economic value of equity.\nTo help monitor our related risk, we've established the following policy limits regarding simulated changes in our economic value of equity:\n\nAt December 31, 2018, our model results indicated that we were within these policy limits.\nEach of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates.\nIn addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. Our ALCO reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nThe purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand, deposit withdrawals, and our other needs. Traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits. A bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations. Funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective. The liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions.\nChanges in interest rates also affect our liquidity position. We currently price deposits in response to market rates and intend to continue this policy. If deposits are not priced in response to market rates, a loss of deposits could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position.\nScheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly, being influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions and competition. Additionally, debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity. We attempt to price our deposit products to meet our asset/liability objectives consistent with local market conditions. Our ALCO is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs. Our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nAs a financial institution, we have an asset and liability make-up that is distinctly different from that of an entity with substantial investments in plant and inventory, because the major portions of a commercial bank's assets are monetary in nature. As a result, our performance may be significantly influenced by changes in interest rates. Although we, and the banking industry, are more affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation in the prices of goods and services, inflation is a factor that may influence interest rates. However, the frequency and magnitude of interest rate fluctuations do not necessarily coincide with changes in the general inflation rate. Inflation does affect operating expenses in that personnel expenses and the cost of supplies and outside services tend to increase more during periods of high inflation.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company has identified accounting policies that are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate its reported financial results and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Management has reviewed the following critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. These policies along with a brief discussion of the material implications of the uncertainties of each policy are below. For a full description of these critical accounting policies, see Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nAllowance for loan losses - In establishing the allowance we take into account reserves required for impaired loans, historical charge-offs for loan types, and a variety of qualitative factors including economic outlook, portfolio concentrations, and changes in portfolio credit quality. Many of the qualitative factors are measurable but there is also a level of subjective assumptions. If those assumptions change it could have a material impact on the level of the allowance required and as a result the earnings of the Company. As an example an increase in the amount of the reserve to organic loans of 0.05 percent in 2018 would have resulted in a reduction of approximately 3 percent in pre-tax income.\nFair values for acquired assets and assumed liabilities- Assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the net estimated fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities is allocated to identifiable intangible assets with the remaining excess allocated to goodwill. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset's fair value. As of December 31, 2018 there was approximately $66.1 million in goodwill. The Company has not identified any triggering events that would indicate potential impairment of goodwill.\nCash flow estimates on purchased credit-impaired loans- Purchase credit impaired loans do not have traditional loan yields and interest income; instead they have accretable yield and accretion. Any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable discount and is recognized in interest income as accretion over the remaining life of the loan when there is reasonable expectation about the amount and timing of such cash flows. The amount expected to be accreted divided by the accretable discount is the accretable yield. Cash flow estimates are re-evaluated quarterly. If the estimated cash flows increase then the accretable yield over the life of the loan increases. If, however, the estimated cash flows decrease then impairment is generally recognized immediately. As an example a loan with a fair value of $200,000 with estimated cash flows of $300,000 over five years would have an accretable yield of approximately 8.2 percent and would have accretion of approximately $16,400 a year. If the cash flow estimate changed to $350,000 the accretable yield would increase to approximately 10.1 percent and the yearly accretion recognized into income would be approximately $20,300. If, however, the cash flow estimate changed to $250,000 the Company would generally recognize an impairment of $50,000 immediately, instead of reducing the accretion over the life of the loan.\nValuation of foreclosed assets - Foreclosed assets are initially recorded at fair value less selling costs. If the fair value decreases the assets are written down. As of December 31, 2018, there was approximately $2.5 million in foreclosed assets carried at a 23.3 percent discount to appraisal values.\nValuation of deferred tax assets- Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination. The determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date and is subject to management's judgment. Deferred tax assets may be reduced by deferred tax liabilities and a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of evidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2018, there were approximately $5.6 million in net deferred tax assets.\nEvaluation of investment securities for other than temporary impairment- We evaluate investment securities for other than temporary impairment taking into account if we do not have the intent to sell a debt security prior to recovery and it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery, the security would not be considered other than temporarily impaired unless a credit loss has occurred in the security. Temporary impairments are recognized on the balance sheet in other comprehensive income / loss. If a security becomes permanently impaired the impairment expense would be recognized and reduce earnings. As of December 31, 2018, there was approximately $3.0 million in gross unrealized losses on investment securities that were classified as temporarily impaired.", "item_7_tables": "Table 117:

summary of the key points from the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- The company's business model is leveraging capital into interest-earning assets funded by liabilities to generate net interest income. Noninterest income and careful expense management also contribute to profits.\n\n2018 Financial Highlights\n- Completed two acquisitions which increased assets by $444 million. \n- Earnings increased to $18.1 million and earnings per share rose to $1.46.\n- Ended 2018 with record total assets ($2.3B), loans ($1.8B), and deposits ($1.9B).\n- Net interest margin increased from 4.29% in 2017 to 4.43% in 2018. \n- Efficiency ratio improved from 76.0% in 2017 to 70.7% in 2018.\n\nAnalysis of Financial Results\n- Net income rose due to acquisitions, organic growth, higher yields on earning assets, and controlled expenses.\n- Loan growth was strong in 2018 while credit quality improved.  \n- Deposits increased, especially noninterest-bearing, but costs rose with higher rates.\n- Capital levels remained above regulatory requirements.\n\nRisk Management\n- Interest rate risk and liquidity risk are monitored closely. Rate sensitivity appears balanced and liquidity is adequate. \n- Credit risk is diversified and allowance levels are appropriate.\n- Critical accounting policies around allowance, fair value estimates, impairments etc. involve judgement but appear reasonable.\n\nIn summary, financial performance improved in 2018 through acquisitions, loan growth, margin expansion, and controlled expenses. Risk levels appear appropriate."}
