MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCaution Regarding Forward-looking Statements\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements regarding matters that could have an impact on our business, financial condition, and future operations. These statements, based on our expectations and estimates, are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors. These risks, uncertainties, and other factors include, but are not limited to, general business conditions, demand for energy, federal and state legislative and regulatory actions and legal and administrative proceedings, changes in and compliance with environmental laws and regulations, general credit and capital market conditions, weather conditions, the cost of commodities used in our industry, and unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures. Our actual results may vary materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of these and other factors. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which the statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.\nOverview\nWe are a not-for-profit power supply cooperative owned entirely by our eleven Class A member distribution cooperatives and a Class B member, TEC. We supply our member distribution cooperatives' energy and demand requirements through a portfolio of resources including generating facilities, long-term and short-term physically-delivered forward power purchase contracts, and spot market energy purchases. We also supply the transmission services necessary to deliver this power to our member distribution cooperatives.\nOur results for the year ended December 31, 2018, were primarily impacted by the commercial operation of Wildcat Point, and weather that resulted in increases in our member distribution cooperatives' requirements for power and the dispatch of our generating facilities. Additionally, in 2018 we increased our total energy rate and completed the sale of our Rock Springs combustion turbine facility and related assets.\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Wildcat Point, which achieved commercial operation and was available for dispatch by PJM on April 17, 2018, generated 23.0% of our total available energy in 2018, resulting in increased fuel expense.

The average total cost of energy sold to our member distribution cooperatives increased 14.1% due to the total energy rate increases implemented in 2018. Energy sales in MWh to our member distribution cooperatives increased 4.0%.

See Factors Affecting Results-Generating Facilities-Sale of Rock Springs Combustion Turbine Facility.\u201d\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements reflect the consolidated accounts of ODEC and TEC. See Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that our management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements. We base these estimates and assumptions on information available as of the date of the financial statements. We consider the following accounting policies to be critical accounting policies due to the estimation involved in each.\nAccounting for Regulated Operations\nWe are a rate-regulated entity and, as a result, are subject to the accounting requirements of Accounting for Regulated Operations. In accordance with Accounting for Regulated Operations, certain of our revenues and expenses can be deferred at the discretion of our board of directors, which has budgetary and rate setting authority, if it is probable that these amounts will be collected or returned through our formula rate in future periods. Regulatory assets represent costs that we expect to collect from our member distribution cooperatives based on rates approved by our board of directors in accordance with our formula rate. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in our revenues associated with amounts that we expect to return to our member distribution cooperatives based on rates approved by our board of directors in accordance with our formula rate. See Factors Affecting Results-Formula Rate\u201d below. Regulatory assets are generally included in deferred charges and regulatory liabilities are generally included in deferred credits and other liabilities. Deferred energy, which can be either a regulatory asset or regulatory liability, is included in current assets or current liabilities, respectively. We recognize regulatory assets and liabilities as expenses or as a reduction in expenses, respectively, concurrent with their recovery through rates.\nDeferred Energy\nIn accordance with Accounting for Regulated Operations, we use the deferral method of accounting to recognize differences between our energy expenses and our energy revenues collected from our member distribution cooperatives. Deferred energy on our Consolidated Statements of Revenues, Expenses, and Patronage Capital represents the difference between energy revenues, which are based upon energy rates approved by our board, and energy expenses, which are based upon actual energy costs incurred. The deferred energy balance on our Consolidated Balance Sheet represents the net accumulation of any under- or over-collection of energy costs. Under-collected energy costs appear as an asset and will be collected from our member distribution cooperatives in subsequent periods through our formula rate. Conversely, over-collected energy costs appear as a liability and will be returned to our member distribution cooperatives in subsequent periods through our formula rate.\nMargin Stabilization\nMargin Stabilization allows us to review our actual demand-related costs of service and demand revenues and adjust revenues from our member distribution cooperatives to meet our financial coverage requirements and accumulate additional equity as approved by our board of directors. Our formula rate allows us to collect and return amounts utilizing Margin Stabilization. We record all adjustments, whether increases or decreases, in the year affected and allocate any adjustments to our member distribution cooperatives based on power sales during that year. We collect these increases from our member distribution cooperatives, or offset decreases against amounts owed by our member distribution cooperatives to us, generally in the succeeding calendar year. We adjust operating revenues and accounts receivable-members or accounts payable-members, as appropriate, to reflect these adjustments. These adjustments are treated as due, owed, incurred, and accrued for the year to which the adjustment relates. See Factors Affecting Results-Formula\nRate\u201d below. The following table details the reduction in revenues utilizing Margin Stabilization for the past three years:\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Margin Stabilization adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $15,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $34,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $15,123\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounting for Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations\nAccounting for Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at fair value when incurred and capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset. In the absence of quoted market prices, we estimate the fair value of our asset retirement obligations using present value techniques, in which estimates of future cash flows associated with retirement activities are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Asset retirement obligations currently reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet were measured during a period of historically low interest rates. The impact on measurements of new asset retirement obligations using different rates in the future may be significant.\nA significant portion of our asset retirement obligations relates to our share of the future costs to decommission North Anna. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our share of North Anna's nuclear decommissioning asset retirement obligation totaled $110.2 million, or 84.5% of total asset retirement obligations, and $105.8 million, or 83.7% of our total asset retirement obligations, respectively. Approximately every four years, a new decommissioning study for North Anna is performed by third-party experts. The third-party experts provide us with periodic site-specific base year\u201d cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost, and timing of planned decommissioning activities for North Anna. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of future cash flows for extended periods are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. In addition, these estimates are dependent on subjective factors, including the selection of cost escalation rates, which we consider to be a critical assumption. Our current estimate is based on a study that was performed in 2014 and adopted effective December 1, 2014. We are not aware of any events that have occurred since the 2014 study that would materially impact our estimate. We anticipate that the next study will be performed in 2019. See \"Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8.\nWe determine cost escalation rates, which represent projected cost increases over time, due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities. The following table details the weighted average cost escalation rates used by the study:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> Year Study\nPerformed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Weighted\nAverage Cost\nEscalation Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.27\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe weighted average cost escalation rate was applied if the cash flows increased as compared to the previous study. The original weighted average cost escalation rate was applied if the cash flows decreased as compared to the previous study. The use of alternative rates would have been material to the liabilities recognized. For example, had we increased the cost escalation rates by 0.5%, the amount recognized as of December 31, 2018, for our asset retirement obligations related to nuclear decommissioning would have been $21.4 million higher.\nAccounting for Derivatives and Hedging\nWe primarily purchase power under both long-term and short-term physically-delivered forward contracts to supply power to our member distribution cooperatives. These forward purchase contracts meet the accounting definition of a\nderivative; however, a majority of these forward purchase derivative contracts qualify for the normal purchases/normal sales accounting exception under Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging. As a result, these contracts are not recorded at fair value. We record a liability and purchased power expense when the power under the physically-delivered forward contract is delivered. We also purchase natural gas futures generally for three years or less to hedge the price of natural gas for our facilities which utilize natural gas. These derivatives do not qualify for the normal purchases/normal sales accounting exception.\nFor all derivative contracts that do not qualify for the normal purchases/normal sales accounting exception, we defer all unrealized gains and losses on a net basis as a regulatory liability or regulatory asset, respectively, in accordance with Accounting for Regulated Operations. These amounts are subsequently reclassified as purchased power or fuel expense on our Consolidated Statements of Revenues, Expenses, and Patronage Capital as the power or fuel is delivered and/or the contract settles.\nGenerally, derivatives are reported at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheet in the regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities account, and deferred charges-other or deferred credits and other liabilities-other. The measurement of fair value is based on actively quoted market prices, if available. Otherwise, we seek indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications.\nFactors Affecting Results\nMargins\nWe operate on a not-for-profit basis and, accordingly, seek to generate revenues sufficient to recover our cost of service and produce margins sufficient to establish reasonable reserves, meet financial coverage requirements, and accumulate additional equity approved by our board of directors. Revenues in excess of expenses in any year are designated as net margin attributable to ODEC on our Consolidated Statements of Revenues, Expenses, and Patronage Capital. We designate retained net margins attributable to ODEC on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as patronage capital, which we assign to each of our members on the basis of its class of membership and business with us.\nFormula Rate\nOur power sales are comprised of two power products - energy and demand. Energy is the physical electricity delivered through transmission and distribution facilities to customers. We must have sufficient committed energy available to us for delivery to our member distribution cooperatives to meet their maximum energy needs at any time, with limited exceptions. This committed available energy at any time is referred to as demand.\nThe rates we charge our member distribution cooperatives for sales of energy and demand are determined by a formula rate accepted by FERC. On December 2, 2013, FERC accepted our formula rate effective January 1, 2014, subject to refund, and established hearing and settlement procedures. On January 19, 2017, FERC directed us to submit a compliance filing making certain revisions to the formula rate. These revisions to the formula rate did not change our overall revenue requirements. On March 22, 2018, FERC accepted our compliance filing and required us to file a refund report to calculate the difference between rates charged under our rate schedule since January 1, 2014, and rates that would have been charged under the revised rate schedule submitted in our compliance filing. On July 24, 2018, FERC accepted the refund report, which resulted in a reallocation of costs among our member distribution cooperatives and did not result in any change to our operating revenues.\nOur formula rate is intended to permit collection of revenues which will equal the sum of:\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> all of our costs and expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 20% of our total interest charges (margin requirement); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> additional equity contributions approved by our board of directors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe formula rate identifies the cost components that we can collect through rates, but not the actual amounts to be collected. With limited minor exceptions, we can change our rates periodically to match the costs we have incurred and we expect to incur without seeking FERC approval.\nEnergy costs, which are primarily variable costs, such as natural gas, nuclear, and coal fuel costs, and the energy costs under our power purchase contracts with third parties, are recovered through two separate rates, the base energy rate and the energy adjustment rate (collectively referred to as the total energy rate). The base energy rate is developed annually to collect energy costs as estimated in our budget including amounts in the deferred energy account from the prior year. As of January 1 of each year, the base energy rate is reset in accordance with our budget and the energy adjustment rate is reset to zero. We can revise the energy adjustment rate during the year if it becomes apparent that the total energy rate is over-collecting or under-collecting our actual and anticipated energy costs. Any revision to the energy adjustment rate requires board approval and that the resulting change to the total energy rate is at least 2%.\nDemand costs, which are primarily fixed costs, such as depreciation expense, interest expense, administrative and general expenses, capacity costs under power purchase contracts with third parties, transmission costs, margin requirement, and additional equity contributions approved by our board of directors, are recovered through our demand rates. The formula rate allows us to change the actual demand rates we charge as our demand-related costs change, without FERC approval, with the exception of decommissioning cost, which is a fixed number in the formula rate that requires FERC approval prior to any adjustment. FERC approval is also needed to change account classifications currently in the formula or to add accounts not otherwise included in the current formula. Additionally, depreciation studies are required to be filed with FERC for its approval if they would result in a change in our depreciation rates. We collect our total demand costs through the following three separate rates:\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> transmission service rate - designed to collect transmission-related and distribution-related costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> RTO capacity service rate - designed to collect capacity costs in PJM that PJM allocates to ODEC and all other PJM members; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> remaining owned capacity service rate - designed to collect all remaining demand costs not billed and/or recovered under the transmission service and RTO capacity service rates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs stated above, our margin requirement, and additional equity contributions approved by our board of directors are recovered through our demand rates. We establish our demand rates to produce a net margin attributable to ODEC equal to 20% of our budgeted total interest charges, plus additional equity contributions approved by our board of directors. The formula rate permits us to adjust revenues from the member distribution cooperatives to equal our actual total demand costs incurred, including a net margin attributable to ODEC equal to 20% of actual interest charges, plus additional equity contributions approved by our board. We make these adjustments utilizing Margin Stabilization. See Critical Accounting Policies-Margin Stabilization\u201d above.\nWe may revise our budget at any time to the extent that our current budget does not accurately reflect our costs and expenses or estimates of our sales of power. Increases or decreases in our budget automatically amend the energy and/or the demand components of our formula rate, as necessary. If at any time our board of directors determines that the formula does not meet all of our costs and expenses, it may adopt a new formula to meet those costs and expenses, subject to any necessary regulatory review and approval.\nRecognition of Revenue\nOur operating revenues reflect the actual demand-related costs we incurred plus the energy costs that we collected. Estimated demand-related costs are collected during the period through the demand components of our formula rate. In accordance with Margin Stabilization, these costs, as well as operating revenues, are adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect actual demand-related costs incurred during that period. See Critical Accounting Policies-Margin Stabilization\u201d above. Estimated energy costs are collected during the period through the energy components of our formula rate. Operating revenues are not adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect actual energy costs incurred during that period. The difference between actual energy costs incurred and energy costs collected during each period is recorded as deferred energy expense, which may be a positive or negative number. See Critical Accounting Policies-Deferred Energy\u201d above.\nWe bill energy to each of our member and non-member customers based on the total MWh delivered to them each month. We bill demand costs through three separate rates: a transmission service rate, an RTO capacity service rate, and a remaining owned capacity service rate. See -Formula Rate\u201d above. The transmission service rate is billed to\neach of our member distribution cooperatives based on its contribution to the single zonal coincident peak (the hour of the month the need for energy is highest) for the prior year within each of the PJM transmission zones. The RTO capacity service rate is billed to each of our member distribution cooperatives based on its contribution to the average of the five hourly PJM coincident peaks in the prior year, subject to add-backs for participation in PJM demand response programs. The remaining owned capacity service rate is billed to each of our member distribution cooperatives based on its contribution to the monthly zonal coincident peak.\nMember Distribution Cooperatives' Requirements for Power\nChanges in the number of customers and those customers' requirements for power significantly affect our member distribution cooperatives' requirements for power. Factors affecting our member distribution cooperatives' requirements for power include:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Weather - Weather affects the demand for electricity. Relatively higher or lower temperatures tend to increase the demand for energy to use air conditioning and heating systems, respectively. Mild weather generally reduces the demand for energy because heating and air conditioning systems are operated less. Weather also plays a role in the price of energy through its effects on the market price for fuel, particularly natural gas.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Heating and cooling degree days are measurement tools used to quantify the need to utilize heating or cooling, respectively, for a building.

In a single calendar day, it is possible to have multiple heating degree and cooling degree days.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe heating and cooling degree days for the past three years were as follows:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Heating degree days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,217\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cooling degree days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,519\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Economy - General economic conditions have an impact on the rate of growth of our member distribution cooperatives' energy requirements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Residential growth - Residential growth in our member distribution cooperatives' service territories and increases in consumption levels increase the requirements for power.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Commercial growth - The amount, size, and usage of electronics and machinery and the expansion of operations among our member distribution cooperatives' commercial and industrial customers impact the requirements for power.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Behind-the-meter (distributed generation) resources - Growth in the number of consumers who serve all or a portion of their electricity requirements from resources behind-the-meter, such as solar panels or local micro-grids, reduces the requirements for power.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor additional discussion of our member distribution cooperatives' customers, see Members-Member Distribution Cooperatives-Service Territories and Customers\u201d in Item 1.\nPower Supply Resources\nIn an attempt to provide stable power costs to our member distribution cooperatives, we utilize a combination of our owned generating resources and purchases from the market. We also regularly evaluate options for future power sources, including additional owned generation and power purchase contracts.\nMarket forces influence the structure and price of new power supply contracts into which we enter. When we enter into long-term power purchase contracts or agree to purchase energy at a date in the future, we rely on models based on our judgment and assumptions of factors such as future demand for power and market prices of energy and the price of commodities, such as natural gas, used to generate electricity. Our actual results may vary from what our models predict,\nwhich may in turn impact our resulting costs to our members. Additionally, our models become less reliable the further into the future that the estimates are made. See Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A.\nIn 2018, our generating facilities satisfied approximately 88.3% of our PJM capacity obligation and 57.1% of our energy requirements. We obtained the remainder of our PJM capacity obligation through the PJM RPM capacity auction process and purchased capacity contracts. The energy requirements not met by our owned generating facilities were obtained from multiple suppliers under various long-term and short-term physically-delivered forward power purchase contracts and spot market purchases. See Business-Power Supply Resources\u201d in Item 1 and Properties\u201d in Item 2.\nPJM\nPJM is an RTO that serves all of Delaware and Maryland, and most of Virginia, as well as other areas outside our member distribution cooperatives' service territories. We are a member of PJM and are therefore subject to the operations of PJM. PJM coordinates and establishes policies for the generation, purchase, and sale of capacity and energy in the control areas of its members, including all of the service territories of our member distribution cooperatives. As a result, our generating facilities are under dispatch control of PJM.\nPJM balances its participants' power requirements with the power resources available to supply those requirements. Based on this evaluation of supply and demand, PJM schedules and dispatches available generating facilities throughout its region in a manner intended to meet the demand for energy in the most reliable and cost-effective manner. Thus, PJM directs the dispatch of these facilities even though it does not own them. When PJM cannot dispatch the most economical generating facilities due to transmission constraints, PJM will dispatch more expensive generating facilities to meet power requirements. For these reasons, actions by PJM may materially affect our operating results. PJM compensates us for the capacity of our generating facilities made available without regard to whether our generating facilities are dispatched. See Business-Power Supply Resources-PJM\u201d in Item 1.\nWe transmit power to our member distribution cooperatives through the transmission facilities subject to PJM operational control. We have agreements with PJM which provide us with access to transmission facilities under PJM's control as necessary to deliver energy to our member distribution cooperatives. We own a limited amount of transmission facilities. See Properties-Transmission\u201d in Item 2.\nTransmission owners within PJM have made significant investments in their transmission systems. Because transmission rates are established to recover the cost of investment plus a return on the investment, PJM's rates for network transmission services have increased significantly in recent years. Our transmission costs are impacted each year by billing determinants, which are based on our usage during the peak hour of the year for each transmission area. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Operating Expenses\u201d in Item 7.\nLimited Exception under Wholesale Power Contracts\nWe have a wholesale power contract with each of our member distribution cooperatives. Each contract obligates us to sell and deliver to the member distribution cooperative, and obligates the member distribution cooperative to purchase and receive from us, all power that it requires for the operation of its system, with limited exceptions. One of the limited exceptions permits each of our member distribution cooperatives, with 180 days prior written notice, to receive up to the greater of 5% of its demand and associated energy or 5 MW and associated energy from its owned generation or from other suppliers. If all of our member distribution cooperatives elected to utilize the 5% or 5 MW exception, we estimate the current impact would be a reduction of approximately 176 MW of demand and associated energy. As of May 1, 2018, there was an aggregate of approximately 67 MW remaining that could be utilized under this exception.

While only one unit is refueled at a time, this refueling schedule typically results in both units being off-line for refueling during the same calendar year once every three years. During 2018 and 2017, one unit at North Anna was off-line for refueling. During 2016, both units at North Anna were off-line for refueling.\nSale of Rock Springs Combustion Turbine Facility\nOn September 14, 2018, we sold our interest in Rock Springs and related assets to EPRS for $115 million. Prior to the sale, we and EPRS had each individually owned two natural gas-fired combustion turbine units and a 50% undivided interest in related common facilities at Rock Springs. The transaction resulted in a gain of $42.7 million, which our board of directors approved to defer as a regulatory liability. We amortized $5.0 million of the gain in 2018 and the remaining $37.7 million will be amortized ratably in 2019.\nChanging Environmental Regulation\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation regarding environmental matters. This regulation is becoming increasingly stringent through amendments to federal and state statutes and the development of regulations authorized by existing law. Future federal and state legislation and regulations present the potential for even greater obligations to limit the impact on the environment from the operation of our generating and transmission facilities. See Business-Regulation- Environmental\u201d in Item 1 and Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A.\nSales to Member Distribution Cooperatives\nRevenues from sales to our member distribution cooperatives are a function of our formula rate for sales of power and sales of renewable energy credits to our member distribution cooperatives, and our member distribution cooperatives' customers' requirements for power. See \"-Member Distribution Cooperatives' Requirements for Power\" above. Our formula rate is based on our cost of service in meeting these requirements. See -Formula Rate\u201d above.\nSales to Non-members\nRevenues from sales to non-members consist of sales of excess purchased and generated energy and sales of renewable energy credits. We primarily sell excess energy to PJM under its rates for providing energy imbalance service. Excess energy is the result of changes in our purchased power portfolio, differences between actual and forecasted needs, and changes in market conditions.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Revenues\nOur operating revenues are derived from sales of power and renewable energy credits to our member distribution cooperatives and non-members.

18.3%, as compared to 2017. Energy revenues increased $76.6 million, or 18.6%, due to the increase in the average total cost of energy sold to our member distribution cooperatives and an increase in energy sales in MWh to our member distribution cooperatives. The average cost of energy sold to our member distribution cooperatives increased 14.1% due to the 11.1% and 3.7% total energy rate increases we implemented January 1, 2018 and April 1, 2018, respectively. See table below. Energy sales in MWh to our member distribution cooperatives increased 4.0%. Absent the impact of the removal of load under the limited exception under wholesale power contracts beginning May 1, 2018, our energy sales in MWh would have increased by 6.1%. See Factors Affecting Results-Limited Exception Under Wholesale Power Contracts\u201d. Demand revenues increased $57.2 million, or 17.9%, primarily due to the increase in transmission expense and recognition of Wildcat Point expenses related to operations and maintenance, administrative and general, depreciation, and interest charges.\nIn 2017, total revenues from sales to our member distribution cooperatives decreased $115.5 million, or 13.6%, as compared to 2016 primarily due to the decrease in energy revenues. Energy revenues decreased $85.7 million, or 17.2%, due to the 13.3% decrease in the average total cost of energy sold to our member distribution cooperatives and the 4.5% decrease in energy sales in MWh to our member distribution cooperatives. The average cost of energy sold to our member distribution cooperatives was impacted by the rate decreases we implemented in 2016 and 2017 (see table below). The decrease in the volume of energy sales was primarily a result of the reduction in our load requirements related to a limited exception provision in our wholesale power contract and retail choice in Virginia. See Factors Affecting Results-Limited Exception Under Wholesale Power Contracts\u201d. These two events represented a 437,430 MWh load reduction in 2017, as compared to 2016. Additionally, we experienced milder weather in 2017. Demand revenues decreased $29.8 million, or 8.5%, primarily due to decreases in transmission expense and capacity-related purchased power expense, and the recovery of North Anna Unit 3 development costs; partially offset by the deferral of revenue and the increase in the additional equity contribution.\nThe following table summarizes the changes to our total energy rate since 2016, which were implemented to address the differences in our realized as well as projected energy costs:\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> Effective Date of Rate Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> April 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 1, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> April 1, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 1, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-members\nIn 2018, revenues from sales to non-members increased $45.6 million, as compared to the same period in 2017. Revenues from sales of excess energy increased $47.9 million primarily due to the increase in the volume of excess energy sales. We primarily sell excess energy to PJM at the prevailing market price at the time of sale. Excess energy is the result of changes in our purchased power portfolio, differences between actual and forecasted needs, and changes in market conditions.\nIn 2017, revenues from sales to non-members decreased $9.2 million, as compared to the same period in 2016, due to the $5.3 million decrease in revenue from sales of excess energy primarily due to a decrease in the volume of excess energy sales, and the $4.0 million decrease in revenue from sales of renewable energy credits.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following is a summary of the components of our operating expenses for the past three years.\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 187,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 94,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 138,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchased power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 397,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 397,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 408,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transmission\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 135,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 121,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,400\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (43,698\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operations and maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Administrative and general\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of regulatory asset/(liability), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,853\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accretion of asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Taxes, other than income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Operating Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 869,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 713,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 832,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating expenses are comprised of the costs that we incur to generate and purchase power to meet the needs of our member distribution cooperatives, and the costs associated with any sales of power to non-members.

Investment income increased $7.5 million in 2017, as compared to 2016, primarily due to increased earnings on our nuclear decommissioning trust.\nInterest Income on North Anna Unit 3 Cost Recovery\nInterest income on North Anna Unit 3 cost recovery represents interest received from Virginia Power related to the recovery of a portion of our North Anna Unit 3 regulatory asset. In 2015, we recovered 70% of these costs from Virginia Power and, with our board of directors' approval, amortized the remaining balance in 2015. On June 1, 2017, Virginia Power agreed to return the remaining balance of North Anna Unit 3 development costs that we incurred as part of the resolution of other regulatory matters with Virginia Power. The remaining balance of North Anna Unit 3 development costs, including interest through May 2018, totals $11.6 million. In the second quarter of 2017, we recorded $6.9 million as amortization of regulatory asset/liability, net, and $4.4 million as interest income on North Anna Unit 3 cost recovery on our Consolidated Statements of Revenues, Expenses, and Patronage Capital. During the second quarter of 2017, we received a payment of $6.8 million and established a receivable for the remaining balance, which continued to accrue interest until the remaining balance was paid in 2018. See \"Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8.\nInterest Charges, Net\nThe primary factors affecting our interest charges, net are issuance of indebtedness, scheduled payments of principal on our indebtedness, interest charges related to our revolving credit facility, and capitalized interest.

In 2017, interest charges, net decreased $2.1 million, or 7.2%, as compared to 2016, due to the $5.3 million increase in allowance for borrowed funds used during construction primarily related to Wildcat Point, partially offset by the $3.2 million increase in total interest charges.\nNet Margin Attributable to ODEC\nIn 2018, net margin attributable to ODEC, which is a function of our total interest charges plus any additional equity contributions approved by our board of directors, decreased $13.3 million, primarily as a result of the absence of equity contributions in 2018, as compared to 2017. In 2017, net margin attributable to ODEC, increased $9.0 million, primarily as a result of the $14.1 million equity contribution in 2017, as compared to the $5.8 million equity contribution in 2016. See Factors Affecting Results-Formula Rate\u201d above.\nFinancial Condition\nThe principal changes in our financial condition from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, were caused by increases in property, plant, and equipment, regulatory liability-deferred gain on sale of asset, deferred energy, accounts payable, and decreases in construction work in progress, lease deposits, obligations under long-term lease, revolving credit facility, and regulatory liability-deferred revenue.\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Property, plant, and equipment increased $700.3 million, primarily due to the reclassification of Wildcat Point from construction work in progress, partially offset by the decrease related to the sale of our interest in Rock Springs and related assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Regulatory liability-deferred gain on sale of asset increased $37.7 million due to the remaining balance of the deferral of the gain on the sale of our interest in Rock Springs and related assets, which will be amortized ratably in 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Deferred energy increased $22.4 million as a result of the under-collection of our energy costs in 2018.

Additionally, in 2018, we had cash provided by the sale of Rock Springs and related assets.\nOperations\nIn 2018, 2017, and 2016, our operating activities provided cash flows of $58.2 million, $56.5 million, and $88.5 million, respectively.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe maintain a revolving credit facility to cover our short-term and medium-term funding needs that are not met by cash from operations or other available funds. Commitments under this syndicated credit agreement extend until March 1, 2024. Available funding under this facility totals $500 million through March 3, 2022, and $400 million from March 4, 2022 through March 1, 2024. We did not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2018; however, the interest rate on borrowings would have been 3.5%. As of December 31, 2018, we had a $2.5 million letter of credit outstanding under this facility. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding under this facility, $43.4 million in borrowings at a weighted average interest rate of 2.6% and $12.0 million in letters of credit.\nThe syndicated credit agreement contains customary events of default, which, if they occur, would terminate our ability to borrow amounts under this facility and potentially accelerate any outstanding loans under this facility at the election of the lenders.

These capital expenditures consist primarily of the costs related to the development, construction, acquisition, or improvement of our owned generating facilities.\nUses\nOur uses of liquidity and capital relate to funding our working capital needs, investment activities, and financing activities. Substantially all of our investment activities relate to capital expenditures in connection with our generating facilities. We expect that cash flow from our operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and financings in the debt capital markets will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated future operational and capital requirements.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe regularly forecast our capital expenditures as part of our long-term business planning activities. We review these projections periodically in order to update our calculations to reflect changes in our future plans, construction costs, market factors, and other items affecting our forecasts.

Long-term debt includes both the principal of and interest on long-term debt, and long-term debt due within one year.\nPower Purchase Obligations\nAs part of our power supply strategy, we entered into a number of agreements for the purchase of energy or capacity, or both, in order to meet our member distribution cooperatives' requirements. See Business-Power Supply Resources-Power Purchase Contracts\u201d in Item 1.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe account for our asset retirement obligations in accordance with Accounting for Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at fair value when incurred and capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset. A significant portion of our asset retirement obligations relates to our share of the future costs to decommission North Anna. See Critical Accounting Policies-Accounting for Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations\u201d above.\nOperating Lease Obligations\nOur obligation described above with respect to operating lease obligations relates to our lease for our headquarters building.\nConstruction Obligations\nOur construction obligations include payments related to Wildcat Point EPC contractor payments and major equipment purchase contracts.\nSignificant Contingent Obligations\nIn addition to these existing contractual obligations, we have significant contingent obligations. These obligations primarily relate to power purchase arrangements and our arrangement with TEC. Some of our power purchase contracts obligate us to provide credit support if our obligations issued under the Indenture are rated below specified thresholds by S&P and Moody's.\nPower Purchase Arrangements\nUnder the terms of most of our hedging instruments, we typically agree to provide collateral under certain circumstances and we require comparable terms from our counterparties. The collateral we may be required to post with a counterparty, and vice versa, is normally a function of the collateral thresholds we negotiate with a counterparty relative to a range of credit ratings as well as the value of our transaction(s) under a contract with a respective counterparty. As of December 31, 2018, the collateral we had posted with counterparties pursuant to the hedging instruments we have in place totaled $6.7 million. Typically, collateral thresholds under our contracts are zero once an entity is rated below investment grade by S&P or Moody's (i.e., BBB-\u201d or Baa3,\u201d respectively). As of December 31, 2018, if our credit ratings had been below investment grade we estimate we would have been obligated to post between $250 million and $300 million of collateral with our counterparties. This calculation is based on energy prices on December 31, 2018, and delivered power for which we have not yet paid. Depending on the difference between the price of power under our contracts and the price of power in the market at the time of the calculation, this amount could increase or decrease.\nAdditionally, in accordance with its credit policy, PJM subjects each applicant, participant and member of PJM to a credit evaluation to determine its creditworthiness, and whether it must provide any collateral to support its obligations in connection with its PJM transactions. A material change in our financial condition, including the downgrading of our credit rating by any rating agency, could cause PJM to re-evaluate our creditworthiness and require that we provide collateral. As of December 31, 2018, if PJM had determined that we needed to provide collateral to support our obligations, PJM could have asked us to provide up to approximately $11.4 million as collateral.\nTEC Guarantees\nTEC is considered a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary, and we have consolidated its results and eliminated all intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. To facilitate the ability of TEC to sell power in the market, we have agreed to guarantee up to a maximum of $200 million of TEC's delivery and payment obligations associated with its energy trades, if requested. See Business-Members-TEC\u201d in Item 1. Our agreement to guarantee these obligations continues in effect until we elect to terminate it by providing at least 30 days' prior written notice of termination or until all amounts owed to us by TEC have been paid. Our guarantee of TEC's obligations will enable it to maintain sufficient credit support to meet its delivery and payment obligations associated with its energy trades. As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any guarantees outstanding in support of TEC's obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCaution Regarding Forward-looking Statements\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements regarding matters that could have an impact on our business, financial condition, and future operations. These statements, based on our expectations and estimates, are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors. These risks, uncertainties, and other factors include, but are not limited to, general business conditions, demand for energy, federal and state legislative and regulatory actions and legal and administrative proceedings, changes in and compliance with environmental laws and regulations, general credit and capital market conditions, weather conditions, the cost of commodities used in our industry, and unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures. Our actual results may vary materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of these and other factors. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which the statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.\nOverview\nWe are a not-for-profit power supply cooperative owned entirely by our eleven Class A member distribution cooperatives and a Class B member, TEC. We supply our member distribution cooperatives' energy and demand requirements through a portfolio of resources including generating facilities, long-term and short-term physically-delivered forward power purchase contracts, and spot market energy purchases. We also supply the transmission services necessary to deliver this power to our member distribution cooperatives.\nOur results for the year ended December 31, 2018, were primarily impacted by the commercial operation of Wildcat Point, and weather that resulted in increases in our member distribution cooperatives' requirements for power and the dispatch of our generating facilities. Additionally, in 2018 we increased our total energy rate and completed the sale of our Rock Springs combustion turbine facility and related assets.\n \u2022 Wildcat Point, which achieved commercial operation and was available for dispatch by PJM on April 17, 2018, generated 23.0% of our total available energy in 2018, resulting in increased fuel expense. Once commercial operation was achieved, we began recognizing expenses related to operations and maintenance, administrative and general, depreciation, and interest charges. \n \u2022 Generation from our combustion turbine facilities increased 51.3% as compared to 2017, due to PJM's economic dispatch of these facilities, which resulted in increased fuel expense. \n \u2022 Due to the increased generation from our owned generating facilities, our non-member sales increased as compared to 2017. \n \u2022 Our revenues from sales to our member distribution cooperatives increased 18.3% as compared to 2017. Energy revenues increased 18.6% due to the increase in the average total cost of energy sold to our member distribution cooperatives and an increase in energy sales in MWh to our member distribution cooperatives. The average total cost of energy sold to our member distribution cooperatives increased 14.1% due to the total energy rate increases implemented in 2018. Energy sales in MWh to our member distribution cooperatives increased 4.0%. Demand revenues increased 17.9%, primarily due to the increase in transmission expense and recognition of Wildcat Point-related expenses. \n \u2022 As a result of higher costs, we under-collected energy costs by $52.3 million in the first quarter of 2018. As of March 31, 2018, our deferred energy balance was $55.9 million under-collected. To address the under-collection, we increased our total energy rate 3.7% effective April 1, 2018. As of December 3, 2018, our deferred energy balance was $26.1 million under-collected. \n \u2022 On September 14, 2018, we sold our interest in Rock Springs and related assets for $115 million. We utilized a portion of the funds to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The sale of Rock \n Springs resulted in a gain of $42.7 million, which our board of directors approved to defer as a regulatory liability. We amortized $5.0 million of the gain in 2018 and will amortize the remaining balance in 2019. See Factors Affecting Results-Generating Facilities-Sale of Rock Springs Combustion Turbine Facility.\u201d \nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements reflect the consolidated accounts of ODEC and TEC. See Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that our management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements. We base these estimates and assumptions on information available as of the date of the financial statements. We consider the following accounting policies to be critical accounting policies due to the estimation involved in each.\nAccounting for Regulated Operations\nWe are a rate-regulated entity and, as a result, are subject to the accounting requirements of Accounting for Regulated Operations. In accordance with Accounting for Regulated Operations, certain of our revenues and expenses can be deferred at the discretion of our board of directors, which has budgetary and rate setting authority, if it is probable that these amounts will be collected or returned through our formula rate in future periods. Regulatory assets represent costs that we expect to collect from our member distribution cooperatives based on rates approved by our board of directors in accordance with our formula rate. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in our revenues associated with amounts that we expect to return to our member distribution cooperatives based on rates approved by our board of directors in accordance with our formula rate. See Factors Affecting Results-Formula Rate\u201d below. Regulatory assets are generally included in deferred charges and regulatory liabilities are generally included in deferred credits and other liabilities. Deferred energy, which can be either a regulatory asset or regulatory liability, is included in current assets or current liabilities, respectively. We recognize regulatory assets and liabilities as expenses or as a reduction in expenses, respectively, concurrent with their recovery through rates.\nDeferred Energy\nIn accordance with Accounting for Regulated Operations, we use the deferral method of accounting to recognize differences between our energy expenses and our energy revenues collected from our member distribution cooperatives. Deferred energy on our Consolidated Statements of Revenues, Expenses, and Patronage Capital represents the difference between energy revenues, which are based upon energy rates approved by our board, and energy expenses, which are based upon actual energy costs incurred. The deferred energy balance on our Consolidated Balance Sheet represents the net accumulation of any under- or over-collection of energy costs. Under-collected energy costs appear as an asset and will be collected from our member distribution cooperatives in subsequent periods through our formula rate. Conversely, over-collected energy costs appear as a liability and will be returned to our member distribution cooperatives in subsequent periods through our formula rate.\nMargin Stabilization\nMargin Stabilization allows us to review our actual demand-related costs of service and demand revenues and adjust revenues from our member distribution cooperatives to meet our financial coverage requirements and accumulate additional equity as approved by our board of directors. Our formula rate allows us to collect and return amounts utilizing Margin Stabilization. We record all adjustments, whether increases or decreases, in the year affected and allocate any adjustments to our member distribution cooperatives based on power sales during that year. We collect these increases from our member distribution cooperatives, or offset decreases against amounts owed by our member distribution cooperatives to us, generally in the succeeding calendar year. We adjust operating revenues and accounts receivable-members or accounts payable-members, as appropriate, to reflect these adjustments. These adjustments are treated as due, owed, incurred, and accrued for the year to which the adjustment relates. See Factors Affecting Results-Formula\nRate\u201d below. The following table details the reduction in revenues utilizing Margin Stabilization for the past three years:\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Margin Stabilization adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $15,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $34,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $15,123\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounting for Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations\nAccounting for Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at fair value when incurred and capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset. In the absence of quoted market prices, we estimate the fair value of our asset retirement obligations using present value techniques, in which estimates of future cash flows associated with retirement activities are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Asset retirement obligations currently reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet were measured during a period of historically low interest rates. The impact on measurements of new asset retirement obligations using different rates in the future may be significant.\nA significant portion of our asset retirement obligations relates to our share of the future costs to decommission North Anna. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our share of North Anna's nuclear decommissioning asset retirement obligation totaled $110.2 million, or 84.5% of total asset retirement obligations, and $105.8 million, or 83.7% of our total asset retirement obligations, respectively. Approximately every four years, a new decommissioning study for North Anna is performed by third-party experts. The third-party experts provide us with periodic site-specific base year\u201d cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost, and timing of planned decommissioning activities for North Anna. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of future cash flows for extended periods are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. In addition, these estimates are dependent on subjective factors, including the selection of cost escalation rates, which we consider to be a critical assumption. Our current estimate is based on a study that was performed in 2014 and adopted effective December 1, 2014. We are not aware of any events that have occurred since the 2014 study that would materially impact our estimate. We anticipate that the next study will be performed in 2019. See \"Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8.\nWe determine cost escalation rates, which represent projected cost increases over time, due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities. The following table details the weighted average cost escalation rates used by the study:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> Year Study\nPerformed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Weighted\nAverage Cost\nEscalation Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.27\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe weighted average cost escalation rate was applied if the cash flows increased as compared to the previous study. The original weighted average cost escalation rate was applied if the cash flows decreased as compared to the previous study. The use of alternative rates would have been material to the liabilities recognized. For example, had we increased the cost escalation rates by 0.5%, the amount recognized as of December 31, 2018, for our asset retirement obligations related to nuclear decommissioning would have been $21.4 million higher.\nAccounting for Derivatives and Hedging\nWe primarily purchase power under both long-term and short-term physically-delivered forward contracts to supply power to our member distribution cooperatives. These forward purchase contracts meet the accounting definition of a\nderivative; however, a majority of these forward purchase derivative contracts qualify for the normal purchases/normal sales accounting exception under Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging. As a result, these contracts are not recorded at fair value. We record a liability and purchased power expense when the power under the physically-delivered forward contract is delivered. We also purchase natural gas futures generally for three years or less to hedge the price of natural gas for our facilities which utilize natural gas. These derivatives do not qualify for the normal purchases/normal sales accounting exception.\nFor all derivative contracts that do not qualify for the normal purchases/normal sales accounting exception, we defer all unrealized gains and losses on a net basis as a regulatory liability or regulatory asset, respectively, in accordance with Accounting for Regulated Operations. These amounts are subsequently reclassified as purchased power or fuel expense on our Consolidated Statements of Revenues, Expenses, and Patronage Capital as the power or fuel is delivered and/or the contract settles.\nGenerally, derivatives are reported at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheet in the regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities account, and deferred charges-other or deferred credits and other liabilities-other. The measurement of fair value is based on actively quoted market prices, if available. Otherwise, we seek indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications.\nFactors Affecting Results\nMargins\nWe operate on a not-for-profit basis and, accordingly, seek to generate revenues sufficient to recover our cost of service and produce margins sufficient to establish reasonable reserves, meet financial coverage requirements, and accumulate additional equity approved by our board of directors. Revenues in excess of expenses in any year are designated as net margin attributable to ODEC on our Consolidated Statements of Revenues, Expenses, and Patronage Capital. We designate retained net margins attributable to ODEC on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as patronage capital, which we assign to each of our members on the basis of its class of membership and business with us.\nFormula Rate\nOur power sales are comprised of two power products - energy and demand. Energy is the physical electricity delivered through transmission and distribution facilities to customers. We must have sufficient committed energy available to us for delivery to our member distribution cooperatives to meet their maximum energy needs at any time, with limited exceptions. This committed available energy at any time is referred to as demand.\nThe rates we charge our member distribution cooperatives for sales of energy and demand are determined by a formula rate accepted by FERC. On December 2, 2013, FERC accepted our formula rate effective January 1, 2014, subject to refund, and established hearing and settlement procedures. On January 19, 2017, FERC directed us to submit a compliance filing making certain revisions to the formula rate. These revisions to the formula rate did not change our overall revenue requirements. On March 22, 2018, FERC accepted our compliance filing and required us to file a refund report to calculate the difference between rates charged under our rate schedule since January 1, 2014, and rates that would have been charged under the revised rate schedule submitted in our compliance filing. On July 24, 2018, FERC accepted the refund report, which resulted in a reallocation of costs among our member distribution cooperatives and did not result in any change to our operating revenues.\nOur formula rate is intended to permit collection of revenues which will equal the sum of:\n \u2022 all of our costs and expenses; \n \u2022 20% of our total interest charges (margin requirement); and \n \u2022 additional equity contributions approved by our board of directors. \nThe formula rate identifies the cost components that we can collect through rates, but not the actual amounts to be collected. With limited minor exceptions, we can change our rates periodically to match the costs we have incurred and we expect to incur without seeking FERC approval.\nEnergy costs, which are primarily variable costs, such as natural gas, nuclear, and coal fuel costs, and the energy costs under our power purchase contracts with third parties, are recovered through two separate rates, the base energy rate and the energy adjustment rate (collectively referred to as the total energy rate). The base energy rate is developed annually to collect energy costs as estimated in our budget including amounts in the deferred energy account from the prior year. As of January 1 of each year, the base energy rate is reset in accordance with our budget and the energy adjustment rate is reset to zero. We can revise the energy adjustment rate during the year if it becomes apparent that the total energy rate is over-collecting or under-collecting our actual and anticipated energy costs. Any revision to the energy adjustment rate requires board approval and that the resulting change to the total energy rate is at least 2%.\nDemand costs, which are primarily fixed costs, such as depreciation expense, interest expense, administrative and general expenses, capacity costs under power purchase contracts with third parties, transmission costs, margin requirement, and additional equity contributions approved by our board of directors, are recovered through our demand rates. The formula rate allows us to change the actual demand rates we charge as our demand-related costs change, without FERC approval, with the exception of decommissioning cost, which is a fixed number in the formula rate that requires FERC approval prior to any adjustment. FERC approval is also needed to change account classifications currently in the formula or to add accounts not otherwise included in the current formula. Additionally, depreciation studies are required to be filed with FERC for its approval if they would result in a change in our depreciation rates. We collect our total demand costs through the following three separate rates:\n \u2022 transmission service rate - designed to collect transmission-related and distribution-related costs; \n \u2022 RTO capacity service rate - designed to collect capacity costs in PJM that PJM allocates to ODEC and all other PJM members; and \n \u2022 remaining owned capacity service rate - designed to collect all remaining demand costs not billed and/or recovered under the transmission service and RTO capacity service rates. \nAs stated above, our margin requirement, and additional equity contributions approved by our board of directors are recovered through our demand rates. We establish our demand rates to produce a net margin attributable to ODEC equal to 20% of our budgeted total interest charges, plus additional equity contributions approved by our board of directors. The formula rate permits us to adjust revenues from the member distribution cooperatives to equal our actual total demand costs incurred, including a net margin attributable to ODEC equal to 20% of actual interest charges, plus additional equity contributions approved by our board. We make these adjustments utilizing Margin Stabilization. See Critical Accounting Policies-Margin Stabilization\u201d above.\nWe may revise our budget at any time to the extent that our current budget does not accurately reflect our costs and expenses or estimates of our sales of power. Increases or decreases in our budget automatically amend the energy and/or the demand components of our formula rate, as necessary. If at any time our board of directors determines that the formula does not meet all of our costs and expenses, it may adopt a new formula to meet those costs and expenses, subject to any necessary regulatory review and approval.\nRecognition of Revenue\nOur operating revenues reflect the actual demand-related costs we incurred plus the energy costs that we collected. Estimated demand-related costs are collected during the period through the demand components of our formula rate. In accordance with Margin Stabilization, these costs, as well as operating revenues, are adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect actual demand-related costs incurred during that period. See Critical Accounting Policies-Margin Stabilization\u201d above. Estimated energy costs are collected during the period through the energy components of our formula rate. Operating revenues are not adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect actual energy costs incurred during that period. The difference between actual energy costs incurred and energy costs collected during each period is recorded as deferred energy expense, which may be a positive or negative number. See Critical Accounting Policies-Deferred Energy\u201d above.\nWe bill energy to each of our member and non-member customers based on the total MWh delivered to them each month. We bill demand costs through three separate rates: a transmission service rate, an RTO capacity service rate, and a remaining owned capacity service rate. See -Formula Rate\u201d above. The transmission service rate is billed to\neach of our member distribution cooperatives based on its contribution to the single zonal coincident peak (the hour of the month the need for energy is highest) for the prior year within each of the PJM transmission zones. The RTO capacity service rate is billed to each of our member distribution cooperatives based on its contribution to the average of the five hourly PJM coincident peaks in the prior year, subject to add-backs for participation in PJM demand response programs. The remaining owned capacity service rate is billed to each of our member distribution cooperatives based on its contribution to the monthly zonal coincident peak.\nMember Distribution Cooperatives' Requirements for Power\nChanges in the number of customers and those customers' requirements for power significantly affect our member distribution cooperatives' requirements for power. Factors affecting our member distribution cooperatives' requirements for power include:\n \u2022 Weather - Weather affects the demand for electricity. Relatively higher or lower temperatures tend to increase the demand for energy to use air conditioning and heating systems, respectively. Mild weather generally reduces the demand for energy because heating and air conditioning systems are operated less. Weather also plays a role in the price of energy through its effects on the market price for fuel, particularly natural gas. \n \u2022 Heating and cooling degree days are measurement tools used to quantify the need to utilize heating or cooling, respectively, for a building. Heating degree days are calculated as the number of degrees below 60 degrees in a single day. Cooling degree days are calculated as the number of degrees above 65 degrees in a single day. In a single calendar day, it is possible to have multiple heating degree and cooling degree days. \nThe heating and cooling degree days for the past three years were as follows:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Heating degree days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,217\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cooling degree days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,519\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 Economy - General economic conditions have an impact on the rate of growth of our member distribution cooperatives' energy requirements. \n \u2022 Residential growth - Residential growth in our member distribution cooperatives' service territories and increases in consumption levels increase the requirements for power. \n \u2022 Commercial growth - The amount, size, and usage of electronics and machinery and the expansion of operations among our member distribution cooperatives' commercial and industrial customers impact the requirements for power. \n \u2022 Behind-the-meter (distributed generation) resources - Growth in the number of consumers who serve all or a portion of their electricity requirements from resources behind-the-meter, such as solar panels or local micro-grids, reduces the requirements for power. \nFor additional discussion of our member distribution cooperatives' customers, see Members-Member Distribution Cooperatives-Service Territories and Customers\u201d in Item 1.\nPower Supply Resources\nIn an attempt to provide stable power costs to our member distribution cooperatives, we utilize a combination of our owned generating resources and purchases from the market. We also regularly evaluate options for future power sources, including additional owned generation and power purchase contracts.\nMarket forces influence the structure and price of new power supply contracts into which we enter. When we enter into long-term power purchase contracts or agree to purchase energy at a date in the future, we rely on models based on our judgment and assumptions of factors such as future demand for power and market prices of energy and the price of commodities, such as natural gas, used to generate electricity. Our actual results may vary from what our models predict,\nwhich may in turn impact our resulting costs to our members. Additionally, our models become less reliable the further into the future that the estimates are made. See Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A.\nIn 2018, our generating facilities satisfied approximately 88.3% of our PJM capacity obligation and 57.1% of our energy requirements. We obtained the remainder of our PJM capacity obligation through the PJM RPM capacity auction process and purchased capacity contracts. The energy requirements not met by our owned generating facilities were obtained from multiple suppliers under various long-term and short-term physically-delivered forward power purchase contracts and spot market purchases. See Business-Power Supply Resources\u201d in Item 1 and Properties\u201d in Item 2.\nPJM\nPJM is an RTO that serves all of Delaware and Maryland, and most of Virginia, as well as other areas outside our member distribution cooperatives' service territories. We are a member of PJM and are therefore subject to the operations of PJM. PJM coordinates and establishes policies for the generation, purchase, and sale of capacity and energy in the control areas of its members, including all of the service territories of our member distribution cooperatives. As a result, our generating facilities are under dispatch control of PJM.\nPJM balances its participants' power requirements with the power resources available to supply those requirements. Based on this evaluation of supply and demand, PJM schedules and dispatches available generating facilities throughout its region in a manner intended to meet the demand for energy in the most reliable and cost-effective manner. Thus, PJM directs the dispatch of these facilities even though it does not own them. When PJM cannot dispatch the most economical generating facilities due to transmission constraints, PJM will dispatch more expensive generating facilities to meet power requirements. For these reasons, actions by PJM may materially affect our operating results. PJM compensates us for the capacity of our generating facilities made available without regard to whether our generating facilities are dispatched. See Business-Power Supply Resources-PJM\u201d in Item 1.\nWe transmit power to our member distribution cooperatives through the transmission facilities subject to PJM operational control. We have agreements with PJM which provide us with access to transmission facilities under PJM's control as necessary to deliver energy to our member distribution cooperatives. We own a limited amount of transmission facilities. See Properties-Transmission\u201d in Item 2.\nTransmission owners within PJM have made significant investments in their transmission systems. Because transmission rates are established to recover the cost of investment plus a return on the investment, PJM's rates for network transmission services have increased significantly in recent years. Our transmission costs are impacted each year by billing determinants, which are based on our usage during the peak hour of the year for each transmission area. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Operating Expenses\u201d in Item 7.\nLimited Exception under Wholesale Power Contracts\nWe have a wholesale power contract with each of our member distribution cooperatives. Each contract obligates us to sell and deliver to the member distribution cooperative, and obligates the member distribution cooperative to purchase and receive from us, all power that it requires for the operation of its system, with limited exceptions. One of the limited exceptions permits each of our member distribution cooperatives, with 180 days prior written notice, to receive up to the greater of 5% of its demand and associated energy or 5 MW and associated energy from its owned generation or from other suppliers. If all of our member distribution cooperatives elected to utilize the 5% or 5 MW exception, we estimate the current impact would be a reduction of approximately 176 MW of demand and associated energy. As of May 1, 2018, there was an aggregate of approximately 67 MW remaining that could be utilized under this exception. The following table summarizes the cumulative removal of load requirements under this exception since January 1, 2016.\n \nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> MW\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> May 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> June 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> May 1, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe do not anticipate that either the current or potential full utilization of this exception by our member distribution cooperatives will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. For further discussion on Wholesale Power Contracts, see Business-Members-Member Distribution Cooperatives-Wholesale Power Contracts\u201d in Item 1.\nGenerating Facilities\nOur operating expenses, and consequently our rates to our member distribution cooperatives, are significantly affected by the operations of our generating facilities, which are under dispatch control of PJM. See PJM\u201d above.\nOperational Availability\nThe operational availability of our owned generating resources for the past three years was as follows:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wildcat Point (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North Anna\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 94.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clover\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Louisa\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 93.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marsh Run\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rock Springs (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Wildcat Point achieved commercial operation on April 17, 2018. \n (2) Rock Springs and related assets were sold to EPRS on September 14, 2018. \nCapacity Factor\nThe output of Wildcat Point, North Anna, and Clover for the past three years as a percentage of maximum dependable capacity rating of the facilities, was as follows:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wildcat Point (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North Anna\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clover\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Wildcat Point achieved commercial operation on April 17, 2018. \nDue to outages and economic dispatch by PJM, both units at Clover experienced reduced dispatch during 2018 and 2017.\nEach unit at North Anna is scheduled for refueling approximately every 18 months. While only one unit is refueled at a time, this refueling schedule typically results in both units being off-line for refueling during the same calendar year once every three years. During 2018 and 2017, one unit at North Anna was off-line for refueling. During 2016, both units at North Anna were off-line for refueling.\nSale of Rock Springs Combustion Turbine Facility\nOn September 14, 2018, we sold our interest in Rock Springs and related assets to EPRS for $115 million. Prior to the sale, we and EPRS had each individually owned two natural gas-fired combustion turbine units and a 50% undivided interest in related common facilities at Rock Springs. The transaction resulted in a gain of $42.7 million, which our board of directors approved to defer as a regulatory liability. We amortized $5.0 million of the gain in 2018 and the remaining $37.7 million will be amortized ratably in 2019.\nChanging Environmental Regulation\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation regarding environmental matters. This regulation is becoming increasingly stringent through amendments to federal and state statutes and the development of regulations authorized by existing law. Future federal and state legislation and regulations present the potential for even greater obligations to limit the impact on the environment from the operation of our generating and transmission facilities. See Business-Regulation- Environmental\u201d in Item 1 and Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A.\nSales to Member Distribution Cooperatives\nRevenues from sales to our member distribution cooperatives are a function of our formula rate for sales of power and sales of renewable energy credits to our member distribution cooperatives, and our member distribution cooperatives' customers' requirements for power. See \"-Member Distribution Cooperatives' Requirements for Power\" above. Our formula rate is based on our cost of service in meeting these requirements. See -Formula Rate\u201d above.\nSales to Non-members\nRevenues from sales to non-members consist of sales of excess purchased and generated energy and sales of renewable energy credits. We primarily sell excess energy to PJM under its rates for providing energy imbalance service. Excess energy is the result of changes in our purchased power portfolio, differences between actual and forecasted needs, and changes in market conditions.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Revenues\nOur operating revenues are derived from sales of power and renewable energy credits to our member distribution cooperatives and non-members. Our operating revenues by type of purchaser and our energy sales in MWh for the past three years were as follows:\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td>

18.3%, as compared to 2017. Energy revenues increased $76.6 million, or 18.6%, due to the increase in the average total cost of energy sold to our member distribution cooperatives and an increase in energy sales in MWh to our member distribution cooperatives. The average cost of energy sold to our member distribution cooperatives increased 14.1% due to the 11.1% and 3.7% total energy rate increases we implemented January 1, 2018 and April 1, 2018, respectively. See table below. Energy sales in MWh to our member distribution cooperatives increased 4.0%. Absent the impact of the removal of load under the limited exception under wholesale power contracts beginning May 1, 2018, our energy sales in MWh would have increased by 6.1%. See Factors Affecting Results-Limited Exception Under Wholesale Power Contracts\u201d. Demand revenues increased $57.2 million, or 17.9%, primarily due to the increase in transmission expense and recognition of Wildcat Point expenses related to operations and maintenance, administrative and general, depreciation, and interest charges.\nIn 2017, total revenues from sales to our member distribution cooperatives decreased $115.5 million, or 13.6%, as compared to 2016 primarily due to the decrease in energy revenues. Energy revenues decreased $85.7 million, or 17.2%, due to the 13.3% decrease in the average total cost of energy sold to our member distribution cooperatives and the 4.5% decrease in energy sales in MWh to our member distribution cooperatives. The average cost of energy sold to our member distribution cooperatives was impacted by the rate decreases we implemented in 2016 and 2017 (see table below). The decrease in the volume of energy sales was primarily a result of the reduction in our load requirements related to a limited exception provision in our wholesale power contract and retail choice in Virginia. See Factors Affecting Results-Limited Exception Under Wholesale Power Contracts\u201d. These two events represented a 437,430 MWh load reduction in 2017, as compared to 2016. Additionally, we experienced milder weather in 2017. Demand revenues decreased $29.8 million, or 8.5%, primarily due to decreases in transmission expense and capacity-related purchased power expense, and the recovery of North Anna Unit 3 development costs; partially offset by the deferral of revenue and the increase in the additional equity contribution.\nThe following table summarizes the changes to our total energy rate since 2016, which were implemented to address the differences in our realized as well as projected energy costs:\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> Effective Date of Rate Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> April 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 1, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> April 1, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 1, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-members\nIn 2018, revenues from sales to non-members increased $45.6 million, as compared to the same period in 2017. Revenues from sales of excess energy increased $47.9 million primarily due to the increase in the volume of excess energy sales. We primarily sell excess energy to PJM at the prevailing market price at the time of sale. Excess energy is the result of changes in our purchased power portfolio, differences between actual and forecasted needs, and changes in market conditions.\nIn 2017, revenues from sales to non-members decreased $9.2 million, as compared to the same period in 2016, due to the $5.3 million decrease in revenue from sales of excess energy primarily due to a decrease in the volume of excess energy sales, and the $4.0 million decrease in revenue from sales of renewable energy credits.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following is a summary of the components of our operating expenses for the past three years.\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 187,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 94,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 138,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchased power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 397,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 397,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 408,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transmission\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 135,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 121,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,400\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (43,698\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operations and maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Administrative and general\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of regulatory asset/(liability), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,853\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accretion of asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Taxes, other than income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Operating Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 869,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 713,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 832,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating expenses are comprised of the costs that we incur to generate and purchase power to meet the needs of our member distribution cooperatives, and the costs associated with any sales of power to non-members. Our energy costs generally are variable and include the energy portion of our purchased power expense, fuel expense, and the variable portion of operations and maintenance expense. Our demand costs generally are fixed and include transmission expense, the capacity portion of our purchased power expense, the fixed portion of operations and maintenance expense, administrative and general expense, and depreciation and amortization expense. Additionally, all non-operating expenses and income items, including interest charges, net and investment income, are components of our demand costs. See Factors Affecting Results-Formula Rate\u201d above.\nTotal operating expenses increased $156.1 million, or 21.9%, for 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily as a result of the increases in fuel expense, transmission expense, deferred energy, depreciation and amortization, and operations and maintenance expense, partially offset by the decrease in amortization of regulatory asset/(liability), net.\n \u2022 Fuel expense increased $92.5 million, or 97.8%. Wildcat Point achieved commercial operation on April 17, 2018, and generated 23.0% of our total available energy in 2018. Additionally, generation from our combustion turbine facilities increased 51.3% due to PJM's economic dispatch of the facilities. \n \u2022 Transmission expense increased $38.3 million, or 39.3%, primarily due to increases in PJM charges for network transmission services. \n \u2022 Deferred energy expense increased $21.3 million. In 2018, we under-collected $22.4 million and in 2017 we under-collected $43.7 million. Deferred energy expense represents the difference between energy revenues and energy expenses. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization increased $17.1 million, or 37.6%, primarily due to depreciation expense related to Wildcat Point. \n \u2022 Operations and maintenance expense increased $16.2 million, or 33.4%, primarily due to the commercial operation of Wildcat Point, partially offset by a reduction in expenses related to Clover. \n \u2022 Amortization of regulatory asset/(liability), net decreased $34.1 million. In 2017, our board of directors approved a revenue deferral of $15.0 million, which was recorded as an expense to amortization of regulatory asset/(liability), net. In 2018, we amortized this entire amount. Additionally, we amortized $5.0 million of the $42.7 million gain on the sale of Rock Springs and related assets. \nTotal operating expenses decreased $119.5 million, or 14.4%, for 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily as a result of the decreases in deferred energy, fuel expense, and transmission expense partially offset by the increase in amortization of regulatory asset/(liability), net.\n \u2022 Deferred energy expense decreased $55.9 million. In 2017, we under-collected $43.7 million and in 2016, we over-collected $12.2 million. Deferred energy expense represents the difference between energy revenues and energy expenses. \n \u2022 Fuel expense decreased $43.8 million, or 31.6%. Clover generation decreased 40.5%, due to reduced operational availability as a result of additional outage days and PJM's economic dispatch of the facility. Our combustion turbine facilities generation decreased 31.5% due to PJM's economic dispatch of the facilities. \n \u2022 Transmission expense decreased $24.2 million, or 19.9%, primarily due to a decrease in PJM charges for network transmission services. \n \u2022 Amortization of regulatory asset/(liability), net increased $15.9 million primarily due to our board of directors approval in 2017 of the deferral of $15.0 million in revenue to reduce future revenue requirements and to be amortized ratably in 2018. \nOther Items\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income decreased $4.4 million in 2018, as compared to 2017, primarily due to decreased earnings on our nuclear decommissioning trust. Investment income increased $7.5 million in 2017, as compared to 2016, primarily due to increased earnings on our nuclear decommissioning trust.\nInterest Income on North Anna Unit 3 Cost Recovery\nInterest income on North Anna Unit 3 cost recovery represents interest received from Virginia Power related to the recovery of a portion of our North Anna Unit 3 regulatory asset. In 2015, we recovered 70% of these costs from Virginia Power and, with our board of directors' approval, amortized the remaining balance in 2015. On June 1, 2017, Virginia Power agreed to return the remaining balance of North Anna Unit 3 development costs that we incurred as part of the resolution of other regulatory matters with Virginia Power. The remaining balance of North Anna Unit 3 development costs, including interest through May 2018, totals $11.6 million. In the second quarter of 2017, we recorded $6.9 million as amortization of regulatory asset/liability, net, and $4.4 million as interest income on North Anna Unit 3 cost recovery on our Consolidated Statements of Revenues, Expenses, and Patronage Capital. During the second quarter of 2017, we received a payment of $6.8 million and established a receivable for the remaining balance, which continued to accrue interest until the remaining balance was paid in 2018. See \"Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8.\nInterest Charges, Net\nThe primary factors affecting our interest charges, net are issuance of indebtedness, scheduled payments of principal on our indebtedness, interest charges related to our revolving credit facility, and capitalized interest. The major components of interest charges, net for the past three years were as follows:\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (62,032\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (59,441\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (56,983\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,083\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,384\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,368\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,277\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (809\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,056\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (66,392\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (62,634\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (59,407\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for borrowed funds used during construction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest charges, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (55,222\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (27,040\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (29,133\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2018, interest charges, net increased $28.2 million as compared to the same period in 2017, substantially due to the $24.4 million decrease in allowance for borrowed funds used during construction (capitalized interest) primarily related to Wildcat Point. In 2017, interest charges, net decreased $2.1 million, or 7.2%, as compared to 2016, due to the $5.3 million increase in allowance for borrowed funds used during construction primarily related to Wildcat Point, partially offset by the $3.2 million increase in total interest charges.\nNet Margin Attributable to ODEC\nIn 2018, net margin attributable to ODEC, which is a function of our total interest charges plus any additional equity contributions approved by our board of directors, decreased $13.3 million, primarily as a result of the absence of equity contributions in 2018, as compared to 2017. In 2017, net margin attributable to ODEC, increased $9.0 million, primarily as a result of the $14.1 million equity contribution in 2017, as compared to the $5.8 million equity contribution in 2016. See Factors Affecting Results-Formula Rate\u201d above.\nFinancial Condition\nThe principal changes in our financial condition from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, were caused by increases in property, plant, and equipment, regulatory liability-deferred gain on sale of asset, deferred energy, accounts payable, and decreases in construction work in progress, lease deposits, obligations under long-term lease, revolving credit facility, and regulatory liability-deferred revenue.\n \u2022 Property, plant, and equipment increased $700.3 million, primarily due to the reclassification of Wildcat Point from construction work in progress, partially offset by the decrease related to the sale of our interest in Rock Springs and related assets. \n \u2022 Regulatory liability-deferred gain on sale of asset increased $37.7 million due to the remaining balance of the deferral of the gain on the sale of our interest in Rock Springs and related assets, which will be amortized ratably in 2019. \n \u2022 Deferred energy increased $22.4 million as a result of the under-collection of our energy costs in 2018. The deferred energy balance was an under-collection of $3.7 million and $26.1 million at December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2018, respectively. \n \u2022 Accounts payable increased $21.2 million primarily due to increased construction-related payables. \n \u2022 Construction work in progress decreased $782.6 million primarily due to the reclassification of Wildcat Point to property, plant, and equipment. \n \u2022 Lease deposits and obligations under long-term lease decreased $106.8 million and $103.7 million, respectively, due to the payments related to the Clover lease. \n \u2022 Revolving credit facility decreased $43.4 million due to the repayment of outstanding borrowings under this facility using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our interest in Rock Springs and related assets. \n \u2022 Regulatory liability-deferred revenue decreased $15.0 million due to the amortization in 2018. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources\nCash generated by our operations, periodic borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and occasional issuances of long-term indebtedness provide our sources of liquidity and capital. Additionally, in 2018, we had cash provided by the sale of Rock Springs and related assets.\nOperations\nIn 2018, 2017, and 2016, our operating activities provided cash flows of $58.2 million, $56.5 million, and $88.5 million, respectively.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe maintain a revolving credit facility to cover our short-term and medium-term funding needs that are not met by cash from operations or other available funds. Commitments under this syndicated credit agreement extend until March 1, 2024. Available funding under this facility totals $500 million through March 3, 2022, and $400 million from March 4, 2022 through March 1, 2024. We did not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2018; however, the interest rate on borrowings would have been 3.5%. As of December 31, 2018, we had a $2.5 million letter of credit outstanding under this facility. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding under this facility, $43.4 million in borrowings at a weighted average interest rate of 2.6% and $12.0 million in letters of credit.\nThe syndicated credit agreement contains customary events of default, which, if they occur, would terminate our ability to borrow amounts under this facility and potentially accelerate any outstanding loans under this facility at the election of the lenders. Some of these customary events of default relate to:\n \u2022 our failure to timely pay any principal and interest due under the credit facility; \n \u2022 a breach by us of our representations and warranties in the credit agreement or related documents; \n \u2022 a breach of a covenant contained in the credit agreement, which, in some cases we are given an opportunity to cure and, in certain cases, includes a debt to capitalization financial covenant; \n \u2022 failure to pay, when due, other indebtedness above a specified amount; \n \u2022 an unsatisfied judgment above specified amounts; \n \u2022 bankruptcy or insolvency events relating to us; \n \u2022 invalidity of the credit agreement and related loan documentation or our assertion of invalidity; and \n \u2022 a failure by our member distribution cooperatives to pay amounts in excess of an agreed threshold owing to us beyond a specified cure period. \nFinancings\nWe fund the portion of our capital expenditures that we are not able to fund from operations through borrowings under our revolving credit facility and financings in the debt capital markets. These capital expenditures consist primarily of the costs related to the development, construction, acquisition, or improvement of our owned generating facilities.\nUses\nOur uses of liquidity and capital relate to funding our working capital needs, investment activities, and financing activities. Substantially all of our investment activities relate to capital expenditures in connection with our generating facilities. We expect that cash flow from our operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and financings in the debt capital markets will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated future operational and capital requirements.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe regularly forecast our capital expenditures as part of our long-term business planning activities. We review these projections periodically in order to update our calculations to reflect changes in our future plans, construction costs, market factors, and other items affecting our forecasts. Our actual capital expenditures could vary significantly from these projections. The table below summarizes our actual and projected capital expenditures on a cash flow basis, including capitalized interest, for 2016 through 2021:\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Projected\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wildcat Point\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 232.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North Anna nuclear fuel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North Anna\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clover\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transmission\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Combustion turbine facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 263.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 153.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 77.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNearly all of our capital expenditures consist of additions to electric plant and equipment, particularly for the construction of Wildcat Point. Capital expenditures for North Anna include $4.6 million, $11.1 million, and $13.4 million, for 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively, for costs related to license extension. Capital expenditures for Other include costs related to our administrative and general assets, and distributed generation facilities. We intend to use our cash flow from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and financings in the debt capital markets to fund all of our currently projected capital requirements through 2021.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into long-term arrangements relating to the construction, operation and maintenance of our generating facilities, power purchases for capacity and energy, the financing of our operations, and other matters. See Business-Power Supply Resources-Power Purchase Contracts\u201d in Item 1.

Long-term debt includes both the principal of and interest on long-term debt, and long-term debt due within one year.\nPower Purchase Obligations\nAs part of our power supply strategy, we entered into a number of agreements for the purchase of energy or capacity, or both, in order to meet our member distribution cooperatives' requirements. See Business-Power Supply Resources-Power Purchase Contracts\u201d in Item 1.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe account for our asset retirement obligations in accordance with Accounting for Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at fair value when incurred and capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset. A significant portion of our asset retirement obligations relates to our share of the future costs to decommission North Anna. See Critical Accounting Policies-Accounting for Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations\u201d above.\nOperating Lease Obligations\nOur obligation described above with respect to operating lease obligations relates to our lease for our headquarters building.\nConstruction Obligations\nOur construction obligations include payments related to Wildcat Point EPC contractor payments and major equipment purchase contracts.\nSignificant Contingent Obligations\nIn addition to these existing contractual obligations, we have significant contingent obligations. These obligations primarily relate to power purchase arrangements and our arrangement with TEC. Some of our power purchase contracts obligate us to provide credit support if our obligations issued under the Indenture are rated below specified thresholds by S&P and Moody's.\nPower Purchase Arrangements\nUnder the terms of most of our hedging instruments, we typically agree to provide collateral under certain circumstances and we require comparable terms from our counterparties. The collateral we may be required to post with a counterparty, and vice versa, is normally a function of the collateral thresholds we negotiate with a counterparty relative to a range of credit ratings as well as the value of our transaction(s) under a contract with a respective counterparty. As of December 31, 2018, the collateral we had posted with counterparties pursuant to the hedging instruments we have in place totaled $6.7 million. Typically, collateral thresholds under our contracts are zero once an entity is rated below investment grade by S&P or Moody's (i.e., BBB-\u201d or Baa3,\u201d respectively). As of December 31, 2018, if our credit ratings had been below investment grade we estimate we would have been obligated to post between $250 million and $300 million of collateral with our counterparties. This calculation is based on energy prices on December 31, 2018, and delivered power for which we have not yet paid. Depending on the difference between the price of power under our contracts and the price of power in the market at the time of the calculation, this amount could increase or decrease.\nAdditionally, in accordance with its credit policy, PJM subjects each applicant, participant and member of PJM to a credit evaluation to determine its creditworthiness, and whether it must provide any collateral to support its obligations in connection with its PJM transactions. A material change in our financial condition, including the downgrading of our credit rating by any rating agency, could cause PJM to re-evaluate our creditworthiness and require that we provide collateral. As of December 31, 2018, if PJM had determined that we needed to provide collateral to support our obligations, PJM could have asked us to provide up to approximately $11.4 million as collateral.\nTEC Guarantees\nTEC is considered a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary, and we have consolidated its results and eliminated all intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. To facilitate the ability of TEC to sell power in the market, we have agreed to guarantee up to a maximum of $200 million of TEC's delivery and payment obligations associated with its energy trades, if requested. See Business-Members-TEC\u201d in Item 1. Our agreement to guarantee these obligations continues in effect until we elect to terminate it by providing at least 30 days' prior written notice of termination or until all amounts owed to us by TEC have been paid. Our guarantee of TEC's obligations will enable it to maintain sufficient credit support to meet its delivery and payment obligations associated with its energy trades. As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any guarantees outstanding in support of TEC's obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCaution Regarding Forward-looking Statements\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements regarding matters that could have an impact on our business, financial condition, and future operations. These statements, based on our expectations and estimates, are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors. These risks, uncertainties, and other factors include, but are not limited to, general business conditions, demand for energy, federal and state legislative and regulatory actions and legal and administrative proceedings, changes in and compliance with environmental laws and regulations, general credit and capital market conditions, weather conditions, the cost of commodities used in our industry, and unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures. Our actual results may vary materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of these and other factors. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which the statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.\nOverview\nWe are a not-for-profit power supply cooperative owned entirely by our eleven Class A member distribution cooperatives and a Class B member, TEC. We supply our member distribution cooperatives' energy and demand requirements through a portfolio of resources including generating facilities, long-term and short-term physically-delivered forward power purchase contracts, and spot market energy purchases. We also supply the transmission services necessary to deliver this power to our member distribution cooperatives.\nOur results for the year ended December 31, 2018, were primarily impacted by the commercial operation of Wildcat Point, and weather that resulted in increases in our member distribution cooperatives' requirements for power and the dispatch of our generating facilities. Additionally, in 2018 we increased our total energy rate and completed the sale of our Rock Springs combustion turbine facility and related assets.\n \u2022 Wildcat Point, which achieved commercial operation and was available for dispatch by PJM on April 17, 2018, generated 23.0% of our total available energy in 2018, resulting in increased fuel expense. Once commercial operation was achieved, we began recognizing expenses related to operations and maintenance, administrative and general, depreciation, and interest charges. \n \u2022 Generation from our combustion turbine facilities increased 51.3% as compared to 2017, due to PJM's economic dispatch of these facilities, which resulted in increased fuel expense. \n \u2022 Due to the increased generation from our owned generating facilities, our non-member sales increased as compared to 2017. \n \u2022 Our revenues from sales to our member distribution cooperatives increased 18.3% as compared to 2017. Energy revenues increased 18.6% due to the increase in the average total cost of energy sold to our member distribution cooperatives and an increase in energy sales in MWh to our member distribution cooperatives. The average total cost of energy sold to our member distribution cooperatives increased 14.1% due to the total energy rate increases implemented in 2018. Energy sales in MWh to our member distribution cooperatives increased 4.0%. Demand revenues increased 17.9%, primarily due to the increase in transmission expense and recognition of Wildcat Point-related expenses. \n \u2022 As a result of higher costs, we under-collected energy costs by $52.3 million in the first quarter of 2018. As of March 31, 2018, our deferred energy balance was $55.9 million under-collected. To address the under-collection, we increased our total energy rate 3.7% effective April 1, 2018. As of December 3, 2018, our deferred energy balance was $26.1 million under-collected. \n \u2022 On September 14, 2018, we sold our interest in Rock Springs and related assets for $115 million. We utilized a portion of the funds to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The sale of Rock \n Springs resulted in a gain of $42.7 million, which our board of directors approved to defer as a regulatory liability. We amortized $5.0 million of the gain in 2018 and will amortize the remaining balance in 2019. See Factors Affecting Results-Generating Facilities-Sale of Rock Springs Combustion Turbine Facility.\u201d \nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements reflect the consolidated accounts of ODEC and TEC. See Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that our management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements. We base these estimates and assumptions on information available as of the date of the financial statements. We consider the following accounting policies to be critical accounting policies due to the estimation involved in each.\nAccounting for Regulated Operations\nWe are a rate-regulated entity and, as a result, are subject to the accounting requirements of Accounting for Regulated Operations. In accordance with Accounting for Regulated Operations, certain of our revenues and expenses can be deferred at the discretion of our board of directors, which has budgetary and rate setting authority, if it is probable that these amounts will be collected or returned through our formula rate in future periods. Regulatory assets represent costs that we expect to collect from our member distribution cooperatives based on rates approved by our board of directors in accordance with our formula rate. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in our revenues associated with amounts that we expect to return to our member distribution cooperatives based on rates approved by our board of directors in accordance with our formula rate. See Factors Affecting Results-Formula Rate\u201d below. Regulatory assets are generally included in deferred charges and regulatory liabilities are generally included in deferred credits and other liabilities. Deferred energy, which can be either a regulatory asset or regulatory liability, is included in current assets or current liabilities, respectively. We recognize regulatory assets and liabilities as expenses or as a reduction in expenses, respectively, concurrent with their recovery through rates.\nDeferred Energy\nIn accordance with Accounting for Regulated Operations, we use the deferral method of accounting to recognize differences between our energy expenses and our energy revenues collected from our member distribution cooperatives. Deferred energy on our Consolidated Statements of Revenues, Expenses, and Patronage Capital represents the difference between energy revenues, which are based upon energy rates approved by our board, and energy expenses, which are based upon actual energy costs incurred. The deferred energy balance on our Consolidated Balance Sheet represents the net accumulation of any under- or over-collection of energy costs. Under-collected energy costs appear as an asset and will be collected from our member distribution cooperatives in subsequent periods through our formula rate. Conversely, over-collected energy costs appear as a liability and will be returned to our member distribution cooperatives in subsequent periods through our formula rate.\nMargin Stabilization\nMargin Stabilization allows us to review our actual demand-related costs of service and demand revenues and adjust revenues from our member distribution cooperatives to meet our financial coverage requirements and accumulate additional equity as approved by our board of directors. Our formula rate allows us to collect and return amounts utilizing Margin Stabilization. We record all adjustments, whether increases or decreases, in the year affected and allocate any adjustments to our member distribution cooperatives based on power sales during that year. We collect these increases from our member distribution cooperatives, or offset decreases against amounts owed by our member distribution cooperatives to us, generally in the succeeding calendar year. We adjust operating revenues and accounts receivable-members or accounts payable-members, as appropriate, to reflect these adjustments. These adjustments are treated as due, owed, incurred, and accrued for the year to which the adjustment relates. See Factors Affecting Results-Formula\nRate\u201d below. The following table details the reduction in revenues utilizing Margin Stabilization for the past three years:\n\nAccounting for Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations\nAccounting for Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at fair value when incurred and capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset. In the absence of quoted market prices, we estimate the fair value of our asset retirement obligations using present value techniques, in which estimates of future cash flows associated with retirement activities are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Asset retirement obligations currently reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet were measured during a period of historically low interest rates. The impact on measurements of new asset retirement obligations using different rates in the future may be significant.\nA significant portion of our asset retirement obligations relates to our share of the future costs to decommission North Anna. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our share of North Anna's nuclear decommissioning asset retirement obligation totaled $110.2 million, or 84.5% of total asset retirement obligations, and $105.8 million, or 83.7% of our total asset retirement obligations, respectively. Approximately every four years, a new decommissioning study for North Anna is performed by third-party experts. The third-party experts provide us with periodic site-specific base year\u201d cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost, and timing of planned decommissioning activities for North Anna. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of future cash flows for extended periods are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. In addition, these estimates are dependent on subjective factors, including the selection of cost escalation rates, which we consider to be a critical assumption. Our current estimate is based on a study that was performed in 2014 and adopted effective December 1, 2014. We are not aware of any events that have occurred since the 2014 study that would materially impact our estimate. We anticipate that the next study will be performed in 2019. See \"Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8.\nWe determine cost escalation rates, which represent projected cost increases over time, due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities. The following table details the weighted average cost escalation rates used by the study:\n\nThe weighted average cost escalation rate was applied if the cash flows increased as compared to the previous study. The original weighted average cost escalation rate was applied if the cash flows decreased as compared to the previous study. The use of alternative rates would have been material to the liabilities recognized. For example, had we increased the cost escalation rates by 0.5%, the amount recognized as of December 31, 2018, for our asset retirement obligations related to nuclear decommissioning would have been $21.4 million higher.\nAccounting for Derivatives and Hedging\nWe primarily purchase power under both long-term and short-term physically-delivered forward contracts to supply power to our member distribution cooperatives. These forward purchase contracts meet the accounting definition of a\nderivative; however, a majority of these forward purchase derivative contracts qualify for the normal purchases/normal sales accounting exception under Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging. As a result, these contracts are not recorded at fair value. We record a liability and purchased power expense when the power under the physically-delivered forward contract is delivered. We also purchase natural gas futures generally for three years or less to hedge the price of natural gas for our facilities which utilize natural gas. These derivatives do not qualify for the normal purchases/normal sales accounting exception.\nFor all derivative contracts that do not qualify for the normal purchases/normal sales accounting exception, we defer all unrealized gains and losses on a net basis as a regulatory liability or regulatory asset, respectively, in accordance with Accounting for Regulated Operations. These amounts are subsequently reclassified as purchased power or fuel expense on our Consolidated Statements of Revenues, Expenses, and Patronage Capital as the power or fuel is delivered and/or the contract settles.\nGenerally, derivatives are reported at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheet in the regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities account, and deferred charges-other or deferred credits and other liabilities-other. The measurement of fair value is based on actively quoted market prices, if available. Otherwise, we seek indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications.\nFactors Affecting Results\nMargins\nWe operate on a not-for-profit basis and, accordingly, seek to generate revenues sufficient to recover our cost of service and produce margins sufficient to establish reasonable reserves, meet financial coverage requirements, and accumulate additional equity approved by our board of directors. Revenues in excess of expenses in any year are designated as net margin attributable to ODEC on our Consolidated Statements of Revenues, Expenses, and Patronage Capital. We designate retained net margins attributable to ODEC on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as patronage capital, which we assign to each of our members on the basis of its class of membership and business with us.\nFormula Rate\nOur power sales are comprised of two power products - energy and demand. Energy is the physical electricity delivered through transmission and distribution facilities to customers. We must have sufficient committed energy available to us for delivery to our member distribution cooperatives to meet their maximum energy needs at any time, with limited exceptions. This committed available energy at any time is referred to as demand.\nThe rates we charge our member distribution cooperatives for sales of energy and demand are determined by a formula rate accepted by FERC. On December 2, 2013, FERC accepted our formula rate effective January 1, 2014, subject to refund, and established hearing and settlement procedures. On January 19, 2017, FERC directed us to submit a compliance filing making certain revisions to the formula rate. These revisions to the formula rate did not change our overall revenue requirements. On March 22, 2018, FERC accepted our compliance filing and required us to file a refund report to calculate the difference between rates charged under our rate schedule since January 1, 2014, and rates that would have been charged under the revised rate schedule submitted in our compliance filing. On July 24, 2018, FERC accepted the refund report, which resulted in a reallocation of costs among our member distribution cooperatives and did not result in any change to our operating revenues.\nOur formula rate is intended to permit collection of revenues which will equal the sum of:\n \u2022 all of our costs and expenses; \n \u2022 20% of our total interest charges (margin requirement); and \n \u2022 additional equity contributions approved by our board of directors. \nThe formula rate identifies the cost components that we can collect through rates, but not the actual amounts to be collected. With limited minor exceptions, we can change our rates periodically to match the costs we have incurred and we expect to incur without seeking FERC approval.\nEnergy costs, which are primarily variable costs, such as natural gas, nuclear, and coal fuel costs, and the energy costs under our power purchase contracts with third parties, are recovered through two separate rates, the base energy rate and the energy adjustment rate (collectively referred to as the total energy rate). The base energy rate is developed annually to collect energy costs as estimated in our budget including amounts in the deferred energy account from the prior year. As of January 1 of each year, the base energy rate is reset in accordance with our budget and the energy adjustment rate is reset to zero. We can revise the energy adjustment rate during the year if it becomes apparent that the total energy rate is over-collecting or under-collecting our actual and anticipated energy costs. Any revision to the energy adjustment rate requires board approval and that the resulting change to the total energy rate is at least 2%.\nDemand costs, which are primarily fixed costs, such as depreciation expense, interest expense, administrative and general expenses, capacity costs under power purchase contracts with third parties, transmission costs, margin requirement, and additional equity contributions approved by our board of directors, are recovered through our demand rates. The formula rate allows us to change the actual demand rates we charge as our demand-related costs change, without FERC approval, with the exception of decommissioning cost, which is a fixed number in the formula rate that requires FERC approval prior to any adjustment. FERC approval is also needed to change account classifications currently in the formula or to add accounts not otherwise included in the current formula. Additionally, depreciation studies are required to be filed with FERC for its approval if they would result in a change in our depreciation rates. We collect our total demand costs through the following three separate rates:\n \u2022 transmission service rate - designed to collect transmission-related and distribution-related costs; \n \u2022 RTO capacity service rate - designed to collect capacity costs in PJM that PJM allocates to ODEC and all other PJM members; and \n \u2022 remaining owned capacity service rate - designed to collect all remaining demand costs not billed and/or recovered under the transmission service and RTO capacity service rates. \nAs stated above, our margin requirement, and additional equity contributions approved by our board of directors are recovered through our demand rates. We establish our demand rates to produce a net margin attributable to ODEC equal to 20% of our budgeted total interest charges, plus additional equity contributions approved by our board of directors. The formula rate permits us to adjust revenues from the member distribution cooperatives to equal our actual total demand costs incurred, including a net margin attributable to ODEC equal to 20% of actual interest charges, plus additional equity contributions approved by our board. We make these adjustments utilizing Margin Stabilization. See Critical Accounting Policies-Margin Stabilization\u201d above.\nWe may revise our budget at any time to the extent that our current budget does not accurately reflect our costs and expenses or estimates of our sales of power. Increases or decreases in our budget automatically amend the energy and/or the demand components of our formula rate, as necessary. If at any time our board of directors determines that the formula does not meet all of our costs and expenses, it may adopt a new formula to meet those costs and expenses, subject to any necessary regulatory review and approval.\nRecognition of Revenue\nOur operating revenues reflect the actual demand-related costs we incurred plus the energy costs that we collected. Estimated demand-related costs are collected during the period through the demand components of our formula rate. In accordance with Margin Stabilization, these costs, as well as operating revenues, are adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect actual demand-related costs incurred during that period. See Critical Accounting Policies-Margin Stabilization\u201d above. Estimated energy costs are collected during the period through the energy components of our formula rate. Operating revenues are not adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect actual energy costs incurred during that period. The difference between actual energy costs incurred and energy costs collected during each period is recorded as deferred energy expense, which may be a positive or negative number. See Critical Accounting Policies-Deferred Energy\u201d above.\nWe bill energy to each of our member and non-member customers based on the total MWh delivered to them each month. We bill demand costs through three separate rates: a transmission service rate, an RTO capacity service rate, and a remaining owned capacity service rate. See -Formula Rate\u201d above. The transmission service rate is billed to\neach of our member distribution cooperatives based on its contribution to the single zonal coincident peak (the hour of the month the need for energy is highest) for the prior year within each of the PJM transmission zones. The RTO capacity service rate is billed to each of our member distribution cooperatives based on its contribution to the average of the five hourly PJM coincident peaks in the prior year, subject to add-backs for participation in PJM demand response programs. The remaining owned capacity service rate is billed to each of our member distribution cooperatives based on its contribution to the monthly zonal coincident peak.\nMember Distribution Cooperatives' Requirements for Power\nChanges in the number of customers and those customers' requirements for power significantly affect our member distribution cooperatives' requirements for power. Factors affecting our member distribution cooperatives' requirements for power include:\n \u2022 Weather - Weather affects the demand for electricity. Relatively higher or lower temperatures tend to increase the demand for energy to use air conditioning and heating systems, respectively. Mild weather generally reduces the demand for energy because heating and air conditioning systems are operated less. Weather also plays a role in the price of energy through its effects on the market price for fuel, particularly natural gas. \n \u2022 Heating and cooling degree days are measurement tools used to quantify the need to utilize heating or cooling, respectively, for a building. Heating degree days are calculated as the number of degrees below 60 degrees in a single day. Cooling degree days are calculated as the number of degrees above 65 degrees in a single day. In a single calendar day, it is possible to have multiple heating degree and cooling degree days. \nThe heating and cooling degree days for the past three years were as follows:\n\n \u2022 Economy - General economic conditions have an impact on the rate of growth of our member distribution cooperatives' energy requirements. \n \u2022 Residential growth - Residential growth in our member distribution cooperatives' service territories and increases in consumption levels increase the requirements for power. \n \u2022 Commercial growth - The amount, size, and usage of electronics and machinery and the expansion of operations among our member distribution cooperatives' commercial and industrial customers impact the requirements for power. \n \u2022 Behind-the-meter (distributed generation) resources - Growth in the number of consumers who serve all or a portion of their electricity requirements from resources behind-the-meter, such as solar panels or local micro-grids, reduces the requirements for power. \nFor additional discussion of our member distribution cooperatives' customers, see Members-Member Distribution Cooperatives-Service Territories and Customers\u201d in Item 1.\nPower Supply Resources\nIn an attempt to provide stable power costs to our member distribution cooperatives, we utilize a combination of our owned generating resources and purchases from the market. We also regularly evaluate options for future power sources, including additional owned generation and power purchase contracts.\nMarket forces influence the structure and price of new power supply contracts into which we enter. When we enter into long-term power purchase contracts or agree to purchase energy at a date in the future, we rely on models based on our judgment and assumptions of factors such as future demand for power and market prices of energy and the price of commodities, such as natural gas, used to generate electricity. Our actual results may vary from what our models predict,\nwhich may in turn impact our resulting costs to our members. Additionally, our models become less reliable the further into the future that the estimates are made. See Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A.\nIn 2018, our generating facilities satisfied approximately 88.3% of our PJM capacity obligation and 57.1% of our energy requirements. We obtained the remainder of our PJM capacity obligation through the PJM RPM capacity auction process and purchased capacity contracts. The energy requirements not met by our owned generating facilities were obtained from multiple suppliers under various long-term and short-term physically-delivered forward power purchase contracts and spot market purchases. See Business-Power Supply Resources\u201d in Item 1 and Properties\u201d in Item 2.\nPJM\nPJM is an RTO that serves all of Delaware and Maryland, and most of Virginia, as well as other areas outside our member distribution cooperatives' service territories. We are a member of PJM and are therefore subject to the operations of PJM. PJM coordinates and establishes policies for the generation, purchase, and sale of capacity and energy in the control areas of its members, including all of the service territories of our member distribution cooperatives. As a result, our generating facilities are under dispatch control of PJM.\nPJM balances its participants' power requirements with the power resources available to supply those requirements. Based on this evaluation of supply and demand, PJM schedules and dispatches available generating facilities throughout its region in a manner intended to meet the demand for energy in the most reliable and cost-effective manner. Thus, PJM directs the dispatch of these facilities even though it does not own them. When PJM cannot dispatch the most economical generating facilities due to transmission constraints, PJM will dispatch more expensive generating facilities to meet power requirements. For these reasons, actions by PJM may materially affect our operating results. PJM compensates us for the capacity of our generating facilities made available without regard to whether our generating facilities are dispatched. See Business-Power Supply Resources-PJM\u201d in Item 1.\nWe transmit power to our member distribution cooperatives through the transmission facilities subject to PJM operational control. We have agreements with PJM which provide us with access to transmission facilities under PJM's control as necessary to deliver energy to our member distribution cooperatives. We own a limited amount of transmission facilities. See Properties-Transmission\u201d in Item 2.\nTransmission owners within PJM have made significant investments in their transmission systems. Because transmission rates are established to recover the cost of investment plus a return on the investment, PJM's rates for network transmission services have increased significantly in recent years. Our transmission costs are impacted each year by billing determinants, which are based on our usage during the peak hour of the year for each transmission area. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Operating Expenses\u201d in Item 7.\nLimited Exception under Wholesale Power Contracts\nWe have a wholesale power contract with each of our member distribution cooperatives. Each contract obligates us to sell and deliver to the member distribution cooperative, and obligates the member distribution cooperative to purchase and receive from us, all power that it requires for the operation of its system, with limited exceptions. One of the limited exceptions permits each of our member distribution cooperatives, with 180 days prior written notice, to receive up to the greater of 5% of its demand and associated energy or 5 MW and associated energy from its owned generation or from other suppliers. If all of our member distribution cooperatives elected to utilize the 5% or 5 MW exception, we estimate the current impact would be a reduction of approximately 176 MW of demand and associated energy. As of May 1, 2018, there was an aggregate of approximately 67 MW remaining that could be utilized under this exception. The following table summarizes the cumulative removal of load requirements under this exception since January 1, 2016.\n \n\nWe do not anticipate that either the current or potential full utilization of this exception by our member distribution cooperatives will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. For further discussion on Wholesale Power Contracts, see Business-Members-Member Distribution Cooperatives-Wholesale Power Contracts\u201d in Item 1.\nGenerating Facilities\nOur operating expenses, and consequently our rates to our member distribution cooperatives, are significantly affected by the operations of our generating facilities, which are under dispatch control of PJM. See PJM\u201d above.\nOperational Availability\nThe operational availability of our owned generating resources for the past three years was as follows:\n\n (1) Wildcat Point achieved commercial operation on April 17, 2018. \n (2) Rock Springs and related assets were sold to EPRS on September 14, 2018. \nCapacity Factor\nThe output of Wildcat Point, North Anna, and Clover for the past three years as a percentage of maximum dependable capacity rating of the facilities, was as follows:\n\n (1) Wildcat Point achieved commercial operation on April 17, 2018. \nDue to outages and economic dispatch by PJM, both units at Clover experienced reduced dispatch during 2018 and 2017.\nEach unit at North Anna is scheduled for refueling approximately every 18 months. While only one unit is refueled at a time, this refueling schedule typically results in both units being off-line for refueling during the same calendar year once every three years. During 2018 and 2017, one unit at North Anna was off-line for refueling. During 2016, both units at North Anna were off-line for refueling.\nSale of Rock Springs Combustion Turbine Facility\nOn September 14, 2018, we sold our interest in Rock Springs and related assets to EPRS for $115 million. Prior to the sale, we and EPRS had each individually owned two natural gas-fired combustion turbine units and a 50% undivided interest in related common facilities at Rock Springs. The transaction resulted in a gain of $42.7 million, which our board of directors approved to defer as a regulatory liability. We amortized $5.0 million of the gain in 2018 and the remaining $37.7 million will be amortized ratably in 2019.\nChanging Environmental Regulation\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation regarding environmental matters. This regulation is becoming increasingly stringent through amendments to federal and state statutes and the development of regulations authorized by existing law. Future federal and state legislation and regulations present the potential for even greater obligations to limit the impact on the environment from the operation of our generating and transmission facilities. See Business-Regulation- Environmental\u201d in Item 1 and Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A.\nSales to Member Distribution Cooperatives\nRevenues from sales to our member distribution cooperatives are a function of our formula rate for sales of power and sales of renewable energy credits to our member distribution cooperatives, and our member distribution cooperatives' customers' requirements for power. See \"-Member Distribution Cooperatives' Requirements for Power\" above. Our formula rate is based on our cost of service in meeting these requirements. See -Formula Rate\u201d above.\nSales to Non-members\nRevenues from sales to non-members consist of sales of excess purchased and generated energy and sales of renewable energy credits. We primarily sell excess energy to PJM under its rates for providing energy imbalance service. Excess energy is the result of changes in our purchased power portfolio, differences between actual and forecasted needs, and changes in market conditions.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Revenues\nOur operating revenues are derived from sales of power and renewable energy credits to our member distribution cooperatives and non-members. Our operating revenues by type of purchaser and our energy sales in MWh for the past three years were as follows:\n\nSales of power and renewable energy credits for the past three years were as follows:\n\nMember Distribution Cooperatives\nIn 2018, total revenues from sales to our member distribution cooperatives increased $133.8 million, or 18.3%, as compared to 2017. Energy revenues increased $76.6 million, or 18.6%, due to the increase in the average total cost of energy sold to our member distribution cooperatives and an increase in energy sales in MWh to our member distribution cooperatives. The average cost of energy sold to our member distribution cooperatives increased 14.1% due to the 11.1% and 3.7% total energy rate increases we implemented January 1, 2018 and April 1, 2018, respectively. See table below. Energy sales in MWh to our member distribution cooperatives increased 4.0%. Absent the impact of the removal of load under the limited exception under wholesale power contracts beginning May 1, 2018, our energy sales in MWh would have increased by 6.1%. See Factors Affecting Results-Limited Exception Under Wholesale Power Contracts\u201d. Demand revenues increased $57.2 million, or 17.9%, primarily due to the increase in transmission expense and recognition of Wildcat Point expenses related to operations and maintenance, administrative and general, depreciation, and interest charges.\nIn 2017, total revenues from sales to our member distribution cooperatives decreased $115.5 million, or 13.6%, as compared to 2016 primarily due to the decrease in energy revenues. Energy revenues decreased $85.7 million, or 17.2%, due to the 13.3% decrease in the average total cost of energy sold to our member distribution cooperatives and the 4.5% decrease in energy sales in MWh to our member distribution cooperatives. The average cost of energy sold to our member distribution cooperatives was impacted by the rate decreases we implemented in 2016 and 2017 (see table below). The decrease in the volume of energy sales was primarily a result of the reduction in our load requirements related to a limited exception provision in our wholesale power contract and retail choice in Virginia. See Factors Affecting Results-Limited Exception Under Wholesale Power Contracts\u201d. These two events represented a 437,430 MWh load reduction in 2017, as compared to 2016. Additionally, we experienced milder weather in 2017. Demand revenues decreased $29.8 million, or 8.5%, primarily due to decreases in transmission expense and capacity-related purchased power expense, and the recovery of North Anna Unit 3 development costs; partially offset by the deferral of revenue and the increase in the additional equity contribution.\nThe following table summarizes the changes to our total energy rate since 2016, which were implemented to address the differences in our realized as well as projected energy costs:\n\nNon-members\nIn 2018, revenues from sales to non-members increased $45.6 million, as compared to the same period in 2017. Revenues from sales of excess energy increased $47.9 million primarily due to the increase in the volume of excess energy sales. We primarily sell excess energy to PJM at the prevailing market price at the time of sale. Excess energy is the result of changes in our purchased power portfolio, differences between actual and forecasted needs, and changes in market conditions.\nIn 2017, revenues from sales to non-members decreased $9.2 million, as compared to the same period in 2016, due to the $5.3 million decrease in revenue from sales of excess energy primarily due to a decrease in the volume of excess energy sales, and the $4.0 million decrease in revenue from sales of renewable energy credits.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following is a summary of the components of our operating expenses for the past three years.\n\nOur operating expenses are comprised of the costs that we incur to generate and purchase power to meet the needs of our member distribution cooperatives, and the costs associated with any sales of power to non-members. Our energy costs generally are variable and include the energy portion of our purchased power expense, fuel expense, and the variable portion of operations and maintenance expense. Our demand costs generally are fixed and include transmission expense, the capacity portion of our purchased power expense, the fixed portion of operations and maintenance expense, administrative and general expense, and depreciation and amortization expense. Additionally, all non-operating expenses and income items, including interest charges, net and investment income, are components of our demand costs. See Factors Affecting Results-Formula Rate\u201d above.\nTotal operating expenses increased $156.1 million, or 21.9%, for 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily as a result of the increases in fuel expense, transmission expense, deferred energy, depreciation and amortization, and operations and maintenance expense, partially offset by the decrease in amortization of regulatory asset/(liability), net.\n \u2022 Fuel expense increased $92.5 million, or 97.8%. Wildcat Point achieved commercial operation on April 17, 2018, and generated 23.0% of our total available energy in 2018. Additionally, generation from our combustion turbine facilities increased 51.3% due to PJM's economic dispatch of the facilities. \n \u2022 Transmission expense increased $38.3 million, or 39.3%, primarily due to increases in PJM charges for network transmission services. \n \u2022 Deferred energy expense increased $21.3 million. In 2018, we under-collected $22.4 million and in 2017 we under-collected $43.7 million. Deferred energy expense represents the difference between energy revenues and energy expenses. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization increased $17.1 million, or 37.6%, primarily due to depreciation expense related to Wildcat Point. \n \u2022 Operations and maintenance expense increased $16.2 million, or 33.4%, primarily due to the commercial operation of Wildcat Point, partially offset by a reduction in expenses related to Clover. \n \u2022 Amortization of regulatory asset/(liability), net decreased $34.1 million. In 2017, our board of directors approved a revenue deferral of $15.0 million, which was recorded as an expense to amortization of regulatory asset/(liability), net. In 2018, we amortized this entire amount. Additionally, we amortized $5.0 million of the $42.7 million gain on the sale of Rock Springs and related assets. \nTotal operating expenses decreased $119.5 million, or 14.4%, for 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily as a result of the decreases in deferred energy, fuel expense, and transmission expense partially offset by the increase in amortization of regulatory asset/(liability), net.\n \u2022 Deferred energy expense decreased $55.9 million. In 2017, we under-collected $43.7 million and in 2016, we over-collected $12.2 million. Deferred energy expense represents the difference between energy revenues and energy expenses. \n \u2022 Fuel expense decreased $43.8 million, or 31.6%. Clover generation decreased 40.5%, due to reduced operational availability as a result of additional outage days and PJM's economic dispatch of the facility. Our combustion turbine facilities generation decreased 31.5% due to PJM's economic dispatch of the facilities. \n \u2022 Transmission expense decreased $24.2 million, or 19.9%, primarily due to a decrease in PJM charges for network transmission services. \n \u2022 Amortization of regulatory asset/(liability), net increased $15.9 million primarily due to our board of directors approval in 2017 of the deferral of $15.0 million in revenue to reduce future revenue requirements and to be amortized ratably in 2018. \nOther Items\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income decreased $4.4 million in 2018, as compared to 2017, primarily due to decreased earnings on our nuclear decommissioning trust. Investment income increased $7.5 million in 2017, as compared to 2016, primarily due to increased earnings on our nuclear decommissioning trust.\nInterest Income on North Anna Unit 3 Cost Recovery\nInterest income on North Anna Unit 3 cost recovery represents interest received from Virginia Power related to the recovery of a portion of our North Anna Unit 3 regulatory asset. In 2015, we recovered 70% of these costs from Virginia Power and, with our board of directors' approval, amortized the remaining balance in 2015. On June 1, 2017, Virginia Power agreed to return the remaining balance of North Anna Unit 3 development costs that we incurred as part of the resolution of other regulatory matters with Virginia Power. The remaining balance of North Anna Unit 3 development costs, including interest through May 2018, totals $11.6 million. In the second quarter of 2017, we recorded $6.9 million as amortization of regulatory asset/liability, net, and $4.4 million as interest income on North Anna Unit 3 cost recovery on our Consolidated Statements of Revenues, Expenses, and Patronage Capital. During the second quarter of 2017, we received a payment of $6.8 million and established a receivable for the remaining balance, which continued to accrue interest until the remaining balance was paid in 2018. See \"Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8.\nInterest Charges, Net\nThe primary factors affecting our interest charges, net are issuance of indebtedness, scheduled payments of principal on our indebtedness, interest charges related to our revolving credit facility, and capitalized interest. The major components of interest charges, net for the past three years were as follows:\n\nIn 2018, interest charges, net increased $28.2 million as compared to the same period in 2017, substantially due to the $24.4 million decrease in allowance for borrowed funds used during construction (capitalized interest) primarily related to Wildcat Point. In 2017, interest charges, net decreased $2.1 million, or 7.2%, as compared to 2016, due to the $5.3 million increase in allowance for borrowed funds used during construction primarily related to Wildcat Point, partially offset by the $3.2 million increase in total interest charges.\nNet Margin Attributable to ODEC\nIn 2018, net margin attributable to ODEC, which is a function of our total interest charges plus any additional equity contributions approved by our board of directors, decreased $13.3 million, primarily as a result of the absence of equity contributions in 2018, as compared to 2017. In 2017, net margin attributable to ODEC, increased $9.0 million, primarily as a result of the $14.1 million equity contribution in 2017, as compared to the $5.8 million equity contribution in 2016. See Factors Affecting Results-Formula Rate\u201d above.\nFinancial Condition\nThe principal changes in our financial condition from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, were caused by increases in property, plant, and equipment, regulatory liability-deferred gain on sale of asset, deferred energy, accounts payable, and decreases in construction work in progress, lease deposits, obligations under long-term lease, revolving credit facility, and regulatory liability-deferred revenue.\n \u2022 Property, plant, and equipment increased $700.3 million, primarily due to the reclassification of Wildcat Point from construction work in progress, partially offset by the decrease related to the sale of our interest in Rock Springs and related assets. \n \u2022 Regulatory liability-deferred gain on sale of asset increased $37.7 million due to the remaining balance of the deferral of the gain on the sale of our interest in Rock Springs and related assets, which will be amortized ratably in 2019. \n \u2022 Deferred energy increased $22.4 million as a result of the under-collection of our energy costs in 2018. The deferred energy balance was an under-collection of $3.7 million and $26.1 million at December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2018, respectively. \n \u2022 Accounts payable increased $21.2 million primarily due to increased construction-related payables. \n \u2022 Construction work in progress decreased $782.6 million primarily due to the reclassification of Wildcat Point to property, plant, and equipment. \n \u2022 Lease deposits and obligations under long-term lease decreased $106.8 million and $103.7 million, respectively, due to the payments related to the Clover lease. \n \u2022 Revolving credit facility decreased $43.4 million due to the repayment of outstanding borrowings under this facility using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our interest in Rock Springs and related assets. \n \u2022 Regulatory liability-deferred revenue decreased $15.0 million due to the amortization in 2018. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources\nCash generated by our operations, periodic borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and occasional issuances of long-term indebtedness provide our sources of liquidity and capital. Additionally, in 2018, we had cash provided by the sale of Rock Springs and related assets.\nOperations\nIn 2018, 2017, and 2016, our operating activities provided cash flows of $58.2 million, $56.5 million, and $88.5 million, respectively.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe maintain a revolving credit facility to cover our short-term and medium-term funding needs that are not met by cash from operations or other available funds. Commitments under this syndicated credit agreement extend until March 1, 2024. Available funding under this facility totals $500 million through March 3, 2022, and $400 million from March 4, 2022 through March 1, 2024. We did not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2018; however, the interest rate on borrowings would have been 3.5%. As of December 31, 2018, we had a $2.5 million letter of credit outstanding under this facility. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding under this facility, $43.4 million in borrowings at a weighted average interest rate of 2.6% and $12.0 million in letters of credit.\nThe syndicated credit agreement contains customary events of default, which, if they occur, would terminate our ability to borrow amounts under this facility and potentially accelerate any outstanding loans under this facility at the election of the lenders. Some of these customary events of default relate to:\n \u2022 our failure to timely pay any principal and interest due under the credit facility; \n \u2022 a breach by us of our representations and warranties in the credit agreement or related documents; \n \u2022 a breach of a covenant contained in the credit agreement, which, in some cases we are given an opportunity to cure and, in certain cases, includes a debt to capitalization financial covenant; \n \u2022 failure to pay, when due, other indebtedness above a specified amount; \n \u2022 an unsatisfied judgment above specified amounts; \n \u2022 bankruptcy or insolvency events relating to us; \n \u2022 invalidity of the credit agreement and related loan documentation or our assertion of invalidity; and \n \u2022 a failure by our member distribution cooperatives to pay amounts in excess of an agreed threshold owing to us beyond a specified cure period. \nFinancings\nWe fund the portion of our capital expenditures that we are not able to fund from operations through borrowings under our revolving credit facility and financings in the debt capital markets. These capital expenditures consist primarily of the costs related to the development, construction, acquisition, or improvement of our owned generating facilities.\nUses\nOur uses of liquidity and capital relate to funding our working capital needs, investment activities, and financing activities. Substantially all of our investment activities relate to capital expenditures in connection with our generating facilities. We expect that cash flow from our operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and financings in the debt capital markets will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated future operational and capital requirements.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe regularly forecast our capital expenditures as part of our long-term business planning activities. We review these projections periodically in order to update our calculations to reflect changes in our future plans, construction costs, market factors, and other items affecting our forecasts. Our actual capital expenditures could vary significantly from these projections. The table below summarizes our actual and projected capital expenditures on a cash flow basis, including capitalized interest, for 2016 through 2021:\n\nNearly all of our capital expenditures consist of additions to electric plant and equipment, particularly for the construction of Wildcat Point. Capital expenditures for North Anna include $4.6 million, $11.1 million, and $13.4 million, for 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively, for costs related to license extension. Capital expenditures for Other include costs related to our administrative and general assets, and distributed generation facilities. We intend to use our cash flow from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and financings in the debt capital markets to fund all of our currently projected capital requirements through 2021.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into long-term arrangements relating to the construction, operation and maintenance of our generating facilities, power purchases for capacity and energy, the financing of our operations, and other matters. See Business-Power Supply Resources-Power Purchase Contracts\u201d in Item 1. The following table summarizes our long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\n\nWe expect to fund these obligations with cash flow from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and financings in the debt capital markets.\nLong-term Debt Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2018, our long-term debt obligations include long-term debt issued privately and to the public under the Indenture. Long-term debt includes both the principal of and interest on long-term debt, and long-term debt due within one year.\nPower Purchase Obligations\nAs part of our power supply strategy, we entered into a number of agreements for the purchase of energy or capacity, or both, in order to meet our member distribution cooperatives' requirements. See Business-Power Supply Resources-Power Purchase Contracts\u201d in Item 1.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe account for our asset retirement obligations in accordance with Accounting for Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at fair value when incurred and capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset. A significant portion of our asset retirement obligations relates to our share of the future costs to decommission North Anna. See Critical Accounting Policies-Accounting for Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations\u201d above.\nOperating Lease Obligations\nOur obligation described above with respect to operating lease obligations relates to our lease for our headquarters building.\nConstruction Obligations\nOur construction obligations include payments related to Wildcat Point EPC contractor payments and major equipment purchase contracts.\nSignificant Contingent Obligations\nIn addition to these existing contractual obligations, we have significant contingent obligations. These obligations primarily relate to power purchase arrangements and our arrangement with TEC. Some of our power purchase contracts obligate us to provide credit support if our obligations issued under the Indenture are rated below specified thresholds by S&P and Moody's.\nPower Purchase Arrangements\nUnder the terms of most of our hedging instruments, we typically agree to provide collateral under certain circumstances and we require comparable terms from our counterparties. The collateral we may be required to post with a counterparty, and vice versa, is normally a function of the collateral thresholds we negotiate with a counterparty relative to a range of credit ratings as well as the value of our transaction(s) under a contract with a respective counterparty. As of December 31, 2018, the collateral we had posted with counterparties pursuant to the hedging instruments we have in place totaled $6.7 million. Typically, collateral thresholds under our contracts are zero once an entity is rated below investment grade by S&P or Moody's (i.e., BBB-\u201d or Baa3,\u201d respectively). As of December 31, 2018, if our credit ratings had been below investment grade we estimate we would have been obligated to post between $250 million and $300 million of collateral with our counterparties. This calculation is based on energy prices on December 31, 2018, and delivered power for which we have not yet paid. Depending on the difference between the price of power under our contracts and the price of power in the market at the time of the calculation, this amount could increase or decrease.\nAdditionally, in accordance with its credit policy, PJM subjects each applicant, participant and member of PJM to a credit evaluation to determine its creditworthiness, and whether it must provide any collateral to support its obligations in connection with its PJM transactions. A material change in our financial condition, including the downgrading of our credit rating by any rating agency, could cause PJM to re-evaluate our creditworthiness and require that we provide collateral. As of December 31, 2018, if PJM had determined that we needed to provide collateral to support our obligations, PJM could have asked us to provide up to approximately $11.4 million as collateral.\nTEC Guarantees\nTEC is considered a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary, and we have consolidated its results and eliminated all intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. To facilitate the ability of TEC to sell power in the market, we have agreed to guarantee up to a maximum of $200 million of TEC's delivery and payment obligations associated with its energy trades, if requested. See Business-Members-TEC\u201d in Item 1. Our agreement to guarantee these obligations continues in effect until we elect to terminate it by providing at least 30 days' prior written notice of termination or until all amounts owed to us by TEC have been paid. Our guarantee of TEC's obligations will enable it to maintain sufficient credit support to meet its delivery and payment obligations associated with its energy trades. As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any guarantees outstanding in support of TEC's obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.", "item_7_tables":

cooperative that supplies energy to 11 member distribution cooperatives.\n- Key factors impacting 2018 results were the commercial operation of the Wildcat Point plant, weather-driven increases in energy demand, rate increases, and the sale of the Rock Springs plant.\n\nRevenues \n- Revenues from member distribution cooperatives were up 18.3% in 2018 driven by higher average energy costs and increased demand.\n- Non-member revenues rose due to higher volumes of excess energy sales.\n\nExpenses\n- Total operating expenses rose 21.9% in 2018 primarily due to increases in fuel costs, transmission expense, depreciation, and operations and maintenance costs related to Wildcat Point.\n\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\n- Cash from operations, credit facility borrowings, and debt issuances fund operations, capital expenditures, and debt repayments.  \n- Wildcat Point construction was a major capital expenditure through 2018. Other projected capital expenditures 2019-2021 total $183 million.\n- Long-term debt obligations total $2.1 billion through 2024+.\n\nKey Contractual Obligations\n- $2.8 billion in total long-term obligations including debt, power purchases, asset retirement costs, leases, and construction commitments.\n\nSo in summary, commercial operation of Wildcat Point and member load growth drove increased 2018 revenues and expenses. Liquidity remains stable with cash from operations and financing funding major capital expenditures in the near term."}
