Consolidated (the Company\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company's fiscal year generally ends on the Sunday closest to December 31 of each year. The fiscal years presented are:\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The 52-week period ended January 1, 2017 ( 2016\u201d)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The 53-week period ended January 3, 2016 ( 2015\u201d); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The 52-week period ended December 28, 2014 ( 2014\u201d).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe estimated net sales, gross profit and S,D&A expenses for the additional selling week in 2015 were approximately $39 million, $14 million and $10 million, respectively, and were included in reported results in 2015.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the consolidated operations of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries including Piedmont Coca-Cola Bottling Partnership ( Piedmont\u201d). Piedmont is the Company's only subsidiary that has a significant noncontrolling interest. Piedmont distributes and markets nonalcoholic beverages in portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. The Company provides a portion of the nonalcoholic beverage products to Piedmont at cost and receives a fee for managing the operations of Piedmont pursuant to a management agreement. Noncontrolling interest consists of The Coca-Cola Company's interest in Piedmont, which was 22.7% for all periods presented.\nExpansion Transactions with The Coca-Cola Company\nAs part of The Coca-Cola Company's plans to refranchise its North American bottling territories, the Company has engaged in a multi-year series of transactions since April 2013 with The Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. ( CCR\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company, to significantly expand the Company's distribution and manufacturing operations. This expansion includes acquisition of rights to serve additional distribution territories previously served by CCR (the Expansion Territories\u201d) and of related distribution assets (the Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions\u201d), as well as the acquisition of regional manufacturing facilities ( Regional Manufacturing Facilities\u201d) and related manufacturing assets previously owned by CCR (the Manufacturing Facility Expansion Transactions\u201d and, together with the Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions, the Expansion Transactions\u201d).\nDistribution Territory Expansion Transactions\nIn April 2013, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent with The Coca-Cola Company to acquire Expansion Territories in parts of Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana, all of which were acquired by the second quarter of 2015.\nIn May 2015, the Company completed an exchange transaction with CCR through which the Company acquired certain assets and rights for territory in Lexington, Kentucky from CCR and transferred certain assets and rights for territory in Jackson, Tennessee to CCR. The assets exchanged relate to the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of Coca-Cola and other beverage products in each territory, including the rights to produce such beverages in each territory included in the exchange.\nIn May 2015, the Company also entered into a second non-binding letter of intent (the May 2015 LOI\u201d) with The Coca-Cola Company to acquire Expansion Territories in Baltimore, Maryland; Alexandria, Norfolk and Richmond, Virginia; the District of Columbia; Cincinnati, Columbus and Dayton, Ohio; and Indianapolis, Indiana. Pursuant to the May 2015 LOI, CCR would:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (i)\n</td> <td> Grant the Company in two phases certain exclusive rights for the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of The Coca-Cola Company-owned and licensed products in additional territories served by CCR; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (ii)\n</td> <td> Sell the Company certain assets that included rights to distribute those cross-licensed brands distributed in the territories by CCR as well as the assets used by CCR in the distribution of the cross-licensed brands and The Coca-Cola Company brands.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe first phase of the additional Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions contemplated by the May 2015 LOI was agreed upon in an asset purchase agreement entered into by the Company and CCR in September 2015 (the September 2015 APA\u201d). The September 2015 APA included Expansion Territory in: (i) eastern and northern Virginia, (ii) the entire state of Maryland, (iii) the District of Columbia, and (iv) parts of Delaware, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and was completed by the second quarter of 2016. Following is a summary of key closing dates for the transactions covered by the September 2015 APA:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> October 30, 2015 - The first closing under the September 2015 APA occurred for territories served by distribution facilities in Norfolk, Fredericksburg and Staunton, Virginia and Elizabeth City, North Carolina.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> January 29, 2016 - The second closing under the September 2015 APA occurred for territories served by distribution facilities in Easton and Salisbury, Maryland and Richmond and Yorktown, Virginia.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> April 1, 2016 - The third closing under the September 2015 APA occurred for territories served by distribution facilities in Capitol Heights and La Plata, Maryland and Alexandria, Virginia.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> April 29, 2016 - The final closing under the September 2015 APA occurred for territories served by distribution facilities in Baltimore, Cumberland and Hagerstown, Maryland.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn September 1, 2016, the Company and CCR entered into an asset purchase agreement (the September 2016 Distribution APA\u201d) for the second phase of the additional distribution territory contemplated by the May 2015 LOI and for a portion of the additional distribution territory contemplated by the CCR June 2016 LOI, including territories located in (i) central and southern Ohio, (ii) northern Kentucky, (iii) large portions of Indiana and (iv) parts of Illinois and West Virginia that are currently served by CCR. Following is a summary of key closing dates for the transactions covered by the September 2016 Distribution APA:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> October 28, 2016 - The first closing under the September 2016 Distribution APA occurred for territories served by distribution facilities in Cincinnati, Dayton, Lima and Portsmouth, Ohio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> January 27, 2017 - Subsequent to the end of 2016, the second closing under the September 2016 Distribution APA occurred for territories served by distribution facilities in Anderson, Fort Wayne, Lafayette, South Bend and Terre Haute, Indiana.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt each of the closings under the September 2015 APA and the September 2016 Distribution APA, the Company entered into a comprehensive beverage agreement with CCR in substantially the same form as the form of comprehensive beverage agreement currently in effect in the territories acquired in the earlier Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions (the Initial CBA\u201d) which requires the Company to make a quarterly sub-bottling payment to CCR on a continuing basis for the grant of exclusive rights to distribute, promote, market and sell the Covered Beverages and Related Products, as defined in the Initial CBA, in the applicable territories.\nManufacturing Facility Expansion Transactions\nThe May 2015 LOI contemplated, among other things, that The Coca-Cola Company would work collaboratively with the Company and certain other expanding participating bottlers in the U.S. to implement a national product supply system. As a result of subsequent discussions with The Coca-Cola Company, in September 2015, the Company and The Coca-Cola Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent (the September 2016 LOI\u201d) pursuant to which CCR would sell six Regional Manufacturing Facilities and related manufacturing assets (collectively, the Manufacturing Assets\u201d) to the Company as the Company becomes a regional producing bottler ( Regional Producing Bottler\u201d) in the national product supply system. Similar to, and as an integral part of, the Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions described in the May 2015 LOI, the sale of the Manufacturing Assets by CCR to the Company would be accomplished in two phases: (i) the first phase would include three Regional Manufacturing Facilities located in Sandston, Virginia; Silver Spring, Maryland; and Baltimore, Maryland and (ii) the second phase would include three Regional Manufacturing Facilities located in Indianapolis, Indiana; Portland Indiana; and Cincinnati, Ohio.\nOn October 30, 2015, the Company and CCR entered into an asset purchase agreement (the October 2015 APA\u201d) for the first phase of the Regional Manufacturing Facilities acquisitions contemplated by the September 2015 LOI, including Regional Manufacturing Facilities located in Sandston, Virginia; Silver Spring, Maryland; and Baltimore, Maryland, and was completed by the second quarter of 2016. Following is a summary of key closing dates for the transactions covered by the October 2015 APA:\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> January 29, 2016 - The first closing under the October 2015 APA occurred for the Sandston, Virginia facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> April 29, 2016 - The interim and final closings under the October 2015 APA occurred for the acquisition of Regional Manufacturing Facilities located in Silver Spring, Maryland and Baltimore, Maryland.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn September 1, 2016, the Company and CCR entered into an asset purchase agreement (the September 2016 Manufacturing APA\u201d) for the second phase of the Regional Manufacturing Facility acquisitions contemplated by the September 2015 LOI which included Regional Manufacturing Facilities located in Indianapolis, Indiana; Portland, Indiana; and Cincinnati, Ohio. On October 28, 2016, the first closing under the September 2016 Manufacturing APA occurred for the Regional Manufacturing Facility in Cincinnati, Ohio.\nThe rights for the manufacture, production and packaging of specified beverages at the Regional Manufacturing Facilities acquired by the Company have been granted by The Coca-Cola Company to the Company pursuant to an initial regional manufacturing agreement in the form disclosed in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 5, 2016 (the Initial RMA\u201d). Pursuant to its terms, the Initial RMA will be amended, restated and converted into a final form of regional manufacturing agreement (the Final RMA\u201d) concurrent with the conversion of the Company's Bottling Agreements (as defined below) to the Final CBA as described in the description of the Territory Conversion Agreement (defined and described below).\nUnder the Final RMA, the Company's aggregate business directly and primarily related to the manufacture of Authorized Covered Beverages, permitted cross-licensed brands and other beverages and beverage products for The Coca-Cola Company will be subject to the same agreed upon sale process provisions included in the Final CBA as described below, which include the need to obtain The Coca-Cola Company's prior approval of a potential purchaser of such manufacturing business. The Coca-Cola Company will also have the right to terminate the Final RMA in the event of an uncured default by the Company.\nAnnapolis Make-Ready Center Acquisition\nAs a part of the Expansion Transactions, on October 30, 2015, the Company acquired from CCR a make-ready center\u201d in Annapolis, Maryland for a cash purchase price of $5.4 million, which includes all post-closing adjustments. The Company recorded a bargain purchase gain of approximately $2.0 million on this transaction after applying a deferred tax liability of approximately $1.3 million. The Company uses the make-ready center to deploy and refurbish vending and other sales equipment for use in the marketplace.\nThe net cash purchase price for each of the Expansion Transactions, which includes both Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions and Manufacturing Facility Expansion Transactions, completed as of January 1, 2017, is as follows:\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> Territory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Acquisition / Exchange Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Cash\nPurchase Price\n(In Millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Johnson City and Morristown, Tennessee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> May 23, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Knoxville, Tennessee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 24, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cleveland and Cookeville, Tennessee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Louisville, Kentucky and Evansville, Indiana\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 27, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Paducah and Pikeville, Kentucky\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> May 1, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lexington, Kentucky for Jackson, Tennessee Exchange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> May 1, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Norfolk, Fredericksburg and Staunton, Virginia and Elizabeth City, North Carolina\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Annapolis, Maryland Make-Ready Center\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Easton and Salisbury, Maryland, Richmond and Yorktown, Virginia, and Sandston, Virginia Regional Manufacturing Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 29, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Alexandria, Virginia and Capitol Heights and La Plata, Maryland\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Baltimore, Hagerstown and Cumberland, Maryland, and Silver Spring and Baltimore, Maryland Regional Manufacturing Facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 29, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cincinnati, Dayton, Lima and Portsmouth, Ohio and Louisa, Kentucky and Cincinnati, Ohio Regional Manufacturing Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 28, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> *\n</td> <td> NOTE: The cash purchase price amounts are subject to a final post-closing adjustment and, as a result, may either increase or decrease.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe financial results of the Expansion Transactions, Expansion Territories and Lexington Expansion Territory have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition or exchange dates.

Pursuant to the CCR June 2016 LOI, CCR would:\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (i)\n</td> <td> Grant the Company exclusive rights for the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of The Coca-Cola Company-owned and -licensed products in additional territories in northeastern Kentucky and southwestern West Virginia served by CCR's distribution center in Louisa, Kentucky;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (ii)\n</td> <td> Sell the Company certain assets that included rights to distribute those cross-licensed brands distributed in the territories by CCR as well as the assets used by CCR in the distribution of the cross-licensed brands and The Coca-Cola Company brands; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (iii)\n</td> <td> Transfer exclusive rights and associated distribution assets and working capital for territory in parts of Arkansas, southwestern Tennessee and northwestern Mississippi and two additional Regional Manufacturing Facilities located in Memphis, Tennessee and West Memphis, Arkansas currently owned by CCR in exchange for territory in southern Alabama, southern Mississippi and southern Georgia and a Regional Manufacturing Facility in Mobile, Alabama currently owned by the Company. The exchange includes rights to the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of The Coca-Cola Company-owned and -licensed products and certain cross-licensed brands in each territory and related Manufacturing Assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn June 2016, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Coca-Cola Bottling Company United, Inc. ( United\u201d), an independent bottler that is unrelated to the Company (the United June 2016 LOI\u201d). Pursuant to this letter of intent, United would transfer exclusive rights and associated distribution assets and working capital in certain territory in and around Spartanburg and Bluffton, South Carolina, currently served by United's distribution centers located in Spartanburg, South Carolina and Savannah, Georgia, in exchange for certain territory in south-central Tennessee, northwest Alabama and northwest Florida currently served by the Company's distribution centers located in Florence, Alabama and Panama City, Florida. The exchange includes rights to the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of The Coca-Cola Company-owned and -licensed products and certain cross-licensed brands in each territory.\nAs discussed above, on October 28, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of territories served by the distribution facility in Louisa, Kentucky contemplated by the CCR June 2016 LOI. The Company is continuing to work towards a definitive agreement or agreements with The Coca-Cola Company and CCR for the remaining proposed Expansion Transactions described in the February 2016 LOI and the CCR June 2016 LOI. The Company is also continuing to work towards a definitive agreement or agreements with United for the proposed transactions described in the United June 2016 LOI.\nNational Product Supply Governance Agreement (the NPSG Governance Agreement\u201d)\nIn October 2015, the Company, The Coca-Cola Company and three other Coca-Cola bottlers, including CCR, who are considered Regional Producing Bottlers\u201d ( RPBs\u201d) in The Coca-Cola Company's national product supply system, entered into the NPSG Governance Agreement. Pursuant to the NPSG Governance Agreement, The Coca-Cola Company and the RPBs have formed a national product supply group (the NPSG\u201d) and agreed to certain binding governance mechanisms, including a governing board (the NPSG Board\u201d) comprised of a representative of (i) the Company, (ii) The Coca-Cola Company and (iii) each other Regional Producing Bottler. As The Coca-Cola Company continues its multi-year refranchising effort of its North American bottling territories, additional Regional Producing Bottlers may be added to the NPSG Board. As of January 2017, the NPSG Board consisted of The Coca-Cola-Company, the Company and five other RPBs, including CCR.\nThe stated objectives of the NPSG include, among others, (i) Coca-Cola system strategic infrastructure investment and divestment planning; (ii) network optimization of all plant to distribution center sourcing; and (iii) new product/packaging infrastructure planning.\nThe NPSG Board makes and/or oversees and directs certain key decisions regarding the NPSG, including decisions regarding the management and staffing of the NPSG and the funding for the ongoing operations of the NPSG. The Company is obligated to pay a certain portion of the costs of operating the NPSG. Pursuant to the decisions of the NPSG Board made from time to time and subject to the terms and conditions of the NPSG Governance Agreement, the Company and each other Regional Producing Bottler will make investments in their respective manufacturing assets and will implement Coca-Cola system strategic investment opportunities that are consistent with the NPSG Governance Agreement.\nTerritory Conversion Agreement\nConcurrent with their execution of the September 2015 APA, the Company, CCR and The Coca-Cola Company executed a territory conversion agreement (as amended February 8, 2016, the Territory Conversion Agreement\u201d), which provides that, subject to certain exceptions, all of the Company's master bottle contracts, allied bottle contracts, Initial CBAs and other bottling agreements with The Coca-Cola Company or CCR that authorize the Company to produce and/or distribute the Covered Beverages or Related Products, as defined therein, (collectively, the Bottling Agreements\u201d) would be amended, restated and converted, upon the occurrence of certain events described below, to a new and final comprehensive beverage agreement (the Final CBA\u201d).\nThe conversion would include all of the Company's then existing Bottling Agreements in the Expansion Territories and all other territories in the United States where the Company has rights to market, promote, distribute and sell beverage products owned or licensed by The Coca-Cola Company (the Legacy Territories\u201d), but would not affect any Bottling Agreements with respect to the greater Lexington, Kentucky territory. At the time of the conversion of the Bottling Agreements for the Legacy Territories to the Final CBA, CCR will pay a fee to the Company in cash, or another mutually agreed form of payment or credit, in an amount equivalent to 0.5 times the EBITDA the Company generates from sales in the Legacy Territories of Beverages (as defined in the Final CBA) either (i) owned by The Coca-Cola Company or licensed to The Coca-Cola Company and sublicensed to the Company, or (ii) owned by or licensed to Monster Energy Company ( Monster\u201d) on which the Company pays, and The Coca-Cola Company receives, a facilitation fee.\nThe Company may elect to cause the conversion of the Bottling Agreements to the Final CBA to occur at any time by giving written notice to The Coca-Cola Company. As the transactions contemplated by the September 2015 APA have now been consummated, the conversion will occur automatically upon the earliest of (i) the consummation of all remaining transactions described in the September 2016 Distribution APA (the Subsequent Phase Territory Transactions\u201d), (ii) January 1, 2020, as long as The Coca-Cola Company has satisfied certain obligations described in the Territory Conversion Agreement regarding its intent to complete the Subsequent Phase Territory Transactions, or (iii) 30 days following the Company's (a) termination of good faith negotiations of the Subsequent Phase Territory Transactions on terms similar to the terms for the transactions completed under the September 2015 APA or (b) notification that it no longer wants to pursue the Subsequent Phase Territory Transactions.\nThe Final CBA is similar to the Initial CBA in many respects, but also includes certain modifications and several new business, operational and governance provisions. For example, the Final CBA contains provisions that apply in the event of a potential sale of the Company or its aggregate businesses directly and primarily related to the marketing, promotion, distribution, and sale of Covered Beverages and Related Products (collectively, the Business\u201d). Under the Final CBA, the Company may only sell the Business to The Coca-Cola Company or third party buyers approved by The Coca-Cola Company. The Company annually can obtain a list of such approved third party buyers from The Coca-Cola Company or, upon receipt of a third party offer to purchase the Business, may seek approval of such buyer by The Coca-Cola Company. In addition, the Final CBA contains a sale process that would apply if the Company notifies The Coca-Cola Company that it wishes to sell the Business to The Coca-Cola Company.\nIn such event, if the Company and The Coca-Cola Company are unable in good faith to negotiate terms and conditions of a binding purchase and sale agreement, including the purchase price for the Business, then the Company may either withdraw from negotiations with The Coca-Cola Company or initiate a third-party valuation process described in the Final CBA to determine the purchase price for the Business. Upon such third party's determination of the purchase price, the Company may decide to continue with its potential sale of the Business to The Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company would then have the option to (i) purchase the Business for such purchase price pursuant to defined terms and conditions set forth in the Final CBA, including, to the extent not otherwise agreed by the Company and The Coca-Cola Company, default non-price terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement, or (ii) elect not to purchase the Business, in which case the Final CBA would automatically be amended to, among other things, permit the Company to sell the Business to any third party without obtaining The Coca-Cola Company's prior approval of such third party.\nThe Final CBA also includes terms that would apply in the event The Coca-Cola Company terminates the Final CBA following the Company's default thereunder. These terms include a requirement that The Coca-Cola Company acquire the Business upon such termination as well as the purchase price payable to the Company in such sale. The Final CBA specifies that the purchase price would be determined in accordance with a third-party valuation process equivalent to that employed if the Company notifies The Coca-Cola Company that it desires to sell the Business to The Coca-Cola Company; provided, the purchase price would be 85%\nof the valuation of the Business determined in the third-party valuation process if the Final CBA is terminated as a result of the Company's willful misconduct in violating certain obligations in the Final CBA with respect to dealing in other beverage products and other business activities, if a change in control occurs without the consent of The Coca-Cola Company or if the Company disposes of a majority of the voting power of any subsidiary of the Company that is a party to an agreement regarding the distribution or sale of Covered Beverages or Related Products.\nUnder the Final CBA, the Company will be required to ensure it achieves an equivalent case volume per capita change rate that is not less than one standard deviation below the median of such rates for all U.S. Coca-Cola bottlers. If the Company fails to comply with the equivalent case volume per capita change rate obligation for two consecutive years, it would have a twelve-month cure period to achieve an equivalent case volume per capita change rate within such standard before it would be considered in breach under the Final CBA and the previously described termination provisions are triggered. The Final CBA also requires the Company to make minimum, ongoing capital expenditures at a specified level.\nSale of BYB Brands, Inc.\nOn August 24, 2015, the Company sold BYB Brands, Inc. ( BYB\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company to The Coca-Cola Company. Pursuant to the stock purchase agreement dated July 22, 2015, the Company sold all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of BYB for a cash purchase price of $26.4 million.

Revenue management has been and continues to be a key driver which has a significant impact on the Company's results of operations.\nProduct Innovation and Beverage Portfolio Expansion: Innovation of both new brands and packages has been and is expected to continue to be important to the Company's overall revenue. Recent product introductions from the Company and The Coca-Cola Company include new flavor varieties within certain brands such as Fanta Sparkling Fruit, Minute Maid Refreshment, Monster, Dasani Drops, NOS, and Dasani Sparkling. New packaging introductions over the last several years include the 253 ml bottle, the 1.25-liter bottle, the 7.5-ounce sleek can, the 2-liter contour bottle for Coca-Cola products, and the 16-ounce bottle/24-ounce bottle package.\nDistribution Cost Management: Distribution costs represent the costs of transporting finished goods from Company locations to customer outlets. Total distribution costs amounted to $314.3 million, $222.9 million and $211.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Management of these costs will continue to be a key area of emphasis for the Company.\nThe Company has three primary delivery systems:\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> bulk delivery for large supermarkets, mass merchandisers and club stores;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> advanced sale delivery for convenience stores, drug stores, small supermarkets and on-premises accounts; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> full service delivery for its full service vending customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProductivity: A key driver in the Company's selling, delivery and administrative ( S,D&A\u201d) expense management relates to ongoing improvements in labor productivity and asset productivity.\nItems Impacting Operations and Financial Condition\nThe comparison of operating results for 2015 to the operating results for 2016 and 2014 are affected by the impact of one additional selling week in 2015 due to the Company's fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to December 31st. The estimated net sales, gross profit and S,D&A expenses for the additional selling week in 2015 of approximately $39 million, $14 million and $10 million, respectively, are included in reported results in 2015.\nThe following items also affect the comparability of the financial results presented below:\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $1.06 billion in net sales and $24.3 million of operating income related to the Expansion Territories and Regional Manufacturing Facilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $32.3 million of expenses related to acquiring and transitioning Expansion Territories and Regional Manufacturing Facilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $4.7 million pretax favorable mark-to-market adjustments related to our commodity hedging program\u037e\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $4.0 million of additional expense related to increased charitable contributions;

The Company includes a portion of these costs in S,D&A expenses.\nS,D&A Expenses\nS,D&A expenses include the following: sales management labor costs, distribution costs from sales distribution centers to customer locations, sales distribution center warehouse costs, depreciation expense related to sales centers, delivery vehicles and cold drink equipment, point-of-sale expenses, advertising expenses, cold drink equipment repair costs, amortization of intangibles and administrative support labor and operating costs.\nS,D&A expenses increased by $285.0 million, or 35.5%, to $1.09 billion in 2016, as compared to $802.9 million in 2015. S,D&A expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 34.5% in 2016 from 34.8% in 2015. The increase in S,D&A expenses was principally attributable to the following (in millions):\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Attributable to:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 141.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in employee salaries including bonus and incentives due to additional personnel added from the Expansion Territories and normal salary increases\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment primarily due to depreciation for fleet and vending equipment in the Expansion Territories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in employee benefit costs primarily due to additional medical expense and increased 401(k) employer matching contributions for employees in the Expansion Territories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in expenses related to the Expansion Territories, primarily professional fees related to due diligence\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in marketing expense primarily due to increased spending for promotional items and media and cold drink sponsorships\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in employer payroll taxes primarily due to payroll in the Expansion Territories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in property and casualty insurance expense primarily due to an increase in insurance premiums and insurance claims from the addition of the Expansion Territories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in vending and fountain parts expense due to the addition of the Expansion Territories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in software expenses primarily due to investment in technology for the Expansion Territories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in property, vehicle and other taxes due to the addition of the Expansion Territories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in rental expense due primarily to additional equipment and facilities rent expense for the Expansion Territories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in facilities non-rent expenses related to new facilities added in the Expansion Territories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in charitable contributions made during the first quarter of 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other individually immaterial expense increases primarily related to the Expansion Territories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other individually immaterial increases\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 285.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total increase in S,D&A expenses\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nShipping and handling costs related to the movement of finished goods from manufacturing locations to sales distribution centers are included in cost of sales. Shipping and handling costs related to the movement of finished goods from sales distribution centers to customer locations are included in S,D&A expenses and totaled $314.3 million in 2016 and $222.9 million in 2015.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net, increased $7.4 million, or 25.6%, to $36.3 million in 2016, as compared to $28.9 million in 2015. The increase was primarily a result of additional borrowings to finance the territory expansion.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, included noncash income of $1.9 million in 2016 and a noncash expense of $3.6 million in 2015 as a result of fair value adjustments of the Company's contingent consideration liability related to the Expansion Territories. The adjustment was primarily a result of a change in the risk-free interest rates. As the contingent consideration is calculated using 40 years of discounted cash flows, any reductions in contingent consideration due to current payments of the liability are effectively marked to market at the next reporting period, assuming interest rates and future projections remain constant.\nEach reporting period, the Company adjusts its contingent consideration liability related to the newly-acquired distribution territories to fair value. The fair value is determined by discounting future expected sub-bottling payments required under the CBAs using the Company's estimated weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d), which is impacted by many factors, including the risk-free interest rate. These future expected sub-bottling payments extend through the life of the related distribution asset acquired in each distribution territory expansion, which is generally 40 years. In addition, the Company is required to pay quarterly the current portion of the sub-bottling fee. As a result, the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration liability is impacted by the Company's estimated WACC, management's best estimate of the amounts of sub-bottling payments that will be paid in the future under the CBAs, and current period sub-bottling payments made. Changes in any of these factors, particularly the underlying risk-free interest rate used to estimate the Company's WACC, could materially impact the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration and consequently the amount of noncash expense (or income) recorded each reporting period.\nGain (Loss) on Exchange of Franchise Territory\nDuring 2015, the Company and CCR completed a like-kind exchange transaction where CCR agreed to exchange certain assets of CCR relating to the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of Coca-Cola and other beverage products in the territory served by CCR's facilities and equipment located in Lexington, Kentucky in exchange for certain assets of the Company relating to the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of Coca-Cola and other beverage products in the territory served by the Company's facilities and equipment located in Jackson, Tennessee. The fair value in 2015 of the Lexington net assets acquired totaled $36.8 million and the Company paid cash of approximately $10.5 million. The carrying value of the Jackson net assets was $17.5 million, resulting in a net gain of $8.8 million. The balances of net assets acquired and cash paid were subsequently adjusted in 2016 as a result of final post-closing adjustments. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nGain on Sale of Business\nDuring 2015, the Company sold BYB, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to The Coca-Cola Company. The Company received cash proceeds of $26.4 million. The net assets of BYB at closing totaled $3.7 million, which resulted in a gain of $22.7 million in 2015.\nBargain Purchase Gain, Net of Tax\nIn addition to the acquired Expansion Territories, the Company also acquired a make-ready center\u201d in Annapolis, Maryland from CCR for approximately $5.3 million in 2015. The cash paid was subsequently adjusted in 2016 as a result of final post-closing adjustments. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The fair value of the net assets acquired totaled $7.3 million, which resulted in a bargain purchase gain of approximately $2.0 million, net of tax of approximately $1.3 million, recorded in 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company's effective tax rate, calculated by dividing income tax expense by income before income taxes, was 38.9% for 2016 and 34.4% for 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate was driven primarily by a decrease to the favorable manufacturing deduction, as a percentage of pre-tax income, less of a decrease to the valuation allowance in 2016 as compared to 2015, and an increase in non-deductible travel expense. The Company's effective tax rate, calculated by dividing income tax expense by income before income taxes minus net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, was 41.8% for 2016 and 36.6% for 2015.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nThe Company recorded net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $6.5 million in 2016 and $6.0 million in 2015 related to the portion of Piedmont owned by The Coca-Cola Company.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax\nOther comprehensive loss, net of tax, was $10.5 million in 2016 and was primarily a result of actuarial losses on the Company's pension and postretirement benefit plans.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nA summary of the Company's financial results for 2015 and 2014 follows:\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,306,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,746,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 560,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,405,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,041,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 364,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 901,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 705,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 195,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> S,D&A expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 802,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 619,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 183,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (357\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,576\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,077\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,499\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 232.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on exchange of franchise territory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bargain purchase gain, net of tax of $1,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to Coca-Cola Bottling Co.

In 2015, the Company increased the contribution rates to the Teamsters Plan, with additional increases occurring annually, as part of a rehabilitation plan. This is a result of the Teamsters Plan being certified by its actuary as being in critical\u201d status for the plan year beginning January 1, 2013, which was incorporated into the renewal of collective bargaining agreements with the unions, effective April 28, 2014, and adopted by the Company as a rehabilitation plan, effective January 1, 2015.\nIf the Company chooses to stop participating in the Teamsters Plan, the Company could be required to pay the Teamsters Plan a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the Teamsters Plan. The Company does not anticipate withdrawing from the Teamsters Plan.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net, decreased $0.4 million, or 1.2%, to $28.9 million in 2015, as compared to $29.3 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in the Company's overall weighted average interest rate on its debt and capital lease obligations to 4.7% during 2015 from 5.7% during 2014.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, included a noncash expense of $3.6 million in 2015 and a noncash expense of $1.1 million in 2014 as a result of an unfavorable fair value adjustment of the Company's contingent consideration liability related to the Expansion Territories. The adjustment was primarily driven by current payments of sub-bottler fees in 2015. As the contingent consideration is calculated using 40 years of discounted cash flows, any reductions in contingent consideration due to current payments of the liability are effectively marked to market at the next reporting period, assuming interest rates and future projections remain constant.\nGain (Loss) on Exchange of Franchise Territory\nDuring 2015, the Company and CCR completed a like-kind exchange transaction where CCR agreed to exchange certain assets of CCR relating to the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of Coca-Cola and other beverage products in the territory served by CCR's facilities and equipment located in Lexington, Kentucky in exchange for certain assets of the Company relating to the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of Coca-Cola and other beverage products in the territory served by the Company's facilities and equipment located in Jackson, Tennessee. The fair value in 2015 of the Lexington net assets acquired totaled $36.8 million and the Company paid cash of approximately $10.5 million. The carrying value of the Jackson net assets was $17.5 million, resulting in a net gain of $8.8 million. The balances of net assets acquired and cash paid were subsequently adjusted in 2016 as a result of final post-closing adjustments. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nGain on Sale of Business\nDuring 2015, the Company sold BYB, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to The Coca-Cola Company. The Company received cash proceeds of $26.4 million. The net assets of BYB at closing totaled $3.7 million, which resulted in a gain of $22.7 million in 2015.\nBargain Purchase Gain, Net of Tax\nIn addition to the acquired Expansion Territories, the Company also acquired a make-ready center\u201d in Annapolis, Maryland from CCR for approximately $5.3 million in 2015. The cash paid was subsequently adjusted in 2016 as a result of final post-closing adjustments. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The fair value of the net assets acquired totaled $7.3 million, which resulted in a bargain purchase gain of approximately $2.0 million, net of tax of approximately $1.3 million, recorded in 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company's effective tax rate, calculated by dividing income tax expense by income before income taxes, was 34.4% for 2015 and 35.1% for 2014. The decrease in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from a state tax legislation target that was met that caused a reduction to the corporate tax rate in 2015 and reductions to the valuation allowance due to the Company's assessment of the Company's ability to use certain loss carryforwards primarily related to the sale of BYB. The Company's effective tax rate, as calculated by dividing income tax expense by income before income taxes less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, was 36.6% for 2015 and 38.4% for 2014.\nThe Company decreased its valuation allowance by $1.3 million for 2015 and increased its valuation allowance by $1.2 million for 2014. The effect for both years was primarily due to the Company's assessment of its ability to use certain loss carryforwards. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nThe Company recorded net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $6.0 million in 2015 and $4.7 million in 2014 related to the portion of Piedmont owned by The Coca-Cola Company.\nOther Comprehensive Income, Net of Tax\nOther comprehensive income, net of tax, was $7.5 million in 2015 and was primarily a result of actuarial gains on the Company's pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nSegment Operating Results\nThe Company evaluates segment reporting in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting each reporting period, including evaluating the reporting package reviewed by the Chief Operation Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d). The Company has concluded the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as a group, represent the CODM.\nThe Company believes four operating segments exist. Nonalcoholic Beverages represents the vast majority of the Company's consolidated revenues, operating income, and assets. The remaining three operating segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate reporting, either individually or in the aggregate, and therefore have been combined into an All Other\u201d reportable segment.\nPrior to the sale of BYB in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company believed five operating segments existed. Subsequent to this sale, two operating segments, Franchised Nonalcoholic Beverages and Internally-Developed Nonalcoholic Beverages (made up entirely of BYB), were aggregated due to their similar economic characteristics as well as the similarity of products, production processes, types of customers, methods of distribution, and nature of the regulatory environment. This combined segment is Nonalcoholic Beverages.\nThe Company's results for its two reportable segments are as follows:\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonalcoholic Beverages\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,060,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,245,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,710,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 234,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 160,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Eliminations*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (139,241\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (99,569\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (86,865\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,156,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,306,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,746,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonalcoholic Beverages\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 123,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 92,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 82,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 127,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 98,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparable / Adjusted Results\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). However, management believes certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing the Company's ongoing performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting.\nThe following tables reconcile reported GAAP results to comparable results (non-GAAP) for 2016 and

In addition, the Company had additions to property, plant and equipment of $172.6 million during 2016, which excludes $227.1 million in property, plant and equipment acquired in the Expansion Transactions completed in 2016.\nNet working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, increased $27.5 million to $135.9 million at January 1, 2017, from $108.4 million at January 3, 2016.\nSignificant changes in net working capital on January 1, 2017 from January 3, 2016 were as follows:\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> A decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $33.6 million primarily due to acquisitions of Expansion Territories and Regional Manufacturing Facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> An increase in accounts receivables, trade of $85.5 million primarily due to accounts receivables from sales in newly acquired territories in 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> An increase in accounts receivable from The Coca-Cola Company of $39.0 million and an increase in accounts payable to The Coca-Cola Company of $56.1 million, primarily as a result of activity from newly acquired territories in 2016 and the timing of payments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> An increase in inventories of $54.1 million primarily as a result of inventories acquired from the Expansion Transactions in 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> An increase in accounts payable, trade of $33.9 million primarily as a result of the Expansion Transactions in 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> An increase in other accrued liabilities of $29.7 million primarily as a result of the timing of payments and an increase in the current portion of acquisition related contingent consideration.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> An increase in accrued compensation of $11.0 million primarily as a result of increased incentive compensations accruals resulting from the Company's financial performance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital Resources\nThe Company's sources of capital include cash flows from operations, available credit facilities and the issuance of debt and equity securities. The Company has obtained the majority of its long-term debt, other than capital leases, from public markets and bank facilities. Management believes the Company has sufficient sources of capital available to refinance its maturing debt, finance its business plan, including the proposed acquisition of previously announced additional Expansion Territories and Regional Manufacturing Facilities, meet its working capital requirements and maintain an appropriate level of capital spending for at least the next 12 months. The amount and frequency of future dividends will be determined by the Company's Board of Directors in light of the earnings and financial condition of the Company at such time, and no assurance can be given that dividends will be declared or paid in the future.\nIn October 2014, the Company entered into a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), and in April 2015, the Company exercised an accordion feature which established a $450 million aggregate maximum borrowing capacity on the Revolving Credit Facility. The $450 million borrowing capacity includes up to $50 million available for the issuance of letters of credit. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a floating base rate or a floating Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin, dependent on the Company's credit rating at the time of borrowing. At the Company's current credit ratings, the Company must pay an annual facility fee of 0.15% of the lenders' aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility has a scheduled maturity date of October 16, 2019.\nThe Company currently believes all of the banks participating in the Company's Revolving Credit Facility have the ability to and will meet any funding requests from the Company. On January 1, 2017, the Company had $152.0 million of outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility. On January 3, 2016, the Company had no outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn June 2016, the Company entered into a five-year term loan agreement for a senior unsecured term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of $300 million, maturing June 7, 2021. The Company may request additional term loans under the agreement, provided the Company's aggregate borrowings under the Term Loan Facility do not exceed $500 million. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a floating base rate or a floating Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin, dependent on the Company's credit rating, at the Company's option. The Company used $210 million of the proceeds from the Term Loan Facility to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company then used the remaining proceeds, as well as borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, to repay the $164.8 million of Senior Notes that matured on June 15, 2016.\nBoth the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility include two financial covenants: a consolidated cash flow/fixed charges ratio and a consolidated funded indebtedness/cash flow ratio, each as defined in the respective agreements. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of January 1, 2017. These covenants do not currently, and the Company does not anticipate they will, restrict its liquidity or capital resources.\nAll outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the Company and none has been issued by any of its subsidiaries. There are no guarantees of the Company's debt.\nThe Company's credit ratings are reviewed periodically by the respective rating agencies. Changes in the Company's operating results or financial position could result in changes in the Company's credit ratings. Lower credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs for the Company or reduced access to capital markets, which could have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. There were no changes in these credit ratings from the prior year and the credit ratings are currently stable. As of January 1, 2017, the Company's credit ratings were as follows:\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Long-Term Debt\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standard & Poor's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> BBB\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Moody's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Baa2\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe indentures under which the Company's public debt was issued do not include financial covenants but do limit the incurrence of certain liens and encumbrances as well as indebtedness by the Company's subsidiaries in excess of certain amounts.\nNet debt and capital lease obligations were summarized as follows:\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 907,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 619,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt and capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 955,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 675,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net debt and capital lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 934,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 619,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The non-GAAP measure Total net debt and capital lease obligations\u201d is used to provide investors with additional information which management believes is helpful in the evaluation of the Company's capital structure and financial leverage.

Piedmont is the Company's only subsidiary that has a significant noncontrolling interest. Piedmont distributes and markets nonalcoholic beverages in portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. The Company provides a portion of the nonalcoholic beverage products to Piedmont at cost and receives a fee for managing the operations of Piedmont pursuant to a management agreement. Noncontrolling interest consists of The Coca-Cola Company's interest in Piedmont, which was 22.7% for all periods presented.\nExpansion Transactions with The Coca-Cola Company\nAs part of The Coca-Cola Company's plans to refranchise its North American bottling territories, the Company has engaged in a multi-year series of transactions since April 2013 with The Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. ( CCR\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company, to significantly expand the Company's distribution and manufacturing operations. This expansion includes acquisition of rights to serve additional distribution territories previously served by CCR (the Expansion Territories\u201d) and of related distribution assets (the Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions\u201d), as well as the acquisition of regional manufacturing facilities ( Regional Manufacturing Facilities\u201d) and related manufacturing assets previously owned by CCR (the Manufacturing Facility Expansion Transactions\u201d and, together with the Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions, the Expansion Transactions\u201d).\nDistribution Territory Expansion Transactions\nIn April 2013, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent with The Coca-Cola Company to acquire Expansion Territories in parts of Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana, all of which were acquired by the second quarter of 2015.\nIn May 2015, the Company completed an exchange transaction with CCR through which the Company acquired certain assets and rights for territory in Lexington, Kentucky from CCR and transferred certain assets and rights for territory in Jackson, Tennessee to CCR. The assets exchanged relate to the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of Coca-Cola and other beverage products in each territory, including the rights to produce such beverages in each territory included in the exchange.\nIn May 2015, the Company also entered into a second non-binding letter of intent (the May 2015 LOI\u201d) with The Coca-Cola Company to acquire Expansion Territories in Baltimore, Maryland; Alexandria, Norfolk and Richmond, Virginia; the District of Columbia; Cincinnati, Columbus and Dayton, Ohio; and Indianapolis, Indiana. Pursuant to the May 2015 LOI, CCR would:\n (i) Grant the Company in two phases certain exclusive rights for the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of The Coca-Cola Company-owned and licensed products in additional territories served by CCR; and \n (ii) Sell the Company certain assets that included rights to distribute those cross-licensed brands distributed in the territories by CCR as well as the assets used by CCR in the distribution of the cross-licensed brands and The Coca-Cola Company brands. \nThe first phase of the additional Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions contemplated by the May 2015 LOI was agreed upon in an asset purchase agreement entered into by the Company and CCR in September 2015 (the September 2015 APA\u201d). The September 2015 APA included Expansion Territory in: (i) eastern and northern Virginia, (ii) the entire state of Maryland, (iii) the District of Columbia, and (iv) parts of Delaware, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and was completed by the second quarter of 2016. Following is a summary of key closing dates for the transactions covered by the September 2015 APA:\n \u2022 October 30, 2015 - The first closing under the September 2015 APA occurred for territories served by distribution facilities in Norfolk, Fredericksburg and Staunton, Virginia and Elizabeth City, North Carolina. \n \u2022 January 29, 2016 - The second closing under the September 2015 APA occurred for territories served by distribution facilities in Easton and Salisbury, Maryland and Richmond and Yorktown, Virginia. \n \u2022 April 1, 2016 - The third closing under the September 2015 APA occurred for territories served by distribution facilities in Capitol Heights and La Plata, Maryland and Alexandria, Virginia. \n \u2022 April 29, 2016 - The final closing under the September 2015 APA occurred for territories served by distribution facilities in Baltimore, Cumberland and Hagerstown, Maryland. \nOn September 1, 2016, the Company and CCR entered into an asset purchase agreement (the September 2016 Distribution APA\u201d) for the second phase of the additional distribution territory contemplated by the May 2015 LOI and for a portion of the additional distribution territory contemplated by the CCR June 2016 LOI, including territories located in (i) central and southern Ohio, (ii) northern Kentucky, (iii) large portions of Indiana and (iv) parts of Illinois and West Virginia that are currently served by CCR.

As a result of subsequent discussions with The Coca-Cola Company, in September 2015, the Company and The Coca-Cola Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent (the September 2016 LOI\u201d) pursuant to which CCR would sell six Regional Manufacturing Facilities and related manufacturing assets (collectively, the Manufacturing Assets\u201d) to the Company as the Company becomes a regional producing bottler ( Regional Producing Bottler\u201d) in the national product supply system. Similar to, and as an integral part of, the Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions described in the May 2015 LOI, the sale of the Manufacturing Assets by CCR to the Company would be accomplished in two phases: (i) the first phase would include three Regional Manufacturing Facilities located in Sandston, Virginia; Silver Spring, Maryland; and Baltimore, Maryland and (ii) the second phase would include three Regional Manufacturing Facilities located in Indianapolis, Indiana; Portland Indiana; and Cincinnati, Ohio.\nOn October 30, 2015, the Company and CCR entered into an asset purchase agreement (the October 2015 APA\u201d) for the first phase of the Regional Manufacturing Facilities acquisitions contemplated by the September 2015 LOI, including Regional Manufacturing Facilities located in Sandston, Virginia; Silver Spring, Maryland; and Baltimore, Maryland, and was completed by the second quarter of 2016.

On October 28, 2016, the first closing under the September 2016 Manufacturing APA occurred for the Regional Manufacturing Facility in Cincinnati, Ohio.\nThe rights for the manufacture, production and packaging of specified beverages at the Regional Manufacturing Facilities acquired by the Company have been granted by The Coca-Cola Company to the Company pursuant to an initial regional manufacturing agreement in the form disclosed in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 5, 2016 (the Initial RMA\u201d). Pursuant to its terms, the Initial RMA will be amended, restated and converted into a final form of regional manufacturing agreement (the Final RMA\u201d) concurrent with the conversion of the Company's Bottling Agreements (as defined below) to the Final CBA as described in the description of the Territory Conversion Agreement (defined and described below).\nUnder the Final RMA, the Company's aggregate business directly and primarily related to the manufacture of Authorized Covered Beverages, permitted cross-licensed brands and other beverages and beverage products for The Coca-Cola Company will be subject to the same agreed upon sale process provisions included in the Final CBA as described below, which include the need to obtain The Coca-Cola Company's prior approval of a potential purchaser of such manufacturing business. The Coca-Cola Company will also have the right to terminate the Final RMA in the event of an uncured default by the Company.\nAnnapolis Make-Ready Center Acquisition\nAs a part of the Expansion Transactions, on October 30, 2015, the Company acquired from CCR a make-ready center\u201d in Annapolis, Maryland for a cash purchase price of $5.4 million, which includes all post-closing adjustments. The Company recorded a bargain purchase gain of approximately $2.0 million on this transaction after applying a deferred tax liability of approximately $1.3 million. The Company uses the make-ready center to deploy and refurbish vending and other sales equipment for use in the marketplace.\nThe net cash purchase price for each of the Expansion Transactions, which includes both Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions and Manufacturing Facility Expansion Transactions, completed as of January 1, 2017, is as follows:\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> Territory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Acquisition / Exchange Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Cash\nPurchase Price\n(In Millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Johnson City and Morristown, Tennessee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> May 23, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Knoxville, Tennessee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 24, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cleveland and Cookeville, Tennessee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Louisville, Kentucky and Evansville, Indiana\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 27, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Paducah and Pikeville, Kentucky\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> May 1, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lexington, Kentucky for Jackson, Tennessee Exchange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> May 1, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Norfolk, Fredericksburg and Staunton, Virginia and Elizabeth City, North Carolina\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Annapolis, Maryland Make-Ready Center\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Easton and Salisbury, Maryland, Richmond and Yorktown, Virginia, and Sandston, Virginia Regional Manufacturing Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 29, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Alexandria, Virginia and Capitol Heights and La Plata, Maryland\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Baltimore, Hagerstown and Cumberland, Maryland, and Silver Spring and Baltimore, Maryland Regional Manufacturing Facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 29, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cincinnati, Dayton, Lima and Portsmouth, Ohio and Louisa, Kentucky and Cincinnati, Ohio Regional Manufacturing Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 28, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n * NOTE: The cash purchase price amounts are subject to a final post-closing adjustment and, as a result, may either increase or decrease. \nThe financial results of the Expansion Transactions, Expansion Territories and Lexington Expansion Territory have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition or exchange dates.

The exchange includes rights to the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of The Coca-Cola Company-owned and -licensed products and certain cross-licensed brands in each territory and related Manufacturing Assets. \nIn June 2016, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Coca-Cola Bottling Company United, Inc. ( United\u201d), an independent bottler that is unrelated to the Company (the United June 2016 LOI\u201d).

The Company is continuing to work towards a definitive agreement or agreements with The Coca-Cola Company and CCR for the remaining proposed Expansion Transactions described in the February 2016 LOI and the CCR June 2016 LOI. The Company is also continuing to work towards a definitive agreement or agreements with United for the proposed transactions described in the United June 2016 LOI.\nNational Product Supply Governance Agreement (the NPSG Governance Agreement\u201d)\nIn October 2015, the Company, The Coca-Cola Company and three other Coca-Cola bottlers, including CCR, who are considered Regional Producing Bottlers\u201d ( RPBs\u201d) in The Coca-Cola Company's national product supply system, entered into the NPSG Governance Agreement. Pursuant to the NPSG Governance Agreement, The Coca-Cola Company and the RPBs have formed a national product supply group (the NPSG\u201d) and agreed to certain binding governance mechanisms, including a governing board (the NPSG Board\u201d) comprised of a representative of (i) the Company, (ii) The Coca-Cola Company and (iii) each other Regional Producing Bottler. As The Coca-Cola Company continues its multi-year refranchising effort of its North American bottling territories, additional Regional Producing Bottlers may be added to the NPSG Board. As of January 2017, the NPSG Board consisted of The Coca-Cola-Company, the Company and five other RPBs, including CCR.\nThe stated objectives of the NPSG include, among others, (i) Coca-Cola system strategic infrastructure investment and divestment planning; (ii) network optimization of all plant to distribution center sourcing; and (iii) new product/packaging infrastructure planning.\nThe NPSG Board makes and/or oversees and directs certain key decisions regarding the NPSG, including decisions regarding the management and staffing of the NPSG and the funding for the ongoing operations of the NPSG. The Company is obligated to pay a certain portion of the costs of operating the NPSG. Pursuant to the decisions of the NPSG Board made from time to time and subject to the terms and conditions of the NPSG Governance Agreement, the Company and each other Regional Producing Bottler will make investments in their respective manufacturing assets and will implement Coca-Cola system strategic investment opportunities that are consistent with the NPSG Governance Agreement.\nTerritory Conversion Agreement\nConcurrent with their execution of the September 2015 APA, the Company, CCR and The Coca-Cola Company executed a territory conversion agreement (as amended February 8, 2016, the Territory Conversion Agreement\u201d), which provides that, subject to certain exceptions, all of the Company's master bottle contracts, allied bottle contracts, Initial CBAs and other bottling agreements with The Coca-Cola Company or CCR that authorize the Company to produce and/or distribute the Covered Beverages or Related Products, as defined therein, (collectively, the Bottling Agreements\u201d) would be amended, restated and converted, upon the occurrence of certain events described below, to a new and final comprehensive beverage agreement (the Final CBA\u201d).\nThe conversion would include all of the Company's then existing Bottling Agreements in the Expansion Territories and all other territories in the United States where the Company has rights to market, promote, distribute and sell beverage products owned or licensed by The Coca-Cola Company (the Legacy Territories\u201d), but would not affect any Bottling Agreements with respect to the greater Lexington, Kentucky territory. At the time of the conversion of the Bottling Agreements for the Legacy Territories to the Final CBA, CCR will pay a fee to the Company in cash, or another mutually agreed form of payment or credit, in an amount equivalent to 0.5 times the EBITDA the Company generates from sales in the Legacy Territories of Beverages (as defined in the Final CBA) either (i) owned by The Coca-Cola Company or licensed to The Coca-Cola Company and sublicensed to the Company, or (ii) owned by or licensed to Monster Energy Company ( Monster\u201d) on which the Company pays, and The Coca-Cola Company receives, a facilitation fee.\nThe Company may elect to cause the conversion of the Bottling Agreements to the Final CBA to occur at any time by giving written notice to The Coca-Cola Company. As the transactions contemplated by the September 2015 APA have now been consummated, the conversion will occur automatically upon the earliest of (i) the consummation of all remaining transactions described in the September 2016 Distribution APA (the Subsequent Phase Territory Transactions\u201d), (ii) January 1, 2020, as long as The Coca-Cola Company has satisfied certain obligations described in the Territory Conversion Agreement regarding its intent to complete the Subsequent Phase Territory Transactions, or (iii) 30 days following the Company's (a) termination of good faith negotiations of the Subsequent Phase Territory Transactions on terms similar to the terms for the transactions completed under the September 2015 APA or (b) notification that it no longer wants to pursue the Subsequent Phase Territory Transactions.\nThe Final CBA is similar to the Initial CBA in many respects, but also includes certain modifications and several new business, operational and governance provisions. For example, the Final CBA contains provisions that apply in the event of a potential sale of the Company or its aggregate businesses directly and primarily related to the marketing, promotion, distribution, and sale of Covered Beverages and Related Products (collectively, the Business\u201d). Under the Final CBA, the Company may only sell the Business to The Coca-Cola Company or third party buyers approved by The Coca-Cola Company. The Company annually can obtain a list of such approved third party buyers from The Coca-Cola Company or, upon receipt of a third party offer to purchase the Business, may seek approval of such buyer by The Coca-Cola Company. In addition, the Final CBA contains a sale process that would apply if the Company notifies The Coca-Cola Company that it wishes to sell the Business to The Coca-Cola Company.\nIn such event, if the Company and The Coca-Cola Company are unable in good faith to negotiate terms and conditions of a binding purchase and sale agreement, including the purchase price for the Business, then the Company may either withdraw from negotiations with The Coca-Cola Company or initiate a third-party valuation process described in the Final CBA to determine the purchase price for the Business. Upon such third party's determination of the purchase price, the Company may decide to continue with its potential sale of the Business to The Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company would then have the option to (i) purchase the Business for such purchase price pursuant to defined terms and conditions set forth in the Final CBA, including, to the extent not otherwise agreed by the Company and The Coca-Cola Company, default non-price terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement, or (ii) elect not to purchase the Business, in which case the Final CBA would automatically be amended to, among other things, permit the Company to sell the Business to any third party without obtaining The Coca-Cola Company's prior approval of such third party.\nThe Final CBA also includes terms that would apply in the event The Coca-Cola Company terminates the Final CBA following the Company's default thereunder. These terms include a requirement that The Coca-Cola Company acquire the Business upon such termination as well as the purchase price payable to the Company in such sale. The Final CBA specifies that the purchase price would be determined in accordance with a third-party valuation process equivalent to that employed if the Company notifies The Coca-Cola Company that it desires to sell the Business to The Coca-Cola Company; provided, the purchase price would be 85%\nof the valuation of the Business determined in the third-party valuation process if the Final CBA is terminated as a result of the Company's willful misconduct in violating certain obligations in the Final CBA with respect to dealing in other beverage products and other business activities, if a change in control occurs without the consent of The Coca-Cola Company or if the Company disposes of a majority of the voting power of any subsidiary of the Company that is a party to an agreement regarding the distribution or sale of Covered Beverages or Related Products.\nUnder the Final CBA, the Company will be required to ensure it achieves an equivalent case volume per capita change rate that is not less than one standard deviation below the median of such rates for all U.S. Coca-Cola bottlers. If the Company fails to comply with the equivalent case volume per capita change rate obligation for two consecutive years, it would have a twelve-month cure period to achieve an equivalent case volume per capita change rate within such standard before it would be considered in breach under the Final CBA and the previously described termination provisions are triggered. The Final CBA also requires the Company to make minimum, ongoing capital expenditures at a specified level.\nSale of BYB Brands, Inc.\nOn August 24, 2015, the Company sold BYB Brands, Inc. ( BYB\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company to The Coca-Cola Company. Pursuant to the stock purchase agreement dated July 22, 2015, the Company sold all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of BYB for a cash purchase price of $26.4 million. As a result of the sale, the Company recognized a gain of $22.7 million, which was recorded to Gain on sale of business in the consolidated financial statements in 2015.

Total bottle/can sales remain unchanged in prior periods. \nAreas of Emphasis\nKey priorities for the Company include territory and manufacturing expansion, revenue management, product innovation and beverage portfolio expansion, distribution cost management, and productivity.\nRevenue Management: Revenue management requires a strategy that reflects consideration for pricing of brands and packages within product categories and channels, highly effective working relationships with customers and disciplined fact-based decision-making. Revenue management has been and continues to be a key driver which has a significant impact on the Company's results of operations.\nProduct Innovation and Beverage Portfolio Expansion: Innovation of both new brands and packages has been and is expected to continue to be important to the Company's overall revenue. Recent product introductions from the Company and The Coca-Cola Company include new flavor varieties within certain brands such as Fanta Sparkling Fruit, Minute Maid Refreshment, Monster, Dasani Drops, NOS, and Dasani Sparkling. New packaging introductions over the last several years include the 253 ml bottle, the 1.25-liter bottle, the 7.5-ounce sleek can, the 2-liter contour bottle for Coca-Cola products, and the 16-ounce bottle/24-ounce bottle package.\nDistribution Cost Management: Distribution costs represent the costs of transporting finished goods from Company locations to customer outlets. Total distribution costs amounted to $314.3 million, $222.9 million and $211.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Management of these costs will continue to be a key area of emphasis for the Company.\nThe Company has three primary delivery systems:\n \u2022 bulk delivery for large supermarkets, mass merchandisers and club stores; \n \u2022 advanced sale delivery for convenience stores, drug stores, small supermarkets and on-premises accounts; and \n \u2022 full service delivery for its full service vending customers. \nProductivity: A key driver in the Company's selling, delivery and administrative ( S,D&A\u201d) expense management relates to ongoing improvements in labor productivity and asset productivity.\nItems Impacting Operations and Financial Condition\nThe comparison of operating results for 2015 to the operating results for 2016 and 2014 are affected by the impact of one additional selling week in 2015 due to the Company's fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to December 31st. The estimated net sales, gross profit and S,D&A expenses for the additional selling week in 2015 of approximately $39 million, $14 million and $10 million, respectively, are included in reported results in 2015.\nThe following items also affect the comparability of the financial results presented below:\n \u2022 $1.06 billion in net sales and $24.3 million of operating income related to the Expansion Territories and Regional Manufacturing Facilities;

These fees are used to offset a portion of the Company's delivery and handling costs.\nThe following table summarizes the percentage of the Company's total bottle/can volume and the percentage of the Company's total net sales, which are all included in the Nonalcoholic Beverages operating segment, attributed to its largest customers:\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Approximate percent of the Company's total Bottle/can volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Approximate percent of the Company's total Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food Lion, LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Approximate percent of the Company's total Bottle/can volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Approximate percent of the Company's total Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> The Kroger Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Approximate percent of the Company's total Bottle/can volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Approximate percent of the Company's total Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales includes the following: raw material costs, manufacturing labor, manufacturing overhead including depreciation expense, manufacturing warehousing costs, shipping and handling costs related to the movement of finished goods from manufacturing locations to sales distribution centers and purchase of finished goods.\nCost of sales increased $535.3 million, or 38.1%, to $1.94 billion in 2016, as compared to $1.41 billion in 2015. The increase in cost of sales was principally attributable to the following (in millions):\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Attributable to:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 493.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net sales increase related to the 2016 Expansion Territories, partially offset by the 2015 comparable sales of Legacy Territories exchanged for Expansion Territories in 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3% increase in bottle/can sales volume to retail customers in the Legacy Territories, primarily due to an increase in still beverages\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in raw material costs and increased purchases of finished products\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in external transportation cost of sales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (13.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in marketing funding support received for the Legacy Territories, primarily from The Coca-Cola Company\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (11.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease in cost of sales of the Company's own brand products, primarily due to the sale of BYB in the third quarter of 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in cost due to the Company's commodity hedging program\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 535.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total increase in cost of sales\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following inputs represent a substantial portion of the Company's total cost of sales: (i) sweeteners, (ii) packaging materials, including plastic bottles and aluminum cans, and (iii) finished products purchased from other vendors.\nThe Company relies extensively on advertising and sales promotion in the marketing of its products. The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies that supply concentrates, syrups and finished products to the Company make substantial marketing and advertising expenditures to promote sales in the local territories served by the Company. The Company also benefits from national advertising programs conducted by The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies. Certain of the marketing expenditures by The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies are made pursuant to annual arrangements. Total marketing funding support from The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies, which includes direct payments to the Company and payments to customers for marketing programs, was $99.4 million in 2016, as compared to $72.2 million in 2015.\nThe Company's cost of sales may not be comparable to other peer companies, as some include all costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales. The Company includes a portion of these costs in S,D&A expenses.\nS,D&A Expenses\nS,D&A expenses include the following: sales management labor costs, distribution costs from sales distribution centers to customer locations, sales distribution center warehouse costs, depreciation expense related to sales centers, delivery vehicles and cold drink equipment, point-of-sale expenses, advertising expenses, cold drink equipment repair costs, amortization of intangibles and administrative support labor and operating costs.\nS,D&A expenses increased by $285.0 million, or 35.5%, to $1.09 billion in 2016, as compared to $802.9 million in 2015. S,D&A expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 34.5% in 2016 from 34.8% in 2015. The increase in S,D&A expenses was principally attributable to the following (in millions):\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Attributable to:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 141.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in employee salaries including bonus and incentives due to additional personnel added from the Expansion Territories and normal salary increases\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment primarily due to depreciation for fleet and vending equipment in the Expansion Territories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in employee benefit costs primarily due to additional medical expense and increased 401(k) employer matching contributions for employees in the Expansion Territories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in expenses related to the Expansion Territories, primarily professional fees related to due diligence\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in marketing expense primarily due to increased spending for promotional items and media and cold drink sponsorships\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in employer payroll taxes primarily due to payroll in the Expansion Territories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in property and casualty insurance expense primarily due to an increase in insurance premiums and insurance claims from the addition of the Expansion Territories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in vending and fountain parts expense due to the addition of the Expansion Territories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in software expenses primarily due to investment in technology for the Expansion Territories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in property, vehicle and other taxes due to the addition of the Expansion Territories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in rental expense due primarily to additional equipment and facilities rent expense for the Expansion Territories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in facilities non-rent expenses related to new facilities added in the Expansion Territories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in charitable contributions made during the first quarter of 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other individually immaterial expense increases primarily related to the Expansion Territories\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other individually immaterial increases\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $\n</td> <td> 285.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total increase in S,D&A expenses\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nShipping and handling costs related to the movement of finished goods from manufacturing locations to sales distribution centers are included in cost of sales. Shipping and handling costs related to the movement of finished goods from sales distribution centers to customer locations are included in S,D&A expenses and totaled $314.3 million in 2016 and $222.9 million in 2015.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net, increased $7.4 million, or 25.6%, to $36.3 million in 2016, as compared to $28.9 million in 2015. The increase was primarily a result of additional borrowings to finance the territory expansion.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, included noncash income of $1.9 million in 2016 and a noncash expense of $3.6 million in 2015 as a result of fair value adjustments of the Company's contingent consideration liability related to the Expansion Territories. The adjustment was primarily a result of a change in the risk-free interest rates. As the contingent consideration is calculated using 40 years of discounted cash flows, any reductions in contingent consideration due to current payments of the liability are effectively marked to market at the next reporting period, assuming interest rates and future projections remain constant.\nEach reporting period, the Company adjusts its contingent consideration liability related to the newly-acquired distribution territories to fair value. The fair value is determined by discounting future expected sub-bottling payments required under the CBAs using the Company's estimated weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d), which is impacted by many factors, including the risk-free interest rate. These future expected sub-bottling payments extend through the life of the related distribution asset acquired in each distribution territory expansion, which is generally 40 years. In addition, the Company is required to pay quarterly the current portion of the sub-bottling fee. As a result, the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration liability is impacted by the Company's estimated WACC, management's best estimate of the amounts of sub-bottling payments that will be paid in the future under the CBAs, and current period sub-bottling payments made. Changes in any of these factors, particularly the underlying risk-free interest rate used to estimate the Company's WACC, could materially impact the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration and consequently the amount of noncash expense (or income) recorded each reporting period.\nGain (Loss) on Exchange of Franchise Territory\nDuring 2015, the Company and CCR completed a like-kind exchange transaction where CCR agreed to exchange certain assets of CCR relating to the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of Coca-Cola and other beverage products in the territory served by CCR's facilities and equipment located in Lexington, Kentucky in exchange for certain assets of the Company relating to the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of Coca-Cola and other beverage products in the territory served by the Company's facilities and equipment located in Jackson, Tennessee. The fair value in 2015 of the Lexington net assets acquired totaled $36.8 million and the Company paid cash of approximately $10.5 million. The carrying value of the Jackson net assets was $17.5 million, resulting in a net gain of $8.8 million. The balances of net assets acquired and cash paid were subsequently adjusted in 2016 as a result of final post-closing adjustments. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nGain on Sale of Business\nDuring 2015, the Company sold BYB, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to The Coca-Cola Company. The Company received cash proceeds of $26.4 million. The net assets of BYB at closing totaled $3.7 million, which resulted in a gain of $22.7 million in 2015.\nBargain Purchase Gain, Net of Tax\nIn addition to the acquired Expansion Territories, the Company also acquired a make-ready center\u201d in Annapolis, Maryland from CCR for approximately $5.3 million in 2015. The cash paid was subsequently adjusted in 2016 as a result of final post-closing adjustments. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The fair value of the net assets acquired totaled $7.3 million, which resulted in a bargain purchase gain of approximately $2.0 million, net of tax of approximately $1.3 million, recorded in 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company's effective tax rate, calculated by dividing income tax expense by income before income taxes, was 38.9% for 2016 and 34.4% for 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate was driven primarily by a decrease to the favorable manufacturing deduction, as a percentage of pre-tax income, less of a decrease to the valuation allowance in 2016 as compared to 2015, and an increase in non-deductible travel expense. The Company's effective tax rate, calculated by dividing income tax expense by income before income taxes minus net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, was 41.8% for 2016 and 36.6% for 2015.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nThe Company recorded net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $6.5 million in 2016 and $6.0 million in 2015 related to the portion of Piedmont owned by The Coca-Cola Company.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax\nOther comprehensive loss, net of tax, was $10.5 million in 2016 and was primarily a result of actuarial losses on the Company's pension and postretirement benefit plans.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nA summary of the Company's financial results for 2015 and 2014 follows:\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,306,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,746,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 560,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,405,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,041,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 364,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 901,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 705,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 195,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> S,D&A expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 802,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 619,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 183,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (357\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,576\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,077\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,499\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 232.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on exchange of franchise territory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bargain purchase gain, net of tax of $1,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to Coca-Cola Bottling Co.

In 2015, the Company increased the contribution rates to the Teamsters Plan, with additional increases occurring annually, as part of a rehabilitation plan. This is a result of the Teamsters Plan being certified by its actuary as being in critical\u201d status for the plan year beginning January 1, 2013, which was incorporated into the renewal of collective bargaining agreements with the unions, effective April 28, 2014, and adopted by the Company as a rehabilitation plan, effective January 1, 2015.\nIf the Company chooses to stop participating in the Teamsters Plan, the Company could be required to pay the Teamsters Plan a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the Teamsters Plan. The Company does not anticipate withdrawing from the Teamsters Plan.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net, decreased $0.4 million, or 1.2%, to $28.9 million in 2015, as compared to $29.3 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in the Company's overall weighted average interest rate on its debt and capital lease obligations to 4.7% during 2015 from 5.7% during 2014.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, included a noncash expense of $3.6 million in 2015 and a noncash expense of $1.1 million in 2014 as a result of an unfavorable fair value adjustment of the Company's contingent consideration liability related to the Expansion Territories. The adjustment was primarily driven by current payments of sub-bottler fees in 2015. As the contingent consideration is calculated using 40 years of discounted cash flows, any reductions in contingent consideration due to current payments of the liability are effectively marked to market at the next reporting period, assuming interest rates and future projections remain constant.\nGain (Loss) on Exchange of Franchise Territory\nDuring 2015, the Company and CCR completed a like-kind exchange transaction where CCR agreed to exchange certain assets of CCR relating to the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of Coca-Cola and other beverage products in the territory served by CCR's facilities and equipment located in Lexington, Kentucky in exchange for certain assets of the Company relating to the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of Coca-Cola and other beverage products in the territory served by the Company's facilities and equipment located in Jackson, Tennessee. The fair value in 2015 of the Lexington net assets acquired totaled $36.8 million and the Company paid cash of approximately $10.5 million. The carrying value of the Jackson net assets was $17.5 million, resulting in a net gain of $8.8 million. The balances of net assets acquired and cash paid were subsequently adjusted in 2016 as a result of final post-closing adjustments. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nGain on Sale of Business\nDuring 2015, the Company sold BYB, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to The Coca-Cola Company. The Company received cash proceeds of $26.4 million. The net assets of BYB at closing totaled $3.7 million, which resulted in a gain of $22.7 million in 2015.\nBargain Purchase Gain, Net of Tax\nIn addition to the acquired Expansion Territories, the Company also acquired a make-ready center\u201d in Annapolis, Maryland from CCR for approximately $5.3 million in 2015. The cash paid was subsequently adjusted in 2016 as a result of final post-closing adjustments. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The fair value of the net assets acquired totaled $7.3 million, which resulted in a bargain purchase gain of approximately $2.0 million, net of tax of approximately $1.3 million, recorded in 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company's effective tax rate, calculated by dividing income tax expense by income before income taxes, was 34.4% for 2015 and 35.1% for 2014. The decrease in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from a state tax legislation target that was met that caused a reduction to the corporate tax rate in 2015 and reductions to the valuation allowance due to the Company's assessment of the Company's ability to use certain loss carryforwards primarily related to the sale of BYB. The Company's effective tax rate, as calculated by dividing income tax expense by income before income taxes less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, was 36.6% for 2015 and 38.4% for 2014.\nThe Company decreased its valuation allowance by $1.3 million for 2015 and increased its valuation allowance by $1.2 million for 2014. The effect for both years was primarily due to the Company's assessment of its ability to use certain loss carryforwards. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nThe Company recorded net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $6.0 million in 2015 and $4.7 million in 2014 related to the portion of Piedmont owned by The Coca-Cola Company.\nOther Comprehensive Income, Net of Tax\nOther comprehensive income, net of tax, was $7.5 million in 2015 and was primarily a result of actuarial gains on the Company's pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nSegment Operating Results\nThe Company evaluates segment reporting in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting each reporting period, including evaluating the reporting package reviewed by the Chief Operation Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d). The Company has concluded the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as a group, represent the CODM.\nThe Company believes four operating segments exist. Nonalcoholic Beverages represents the vast majority of the Company's consolidated revenues, operating income, and assets. The remaining three operating segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate reporting, either individually or in the aggregate, and therefore have been combined into an All Other\u201d reportable segment.\nPrior to the sale of BYB in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company believed five operating segments existed. Subsequent to this sale, two operating segments, Franchised Nonalcoholic Beverages and Internally-Developed Nonalcoholic Beverages (made up entirely of BYB), were aggregated due to their similar economic characteristics as well as the similarity of products, production processes, types of customers, methods of distribution, and nature of the regulatory environment. This combined segment is Nonalcoholic Beverages.\nThe Company's results for its two reportable segments are as follows:\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonalcoholic Beverages\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,060,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,245,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,710,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 234,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 160,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Eliminations*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (139,241\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (99,569\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (86,865\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,156,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,306,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,746,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonalcoholic Beverages\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 123,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 92,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 82,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 127,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 98,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparable / Adjusted Results\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). However, management believes certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing the Company's ongoing performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting.\nThe following tables reconcile reported GAAP results to comparable results (non-GAAP) for 2016 and

The increase in total assets was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the Expansion Territories in 2016, contributing to an increase in total assets of $418.7 million as of January 1, 2017. In addition, the Company had additions to property, plant and equipment of $172.6 million during 2016, which excludes $227.1 million in property, plant and equipment acquired in the Expansion Transactions completed in 2016.\nNet working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, increased $27.5 million to $135.9 million at January 1, 2017, from $108.4 million at January 3, 2016.\nSignificant changes in net working capital on January 1, 2017 from January 3, 2016 were as follows:\n \u2022 A decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $33.6 million primarily due to acquisitions of Expansion Territories and Regional Manufacturing Facilities. \n \u2022 An increase in accounts receivables, trade of $85.5 million primarily due to accounts receivables from sales in newly acquired territories in 2016. \n \u2022 An increase in accounts receivable from The Coca-Cola Company of $39.0 million and an increase in accounts payable to The Coca-Cola Company of $56.1 million, primarily as a result of activity from newly acquired territories in 2016 and the timing of payments. \n \u2022 An increase in inventories of $54.1 million primarily as a result of inventories acquired from the Expansion Transactions in 2016. \n \u2022 An increase in accounts payable, trade of $33.9 million primarily as a result of the Expansion Transactions in 2016. \n \u2022 An increase in other accrued liabilities of $29.7 million primarily as a result of the timing of payments and an increase in the current portion of acquisition related contingent consideration. \n \u2022 An increase in accrued compensation of $11.0 million primarily as a result of increased incentive compensations accruals resulting from the Company's financial performance. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital Resources\nThe Company's sources of capital include cash flows from operations, available credit facilities and the issuance of debt and equity securities. The Company has obtained the majority of its long-term debt, other than capital leases, from public markets and bank facilities. Management believes the Company has sufficient sources of capital available to refinance its maturing debt, finance its business plan, including the proposed acquisition of previously announced additional Expansion Territories and Regional Manufacturing Facilities, meet its working capital requirements and maintain an appropriate level of capital spending for at least the next 12 months. The amount and frequency of future dividends will be determined by the Company's Board of Directors in light of the earnings and financial condition of the Company at such time, and no assurance can be given that dividends will be declared or paid in the future.\nIn October 2014, the Company entered into a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), and in April 2015, the Company exercised an accordion feature which established a $450 million aggregate maximum borrowing capacity on the Revolving Credit Facility. The $450 million borrowing capacity includes up to $50 million available for the issuance of letters of credit. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a floating base rate or a floating Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin, dependent on the Company's credit rating at the time of borrowing. At the Company's current credit ratings, the Company must pay an annual facility fee of 0.15% of the lenders' aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility has a scheduled maturity date of October 16, 2019.\nThe Company currently believes all of the banks participating in the Company's Revolving Credit Facility have the ability to and will meet any funding requests from the Company. On January 1, 2017, the Company had $152.0 million of outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility. On January 3, 2016, the Company had no outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn June 2016, the Company entered into a five-year term loan agreement for a senior unsecured term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of $300 million, maturing June 7, 2021. The Company may request additional term loans under the agreement, provided the Company's aggregate borrowings under the Term Loan Facility do not exceed $500 million. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a floating base rate or a floating Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin, dependent on the Company's credit rating, at the Company's option. The Company used $210 million of the proceeds from the Term Loan Facility to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company then used the remaining proceeds, as well as borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, to repay the $164.8 million of Senior Notes that matured on June 15, 2016.\nBoth the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility include two financial covenants: a consolidated cash flow/fixed charges ratio and a consolidated funded indebtedness/cash flow ratio, each as defined in the respective agreements. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of January 1, 2017. These covenants do not currently, and the Company does not anticipate they will, restrict its liquidity or capital resources.\nAll outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the Company and none has been issued by any of its subsidiaries. There are no guarantees of the Company's debt.\nThe Company's credit ratings are reviewed periodically by the respective rating agencies. Changes in the Company's operating results or financial position could result in changes in the Company's credit ratings. Lower credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs for the Company or reduced access to capital markets, which could have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. There were no changes in these credit ratings from the prior year and the credit ratings are currently stable. As of January 1, 2017, the Company's credit ratings were as follows:\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Long-Term Debt\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standard & Poor's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> BBB\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Moody's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Baa2\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe indentures under which the Company's public debt was issued do not include financial covenants but do limit the incurrence of certain liens and encumbrances as well as indebtedness by the Company's subsidiaries in excess of certain amounts.\nNet debt and capital lease obligations were summarized as follows:\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 907,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 619,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt and capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 955,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 675,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net debt and capital lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 934,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 619,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The non-GAAP measure Total net debt and capital lease obligations\u201d is used to provide investors with additional information which management believes is helpful in the evaluation of the Company's capital structure and financial leverage. This non-GAAP financial information is not presented elsewhere in this report and may not be comparable to the similarly titled measures used by other companies. Additionally, this information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. \nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk on its floating rate debt, including the Company's $450 million Revolving Credit Facility and its $300 million Term Loan Facility. Assuming no changes in the Company's financial structure, if market interest rates average 1% more over the next twelve months than the interest rates as of January 1, 2017, interest expense for the next twelve months would increase by approximately $4.5 million.

Consolidated (the Company\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company's fiscal year generally ends on the Sunday closest to December 31 of each year. The fiscal years presented are:\n \u2022 The 52-week period ended January 1, 2017 ( 2016\u201d) \n \u2022 The 53-week period ended January 3, 2016 ( 2015\u201d); and \n \u2022 The 52-week period ended December 28, 2014 ( 2014\u201d). \nThe estimated net sales, gross profit and S,D&A expenses for the additional selling week in 2015 were approximately $39 million, $14 million and $10 million, respectively, and were included in reported results in 2015.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the consolidated operations of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries including Piedmont Coca-Cola Bottling Partnership ( Piedmont\u201d). Piedmont is the Company's only subsidiary that has a significant noncontrolling interest. Piedmont distributes and markets nonalcoholic beverages in portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. The Company provides a portion of the nonalcoholic beverage products to Piedmont at cost and receives a fee for managing the operations of Piedmont pursuant to a management agreement. Noncontrolling interest consists of The Coca-Cola Company's interest in Piedmont, which was 22.7% for all periods presented.\nExpansion Transactions with The Coca-Cola Company\nAs part of The Coca-Cola Company's plans to refranchise its North American bottling territories, the Company has engaged in a multi-year series of transactions since April 2013 with The Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. ( CCR\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company, to significantly expand the Company's distribution and manufacturing operations. This expansion includes acquisition of rights to serve additional distribution territories previously served by CCR (the Expansion Territories\u201d) and of related distribution assets (the Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions\u201d), as well as the acquisition of regional manufacturing facilities ( Regional Manufacturing Facilities\u201d) and related manufacturing assets previously owned by CCR (the Manufacturing Facility Expansion Transactions\u201d and, together with the Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions, the Expansion Transactions\u201d).\nDistribution Territory Expansion Transactions\nIn April 2013, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent with The Coca-Cola Company to acquire Expansion Territories in parts of Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana, all of which were acquired by the second quarter of 2015.\nIn May 2015, the Company completed an exchange transaction with CCR through which the Company acquired certain assets and rights for territory in Lexington, Kentucky from CCR and transferred certain assets and rights for territory in Jackson, Tennessee to CCR. The assets exchanged relate to the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of Coca-Cola and other beverage products in each territory, including the rights to produce such beverages in each territory included in the exchange.\nIn May 2015, the Company also entered into a second non-binding letter of intent (the May 2015 LOI\u201d) with The Coca-Cola Company to acquire Expansion Territories in Baltimore, Maryland; Alexandria, Norfolk and Richmond, Virginia; the District of Columbia; Cincinnati, Columbus and Dayton, Ohio; and Indianapolis, Indiana. Pursuant to the May 2015 LOI, CCR would:\n (i) Grant the Company in two phases certain exclusive rights for the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of The Coca-Cola Company-owned and licensed products in additional territories served by CCR; and \n (ii) Sell the Company certain assets that included rights to distribute those cross-licensed brands distributed in the territories by CCR as well as the assets used by CCR in the distribution of the cross-licensed brands and The Coca-Cola Company brands. \nThe first phase of the additional Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions contemplated by the May 2015 LOI was agreed upon in an asset purchase agreement entered into by the Company and CCR in September 2015 (the September 2015 APA\u201d). The September 2015 APA included Expansion Territory in: (i) eastern and northern Virginia, (ii) the entire state of Maryland, (iii) the District of Columbia, and (iv) parts of Delaware, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and was completed by the second quarter of 2016. Following is a summary of key closing dates for the transactions covered by the September 2015 APA:\n \u2022 October 30, 2015 - The first closing under the September 2015 APA occurred for territories served by distribution facilities in Norfolk, Fredericksburg and Staunton, Virginia and Elizabeth City, North Carolina. \n \u2022 January 29, 2016 - The second closing under the September 2015 APA occurred for territories served by distribution facilities in Easton and Salisbury, Maryland and Richmond and Yorktown, Virginia. \n \u2022 April 1, 2016 - The third closing under the September 2015 APA occurred for territories served by distribution facilities in Capitol Heights and La Plata, Maryland and Alexandria, Virginia. \n \u2022 April 29, 2016 - The final closing under the September 2015 APA occurred for territories served by distribution facilities in Baltimore, Cumberland and Hagerstown, Maryland. \nOn September 1, 2016, the Company and CCR entered into an asset purchase agreement (the September 2016 Distribution APA\u201d) for the second phase of the additional distribution territory contemplated by the May 2015 LOI and for a portion of the additional distribution territory contemplated by the CCR June 2016 LOI, including territories located in (i) central and southern Ohio, (ii) northern Kentucky, (iii) large portions of Indiana and (iv) parts of Illinois and West Virginia that are currently served by CCR.

As a result of subsequent discussions with The Coca-Cola Company, in September 2015, the Company and The Coca-Cola Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent (the September 2016 LOI\u201d) pursuant to which CCR would sell six Regional Manufacturing Facilities and related manufacturing assets (collectively, the Manufacturing Assets\u201d) to the Company as the Company becomes a regional producing bottler ( Regional Producing Bottler\u201d) in the national product supply system. Similar to, and as an integral part of, the Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions described in the May 2015 LOI, the sale of the Manufacturing Assets by CCR to the Company would be accomplished in two phases: (i) the first phase would include three Regional Manufacturing Facilities located in Sandston, Virginia; Silver Spring, Maryland; and Baltimore, Maryland and (ii) the second phase would include three Regional Manufacturing Facilities located in Indianapolis, Indiana; Portland Indiana; and Cincinnati, Ohio.\nOn October 30, 2015, the Company and CCR entered into an asset purchase agreement (the October 2015 APA\u201d) for the first phase of the Regional Manufacturing Facilities acquisitions contemplated by the September 2015 LOI, including Regional Manufacturing Facilities located in Sandston, Virginia; Silver Spring, Maryland; and Baltimore, Maryland, and was completed by the second quarter of 2016.

On October 28, 2016, the first closing under the September 2016 Manufacturing APA occurred for the Regional Manufacturing Facility in Cincinnati, Ohio.\nThe rights for the manufacture, production and packaging of specified beverages at the Regional Manufacturing Facilities acquired by the Company have been granted by The Coca-Cola Company to the Company pursuant to an initial regional manufacturing agreement in the form disclosed in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 5, 2016 (the Initial RMA\u201d). Pursuant to its terms, the Initial RMA will be amended, restated and converted into a final form of regional manufacturing agreement (the Final RMA\u201d) concurrent with the conversion of the Company's Bottling Agreements (as defined below) to the Final CBA as described in the description of the Territory Conversion Agreement (defined and described below).\nUnder the Final RMA, the Company's aggregate business directly and primarily related to the manufacture of Authorized Covered Beverages, permitted cross-licensed brands and other beverages and beverage products for The Coca-Cola Company will be subject to the same agreed upon sale process provisions included in the Final CBA as described below, which include the need to obtain The Coca-Cola Company's prior approval of a potential purchaser of such manufacturing business. The Coca-Cola Company will also have the right to terminate the Final RMA in the event of an uncured default by the Company.\nAnnapolis Make-Ready Center Acquisition\nAs a part of the Expansion Transactions, on October 30, 2015, the Company acquired from CCR a make-ready center\u201d in Annapolis, Maryland for a cash purchase price of $5.4 million, which includes all post-closing adjustments. The Company recorded a bargain purchase gain of approximately $2.0 million on this transaction after applying a deferred tax liability of approximately $1.3 million. The Company uses the make-ready center to deploy and refurbish vending and other sales equipment for use in the marketplace.\nThe net cash purchase price for each of the Expansion Transactions, which includes both Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions and Manufacturing Facility Expansion Transactions, completed as of January 1, 2017, is as follows:\n\n * NOTE: The cash purchase price amounts are subject to a final post-closing adjustment and, as a result, may either increase or decrease. \nThe financial results of the Expansion Transactions, Expansion Territories and Lexington Expansion Territory have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition or exchange dates. These territories contributed the following amounts to the Company's consolidated statement of operations:\n\n (1) Includes the results of the 2016 Expansion Transactions and the 2015 Expansion Territories. \n (2) Includes the results of the 2015 Expansion Territories and the 2014 Expansion Territories. \n2016 Letters of Intent for Additional Expansion Transactions\nIn February 2016, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent (the February 2016 LOI\u201d) with The Coca-Cola Company to provide exclusive distribution rights for the Company in following major markets: Akron, Elyria, Toledo, Willoughby, and Youngstown County in Ohio. Pursuant to the February 2016 LOI, CCR would:\n (i) Grant the Company exclusive rights for the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of The Coca-Cola Company-owned and -licensed products in additional territories served by CCR in northern Ohio; \n (ii) Sell the Company certain assets that included rights to distribute those cross-licensed brands distributed in the territories by CCR as well as the assets used by CCR in the distribution of the cross-licensed brands and The Coca-Cola Company brands; and \n (iii) Sell to the Company an additional Regional Manufacturing Facility currently owned by CCR located in Twinsburg, Ohio and related Manufacturing Assets. \nIn June 2016, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent (the CCR June 2016 LOI\u201d) with The Coca-Cola Company to provide exclusive distribution rights for the Company in the following major markets: Little Rock, West Memphis and southern Arkansas; Memphis, Tennessee; and Louisa, Kentucky. Pursuant to the CCR June 2016 LOI, CCR would:\n (i) Grant the Company exclusive rights for the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of The Coca-Cola Company-owned and -licensed products in additional territories in northeastern Kentucky and southwestern West Virginia served by CCR's distribution center in Louisa, Kentucky; \n (ii) Sell the Company certain assets that included rights to distribute those cross-licensed brands distributed in the territories by CCR as well as the assets used by CCR in the distribution of the cross-licensed brands and The Coca-Cola Company brands; and \n (iii) Transfer exclusive rights and associated distribution assets and working capital for territory in parts of Arkansas, southwestern Tennessee and northwestern Mississippi and two additional Regional Manufacturing Facilities located in Memphis, Tennessee and West Memphis, Arkansas currently owned by CCR in exchange for territory in southern Alabama, southern Mississippi and southern Georgia and a Regional Manufacturing Facility in Mobile, Alabama currently owned by the Company. The exchange includes rights to the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of The Coca-Cola Company-owned and -licensed products and certain cross-licensed brands in each territory and related Manufacturing Assets. \nIn June 2016, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Coca-Cola Bottling Company United, Inc. ( United\u201d), an independent bottler that is unrelated to the Company (the United June 2016 LOI\u201d). Pursuant to this letter of intent, United would transfer exclusive rights and associated distribution assets and working capital in certain territory in and around Spartanburg and Bluffton, South Carolina, currently served by United's distribution centers located in Spartanburg, South Carolina and Savannah, Georgia, in exchange for certain territory in south-central Tennessee, northwest Alabama and northwest Florida currently served by the Company's distribution centers located in Florence, Alabama and Panama City, Florida. The exchange includes rights to the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of The Coca-Cola Company-owned and -licensed products and certain cross-licensed brands in each territory.\nAs discussed above, on October 28, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of territories served by the distribution facility in Louisa, Kentucky contemplated by the CCR June 2016 LOI. The Company is continuing to work towards a definitive agreement or agreements with The Coca-Cola Company and CCR for the remaining proposed Expansion Transactions described in the February 2016 LOI and the CCR June 2016 LOI. The Company is also continuing to work towards a definitive agreement or agreements with United for the proposed transactions described in the United June 2016 LOI.\nNational Product Supply Governance Agreement (the NPSG Governance Agreement\u201d)\nIn October 2015, the Company, The Coca-Cola Company and three other Coca-Cola bottlers, including CCR, who are considered Regional Producing Bottlers\u201d ( RPBs\u201d) in The Coca-Cola Company's national product supply system, entered into the NPSG Governance Agreement. Pursuant to the NPSG Governance Agreement, The Coca-Cola Company and the RPBs have formed a national product supply group (the NPSG\u201d) and agreed to certain binding governance mechanisms, including a governing board (the NPSG Board\u201d) comprised of a representative of (i) the Company, (ii) The Coca-Cola Company and (iii) each other Regional Producing Bottler. As The Coca-Cola Company continues its multi-year refranchising effort of its North American bottling territories, additional Regional Producing Bottlers may be added to the NPSG Board. As of January 2017, the NPSG Board consisted of The Coca-Cola-Company, the Company and five other RPBs, including CCR.\nThe stated objectives of the NPSG include, among others, (i) Coca-Cola system strategic infrastructure investment and divestment planning; (ii) network optimization of all plant to distribution center sourcing; and (iii) new product/packaging infrastructure planning.\nThe NPSG Board makes and/or oversees and directs certain key decisions regarding the NPSG, including decisions regarding the management and staffing of the NPSG and the funding for the ongoing operations of the NPSG. The Company is obligated to pay a certain portion of the costs of operating the NPSG. Pursuant to the decisions of the NPSG Board made from time to time and subject to the terms and conditions of the NPSG Governance Agreement, the Company and each other Regional Producing Bottler will make investments in their respective manufacturing assets and will implement Coca-Cola system strategic investment opportunities that are consistent with the NPSG Governance Agreement.\nTerritory Conversion Agreement\nConcurrent with their execution of the September 2015 APA, the Company, CCR and The Coca-Cola Company executed a territory conversion agreement (as amended February 8, 2016, the Territory Conversion Agreement\u201d), which provides that, subject to certain exceptions, all of the Company's master bottle contracts, allied bottle contracts, Initial CBAs and other bottling agreements with The Coca-Cola Company or CCR that authorize the Company to produce and/or distribute the Covered Beverages or Related Products, as defined therein, (collectively, the Bottling Agreements\u201d) would be amended, restated and converted, upon the occurrence of certain events described below, to a new and final comprehensive beverage agreement (the Final CBA\u201d).\nThe conversion would include all of the Company's then existing Bottling Agreements in the Expansion Territories and all other territories in the United States where the Company has rights to market, promote, distribute and sell beverage products owned or licensed by The Coca-Cola Company (the Legacy Territories\u201d), but would not affect any Bottling Agreements with respect to the greater Lexington, Kentucky territory. At the time of the conversion of the Bottling Agreements for the Legacy Territories to the Final CBA, CCR will pay a fee to the Company in cash, or another mutually agreed form of payment or credit, in an amount equivalent to 0.5 times the EBITDA the Company generates from sales in the Legacy Territories of Beverages (as defined in the Final CBA) either (i) owned by The Coca-Cola Company or licensed to The Coca-Cola Company and sublicensed to the Company, or (ii) owned by or licensed to Monster Energy Company ( Monster\u201d) on which the Company pays, and The Coca-Cola Company receives, a facilitation fee.\nThe Company may elect to cause the conversion of the Bottling Agreements to the Final CBA to occur at any time by giving written notice to The Coca-Cola Company. As the transactions contemplated by the September 2015 APA have now been consummated, the conversion will occur automatically upon the earliest of (i) the consummation of all remaining transactions described in the September 2016 Distribution APA (the Subsequent Phase Territory Transactions\u201d), (ii) January 1, 2020, as long as The Coca-Cola Company has satisfied certain obligations described in the Territory Conversion Agreement regarding its intent to complete the Subsequent Phase Territory Transactions, or (iii) 30 days following the Company's (a) termination of good faith negotiations of the Subsequent Phase Territory Transactions on terms similar to the terms for the transactions completed under the September 2015 APA or (b) notification that it no longer wants to pursue the Subsequent Phase Territory Transactions.\nThe Final CBA is similar to the Initial CBA in many respects, but also includes certain modifications and several new business, operational and governance provisions. For example, the Final CBA contains provisions that apply in the event of a potential sale of the Company or its aggregate businesses directly and primarily related to the marketing, promotion, distribution, and sale of Covered Beverages and Related Products (collectively, the Business\u201d). Under the Final CBA, the Company may only sell the Business to The Coca-Cola Company or third party buyers approved by The Coca-Cola Company. The Company annually can obtain a list of such approved third party buyers from The Coca-Cola Company or, upon receipt of a third party offer to purchase the Business, may seek approval of such buyer by The Coca-Cola Company. In addition, the Final CBA contains a sale process that would apply if the Company notifies The Coca-Cola Company that it wishes to sell the Business to The Coca-Cola Company.\nIn such event, if the Company and The Coca-Cola Company are unable in good faith to negotiate terms and conditions of a binding purchase and sale agreement, including the purchase price for the Business, then the Company may either withdraw from negotiations with The Coca-Cola Company or initiate a third-party valuation process described in the Final CBA to determine the purchase price for the Business. Upon such third party's determination of the purchase price, the Company may decide to continue with its potential sale of the Business to The Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company would then have the option to (i) purchase the Business for such purchase price pursuant to defined terms and conditions set forth in the Final CBA, including, to the extent not otherwise agreed by the Company and The Coca-Cola Company, default non-price terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement, or (ii) elect not to purchase the Business, in which case the Final CBA would automatically be amended to, among other things, permit the Company to sell the Business to any third party without obtaining The Coca-Cola Company's prior approval of such third party.\nThe Final CBA also includes terms that would apply in the event The Coca-Cola Company terminates the Final CBA following the Company's default thereunder. These terms include a requirement that The Coca-Cola Company acquire the Business upon such termination as well as the purchase price payable to the Company in such sale. The Final CBA specifies that the purchase price would be determined in accordance with a third-party valuation process equivalent to that employed if the Company notifies The Coca-Cola Company that it desires to sell the Business to The Coca-Cola Company; provided, the purchase price would be 85%\nof the valuation of the Business determined in the third-party valuation process if the Final CBA is terminated as a result of the Company's willful misconduct in violating certain obligations in the Final CBA with respect to dealing in other beverage products and other business activities, if a change in control occurs without the consent of The Coca-Cola Company or if the Company disposes of a majority of the voting power of any subsidiary of the Company that is a party to an agreement regarding the distribution or sale of Covered Beverages or Related Products.\nUnder the Final CBA, the Company will be required to ensure it achieves an equivalent case volume per capita change rate that is not less than one standard deviation below the median of such rates for all U.S. Coca-Cola bottlers. If the Company fails to comply with the equivalent case volume per capita change rate obligation for two consecutive years, it would have a twelve-month cure period to achieve an equivalent case volume per capita change rate within such standard before it would be considered in breach under the Final CBA and the previously described termination provisions are triggered. The Final CBA also requires the Company to make minimum, ongoing capital expenditures at a specified level.\nSale of BYB Brands, Inc.\nOn August 24, 2015, the Company sold BYB Brands, Inc. ( BYB\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company to The Coca-Cola Company. Pursuant to the stock purchase agreement dated July 22, 2015, the Company sold all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of BYB for a cash purchase price of $26.4 million. As a result of the sale, the Company recognized a gain of $22.7 million, which was recorded to Gain on sale of business in the consolidated financial statements in 2015. BYB contributed the following amounts to the Company's consolidated statement of operations:\n\nMonster Distribution Agreement\nIn March 2015, the Company and Monster Energy Company ( Monster\u201d) entered into a distribution agreement granting the Company rights to distribute energy drink products packaged and/or marketed by Monster throughout all geographic territories the Company currently services for the distribution of Coca-Cola products, commencing April 6, 2015. Previously, the Company only distributed Monster products in certain portions of the Company's territories.\nNet Sales by Product Category\nThe Company's net sales in the last three fiscal years by product category were as follows:\n\n * NOTE: During the second quarter of 2016, energy products were moved from the category of sparkling beverages to still beverages, which has been reflected in all periods presented. Total bottle/can sales remain unchanged in prior periods. \nAreas of Emphasis\nKey priorities for the Company include territory and manufacturing expansion, revenue management, product innovation and beverage portfolio expansion, distribution cost management, and productivity.\nRevenue Management: Revenue management requires a strategy that reflects consideration for pricing of brands and packages within product categories and channels, highly effective working relationships with customers and disciplined fact-based decision-making. Revenue management has been and continues to be a key driver which has a significant impact on the Company's results of operations.\nProduct Innovation and Beverage Portfolio Expansion: Innovation of both new brands and packages has been and is expected to continue to be important to the Company's overall revenue. Recent product introductions from the Company and The Coca-Cola Company include new flavor varieties within certain brands such as Fanta Sparkling Fruit, Minute Maid Refreshment, Monster, Dasani Drops, NOS, and Dasani Sparkling. New packaging introductions over the last several years include the 253 ml bottle, the 1.25-liter bottle, the 7.5-ounce sleek can, the 2-liter contour bottle for Coca-Cola products, and the 16-ounce bottle/24-ounce bottle package.\nDistribution Cost Management: Distribution costs represent the costs of transporting finished goods from Company locations to customer outlets. Total distribution costs amounted to $314.3 million, $222.9 million and $211.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Management of these costs will continue to be a key area of emphasis for the Company.\nThe Company has three primary delivery systems:\n \u2022 bulk delivery for large supermarkets, mass merchandisers and club stores; \n \u2022 advanced sale delivery for convenience stores, drug stores, small supermarkets and on-premises accounts; and \n \u2022 full service delivery for its full service vending customers. \nProductivity: A key driver in the Company's selling, delivery and administrative ( S,D&A\u201d) expense management relates to ongoing improvements in labor productivity and asset productivity.\nItems Impacting Operations and Financial Condition\nThe comparison of operating results for 2015 to the operating results for 2016 and 2014 are affected by the impact of one additional selling week in 2015 due to the Company's fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to December 31st. The estimated net sales, gross profit and S,D&A expenses for the additional selling week in 2015 of approximately $39 million, $14 million and $10 million, respectively, are included in reported results in 2015.\nThe following items also affect the comparability of the financial results presented below:\n \u2022 $1.06 billion in net sales and $24.3 million of operating income related to the Expansion Territories and Regional Manufacturing Facilities; \n \u2022 $32.3 million of expenses related to acquiring and transitioning Expansion Territories and Regional Manufacturing Facilities; \n \u2022 $4.7 million pretax favorable mark-to-market adjustments related to our commodity hedging program\u037e \n \u2022 $4.0 million of additional expense related to increased charitable contributions; and \n \u2022 $1.9 million recorded in other expense as a result of a favorable fair value adjustment to the Company's contingent consideration liability related to the Expansion Territories\u037e \n \u2022 $437.0 million in net sales and $6.9 million of operating income related to Expansion Territories; \n \u2022 $22.7 million gain on the sale of BYB; \n \u2022 $20.0 million of expenses related to acquiring and transitioning Expansion Territories; \n \u2022 $8.8 million gain on the exchange of certain Expansion Territories and related assets and liabilities; \n \u2022 $3.6 million recorded in other expense as a result of an unfavorable fair value adjustment to the Company's contingent consideration liability related to the Expansion Territories; \n \u2022 $3.4 million pre-tax unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments related to our commodity hedging program; \n \u2022 $45.1 million in net sales and $3.4 million of operating income related to Expansion Territories; \n \u2022 $12.9 million of expenses related to acquiring and transitioning Expansion Territories; and \n \u2022 $1.1 million recorded in other expense as a result of an unfavorable fair value adjustment to the Company's contingent consideration liability related to the Expansion Territories. \nResults of Operations\n2016 Compared to 2015\nA summary of the Company's financial results for 2016 and 2015:\n\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $850.0 million, or 36.9%, to $3.16 billion in 2016, as compared to $2.31 billion in 2015. The increase in net sales was principally attributable to the following (in millions):\n\nThe Company's bottle/can sales to retail customers accounted for approximately 84% of the Company's total net sales in 2016, as compared to approximately 82% in 2015. Bottle/can net pricing is based on the invoice price charged to customers reduced by promotional allowances. Bottle/can net pricing per unit is impacted by the price charged per package, the volume generated in each package and the channels in which those packages are sold.\nProduct category sales volume in 2016 and 2015 as a percentage of total bottle/can sales volume and the percentage change by product category were as follows:\n\nBottle/can volume to retail customers, excluding Expansion Territories, increased 3.3%, which represented a 0.8% increase in sparkling beverages and a 10.3% increase in still beverages in 2016, as compared to 2015. The increase in still beverages was primarily due to increases in energy beverages, which was primarily due to the Company expanding the territories in which it distributes Monster products.\nThe Company's products are sold and distributed through various channels, which include selling directly to retail stores and other outlets such as food markets, institutional accounts and vending machine outlets. During 2016, approximately 66% of the Company's bottle/can volume to retail customers was sold for future consumption, while the remaining bottle/can volume to retail customers was sold for immediate consumption. All the Company's beverage sales were to customers in the United States. The Company recorded delivery fees in net sales of $6.0 million in 2016 and $6.3 million in 2015. These fees are used to offset a portion of the Company's delivery and handling costs.\nThe following table summarizes the percentage of the Company's total bottle/can volume and the percentage of the Company's total net sales, which are all included in the Nonalcoholic Beverages operating segment, attributed to its largest customers:\n\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales includes the following: raw material costs, manufacturing labor, manufacturing overhead including depreciation expense, manufacturing warehousing costs, shipping and handling costs related to the movement of finished goods from manufacturing locations to sales distribution centers and purchase of finished goods.\nCost of sales increased $535.3 million, or 38.1%, to $1.94 billion in 2016, as compared to $1.41 billion in 2015. The increase in cost of sales was principally attributable to the following (in millions):\n\nThe following inputs represent a substantial portion of the Company's total cost of sales: (i) sweeteners, (ii) packaging materials, including plastic bottles and aluminum cans, and (iii) finished products purchased from other vendors.\nThe Company relies extensively on advertising and sales promotion in the marketing of its products. The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies that supply concentrates, syrups and finished products to the Company make substantial marketing and advertising expenditures to promote sales in the local territories served by the Company. The Company also benefits from national advertising programs conducted by The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies. Certain of the marketing expenditures by The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies are made pursuant to annual arrangements. Total marketing funding support from The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies, which includes direct payments to the Company and payments to customers for marketing programs, was $99.4 million in 2016, as compared to $72.2 million in 2015.\nThe Company's cost of sales may not be comparable to other peer companies, as some include all costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales. The Company includes a portion of these costs in S,D&A expenses.\nS,D&A Expenses\nS,D&A expenses include the following: sales management labor costs, distribution costs from sales distribution centers to customer locations, sales distribution center warehouse costs, depreciation expense related to sales centers, delivery vehicles and cold drink equipment, point-of-sale expenses, advertising expenses, cold drink equipment repair costs, amortization of intangibles and administrative support labor and operating costs.\nS,D&A expenses increased by $285.0 million, or 35.5%, to $1.09 billion in 2016, as compared to $802.9 million in 2015. S,D&A expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 34.5% in 2016 from 34.8% in 2015. The increase in S,D&A expenses was principally attributable to the following (in millions):\n\nShipping and handling costs related to the movement of finished goods from manufacturing locations to sales distribution centers are included in cost of sales. Shipping and handling costs related to the movement of finished goods from sales distribution centers to customer locations are included in S,D&A expenses and totaled $314.3 million in 2016 and $222.9 million in 2015.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net, increased $7.4 million, or 25.6%, to $36.3 million in 2016, as compared to $28.9 million in 2015. The increase was primarily a result of additional borrowings to finance the territory expansion.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, included noncash income of $1.9 million in 2016 and a noncash expense of $3.6 million in 2015 as a result of fair value adjustments of the Company's contingent consideration liability related to the Expansion Territories. The adjustment was primarily a result of a change in the risk-free interest rates. As the contingent consideration is calculated using 40 years of discounted cash flows, any reductions in contingent consideration due to current payments of the liability are effectively marked to market at the next reporting period, assuming interest rates and future projections remain constant.\nEach reporting period, the Company adjusts its contingent consideration liability related to the newly-acquired distribution territories to fair value. The fair value is determined by discounting future expected sub-bottling payments required under the CBAs using the Company's estimated weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d), which is impacted by many factors, including the risk-free interest rate. These future expected sub-bottling payments extend through the life of the related distribution asset acquired in each distribution territory expansion, which is generally 40 years. In addition, the Company is required to pay quarterly the current portion of the sub-bottling fee. As a result, the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration liability is impacted by the Company's estimated WACC, management's best estimate of the amounts of sub-bottling payments that will be paid in the future under the CBAs, and current period sub-bottling payments made. Changes in any of these factors, particularly the underlying risk-free interest rate used to estimate the Company's WACC, could materially impact the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration and consequently the amount of noncash expense (or income) recorded each reporting period.\nGain (Loss) on Exchange of Franchise Territory\nDuring 2015, the Company and CCR completed a like-kind exchange transaction where CCR agreed to exchange certain assets of CCR relating to the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of Coca-Cola and other beverage products in the territory served by CCR's facilities and equipment located in Lexington, Kentucky in exchange for certain assets of the Company relating to the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of Coca-Cola and other beverage products in the territory served by the Company's facilities and equipment located in Jackson, Tennessee. The fair value in 2015 of the Lexington net assets acquired totaled $36.8 million and the Company paid cash of approximately $10.5 million. The carrying value of the Jackson net assets was $17.5 million, resulting in a net gain of $8.8 million. The balances of net assets acquired and cash paid were subsequently adjusted in 2016 as a result of final post-closing adjustments. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nGain on Sale of Business\nDuring 2015, the Company sold BYB, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to The Coca-Cola Company. The Company received cash proceeds of $26.4 million. The net assets of BYB at closing totaled $3.7 million, which resulted in a gain of $22.7 million in 2015.\nBargain Purchase Gain, Net of Tax\nIn addition to the acquired Expansion Territories, the Company also acquired a make-ready center\u201d in Annapolis, Maryland from CCR for approximately $5.3 million in 2015. The cash paid was subsequently adjusted in 2016 as a result of final post-closing adjustments. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The fair value of the net assets acquired totaled $7.3 million, which resulted in a bargain purchase gain of approximately $2.0 million, net of tax of approximately $1.3 million, recorded in 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company's effective tax rate, calculated by dividing income tax expense by income before income taxes, was 38.9% for 2016 and 34.4% for 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate was driven primarily by a decrease to the favorable manufacturing deduction, as a percentage of pre-tax income, less of a decrease to the valuation allowance in 2016 as compared to 2015, and an increase in non-deductible travel expense. The Company's effective tax rate, calculated by dividing income tax expense by income before income taxes minus net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, was 41.8% for 2016 and 36.6% for 2015.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nThe Company recorded net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $6.5 million in 2016 and $6.0 million in 2015 related to the portion of Piedmont owned by The Coca-Cola Company.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax\nOther comprehensive loss, net of tax, was $10.5 million in 2016 and was primarily a result of actuarial losses on the Company's pension and postretirement benefit plans.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nA summary of the Company's financial results for 2015 and 2014 follows:\n\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $560.1 million, or 32.1%, to $2.31 billion in 2015, as compared to $1.75 billion in 2014. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to the following (in millions):\n\nThe Company's bottle/can sales to retail customers accounted for approximately 82% of the Company's total net sales in 2015, as compared to approximately 80% in 2014. Product category sales volume in 2015 and 2014 as a percentage of total bottle/can sales volume and the percentage change by product category were as follows:\n\nBottle/can volume to retail customers, excluding Expansion Territories, increased 6.0%, which represented a 2.1% increase in sparkling beverages and a 19.9% increase in still beverages in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nDuring 2015, approximately 68% of the Company's bottle/can volume to retail customers was sold for future consumption, while the remaining bottle/can volume to retail customers was sold for immediate consumption. All the Company's beverage sales were to customers in the United States. The Company recorded delivery fees in net sales of $6.3 million in 2015 and $6.2 million in 2014.\nThe following table summarizes the percentage of the Company's total bottle/can volume and the percentage of the Company's total net sales, which are all included in the Nonalcoholic Beverages operating segment, attributed to its largest customers:\n\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales increased $364.3 million, or 35.0%, to $1.41 billion in 2015, as compared to $1.04 billion in 2014. The increase in cost of sales was principally attributable to the following (in millions):\n\nTotal marketing funding support from The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies, which includes direct payments to the Company and payments to customers for marketing programs, was $72.2 million in 2015, as compared to $55.4 million in 2014.\nS,D&A Expenses\nS,D&A expenses increased by $183.6 million, or 29.7%, to $802.9 million in 2015, as compared to $619.3 million in 2014. S,D&A expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 34.8% in 2015 from 35.5% in 2014. The increase in S,D&A expenses was principally attributable to the following (in millions):\n\nShipping and handling costs related to the movement of finished goods from sales distribution centers to customer locations totaled $222.9 million in 2015 and $211.6 million in 2014.\nS,D&A expense of $1.6 million in 2015 and $0.2 million in 2014 was recorded for the two Company-sponsored pension plans.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, the Company matched the maximum 5% of participants' contributions on its 401(k) Savings Plan, for a total expense of $9.4 million and $7.7 million, respectively.\nCertain employees of the Company participate in a multi-employer pension plan, the Employers-Teamsters Local Union Nos. 175 and 505 Pension Fund (the Teamsters Plan\u201d), to which the Company makes monthly contributions on behalf of such employees. In 2015, the Company increased the contribution rates to the Teamsters Plan, with additional increases occurring annually, as part of a rehabilitation plan. This is a result of the Teamsters Plan being certified by its actuary as being in critical\u201d status for the plan year beginning January 1, 2013, which was incorporated into the renewal of collective bargaining agreements with the unions, effective April 28, 2014, and adopted by the Company as a rehabilitation plan, effective January 1, 2015.\nIf the Company chooses to stop participating in the Teamsters Plan, the Company could be required to pay the Teamsters Plan a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the Teamsters Plan. The Company does not anticipate withdrawing from the Teamsters Plan.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net, decreased $0.4 million, or 1.2%, to $28.9 million in 2015, as compared to $29.3 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in the Company's overall weighted average interest rate on its debt and capital lease obligations to 4.7% during 2015 from 5.7% during 2014.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, included a noncash expense of $3.6 million in 2015 and a noncash expense of $1.1 million in 2014 as a result of an unfavorable fair value adjustment of the Company's contingent consideration liability related to the Expansion Territories. The adjustment was primarily driven by current payments of sub-bottler fees in 2015. As the contingent consideration is calculated using 40 years of discounted cash flows, any reductions in contingent consideration due to current payments of the liability are effectively marked to market at the next reporting period, assuming interest rates and future projections remain constant.\nGain (Loss) on Exchange of Franchise Territory\nDuring 2015, the Company and CCR completed a like-kind exchange transaction where CCR agreed to exchange certain assets of CCR relating to the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of Coca-Cola and other beverage products in the territory served by CCR's facilities and equipment located in Lexington, Kentucky in exchange for certain assets of the Company relating to the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of Coca-Cola and other beverage products in the territory served by the Company's facilities and equipment located in Jackson, Tennessee. The fair value in 2015 of the Lexington net assets acquired totaled $36.8 million and the Company paid cash of approximately $10.5 million. The carrying value of the Jackson net assets was $17.5 million, resulting in a net gain of $8.8 million. The balances of net assets acquired and cash paid were subsequently adjusted in 2016 as a result of final post-closing adjustments. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nGain on Sale of Business\nDuring 2015, the Company sold BYB, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to The Coca-Cola Company. The Company received cash proceeds of $26.4 million. The net assets of BYB at closing totaled $3.7 million, which resulted in a gain of $22.7 million in 2015.\nBargain Purchase Gain, Net of Tax\nIn addition to the acquired Expansion Territories, the Company also acquired a make-ready center\u201d in Annapolis, Maryland from CCR for approximately $5.3 million in 2015. The cash paid was subsequently adjusted in 2016 as a result of final post-closing adjustments. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The fair value of the net assets acquired totaled $7.3 million, which resulted in a bargain purchase gain of approximately $2.0 million, net of tax of approximately $1.3 million, recorded in 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company's effective tax rate, calculated by dividing income tax expense by income before income taxes, was 34.4% for 2015 and 35.1% for 2014. The decrease in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from a state tax legislation target that was met that caused a reduction to the corporate tax rate in 2015 and reductions to the valuation allowance due to the Company's assessment of the Company's ability to use certain loss carryforwards primarily related to the sale of BYB. The Company's effective tax rate, as calculated by dividing income tax expense by income before income taxes less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, was 36.6% for 2015 and 38.4% for 2014.\nThe Company decreased its valuation allowance by $1.3 million for 2015 and increased its valuation allowance by $1.2 million for 2014. The effect for both years was primarily due to the Company's assessment of its ability to use certain loss carryforwards. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nThe Company recorded net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $6.0 million in 2015 and $4.7 million in 2014 related to the portion of Piedmont owned by The Coca-Cola Company.\nOther Comprehensive Income, Net of Tax\nOther comprehensive income, net of tax, was $7.5 million in 2015 and was primarily a result of actuarial gains on the Company's pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nSegment Operating Results\nThe Company evaluates segment reporting in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting each reporting period, including evaluating the reporting package reviewed by the Chief Operation Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d). The Company has concluded the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as a group, represent the CODM.\nThe Company believes four operating segments exist. Nonalcoholic Beverages represents the vast majority of the Company's consolidated revenues, operating income, and assets. The remaining three operating segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate reporting, either individually or in the aggregate, and therefore have been combined into an All Other\u201d reportable segment.\nPrior to the sale of BYB in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company believed five operating segments existed. Subsequent to this sale, two operating segments, Franchised Nonalcoholic Beverages and Internally-Developed Nonalcoholic Beverages (made up entirely of BYB), were aggregated due to their similar economic characteristics as well as the similarity of products, production processes, types of customers, methods of distribution, and nature of the regulatory environment. This combined segment is Nonalcoholic Beverages.\nThe Company's results for its two reportable segments are as follows:\n\nComparable / Adjusted Results\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). However, management believes certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing the Company's ongoing performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting.\nThe following tables reconcile reported GAAP results to comparable results (non-GAAP) for 2016 and 2015:\n\n\nFinancial Condition\nTotal assets increased $602.9 million to $2.45 billion at January 1, 2017, as compared to $1.85 billion at January 3, 2016. The increase in total assets was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the Expansion Territories in 2016, contributing to an increase in total assets of $418.7 million as of January 1, 2017. In addition, the Company had additions to property, plant and equipment of $172.6 million during 2016, which excludes $227.1 million in property, plant and equipment acquired in the Expansion Transactions completed in 2016.\nNet working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, increased $27.5 million to $135.9 million at January 1, 2017, from $108.4 million at January 3, 2016.\nSignificant changes in net working capital on January 1, 2017 from January 3, 2016 were as follows:\n \u2022 A decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $33.6 million primarily due to acquisitions of Expansion Territories and Regional Manufacturing Facilities. \n \u2022 An increase in accounts receivables, trade of $85.5 million primarily due to accounts receivables from sales in newly acquired territories in 2016. \n \u2022 An increase in accounts receivable from The Coca-Cola Company of $39.0 million and an increase in accounts payable to The Coca-Cola Company of $56.1 million, primarily as a result of activity from newly acquired territories in 2016 and the timing of payments. \n \u2022 An increase in inventories of $54.1 million primarily as a result of inventories acquired from the Expansion Transactions in 2016. \n \u2022 An increase in accounts payable, trade of $33.9 million primarily as a result of the Expansion Transactions in 2016. \n \u2022 An increase in other accrued liabilities of $29.7 million primarily as a result of the timing of payments and an increase in the current portion of acquisition related contingent consideration. \n \u2022 An increase in accrued compensation of $11.0 million primarily as a result of increased incentive compensations accruals resulting from the Company's financial performance. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital Resources\nThe Company's sources of capital include cash flows from operations, available credit facilities and the issuance of debt and equity securities. The Company has obtained the majority of its long-term debt, other than capital leases, from public markets and bank facilities. Management believes the Company has sufficient sources of capital available to refinance its maturing debt, finance its business plan, including the proposed acquisition of previously announced additional Expansion Territories and Regional Manufacturing Facilities, meet its working capital requirements and maintain an appropriate level of capital spending for at least the next 12 months. The amount and frequency of future dividends will be determined by the Company's Board of Directors in light of the earnings and financial condition of the Company at such time, and no assurance can be given that dividends will be declared or paid in the future.\nIn October 2014, the Company entered into a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), and in April 2015, the Company exercised an accordion feature which established a $450 million aggregate maximum borrowing capacity on the Revolving Credit Facility. The $450 million borrowing capacity includes up to $50 million available for the issuance of letters of credit. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a floating base rate or a floating Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin, dependent on the Company's credit rating at the time of borrowing. At the Company's current credit ratings, the Company must pay an annual facility fee of 0.15% of the lenders' aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility has a scheduled maturity date of October 16, 2019.\nThe Company currently believes all of the banks participating in the Company's Revolving Credit Facility have the ability to and will meet any funding requests from the Company. On January 1, 2017, the Company had $152.0 million of outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility. On January 3, 2016, the Company had no outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn June 2016, the Company entered into a five-year term loan agreement for a senior unsecured term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of $300 million, maturing June 7, 2021. The Company may request additional term loans under the agreement, provided the Company's aggregate borrowings under the Term Loan Facility do not exceed $500 million. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a floating base rate or a floating Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin, dependent on the Company's credit rating, at the Company's option. The Company used $210 million of the proceeds from the Term Loan Facility to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company then used the remaining proceeds, as well as borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, to repay the $164.8 million of Senior Notes that matured on June 15, 2016.\nBoth the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility include two financial covenants: a consolidated cash flow/fixed charges ratio and a consolidated funded indebtedness/cash flow ratio, each as defined in the respective agreements. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of January 1, 2017. These covenants do not currently, and the Company does not anticipate they will, restrict its liquidity or capital resources.\nAll outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the Company and none has been issued by any of its subsidiaries. There are no guarantees of the Company's debt.\nThe Company's credit ratings are reviewed periodically by the respective rating agencies. Changes in the Company's operating results or financial position could result in changes in the Company's credit ratings. Lower credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs for the Company or reduced access to capital markets, which could have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. There were no changes in these credit ratings from the prior year and the credit ratings are currently stable. As of January 1, 2017, the Company's credit ratings were as follows:\n\nThe indentures under which the Company's public debt was issued do not include financial covenants but do limit the incurrence of certain liens and encumbrances as well as indebtedness by the Company's subsidiaries in excess of certain amounts.\nNet debt and capital lease obligations were summarized as follows:\n\n (1) The non-GAAP measure Total net debt and capital lease obligations\u201d is used to provide investors with additional information which management believes is helpful in the evaluation of the Company's capital structure and financial leverage. This non-GAAP financial information is not presented elsewhere in this report and may not be comparable to the similarly titled measures used by other companies. Additionally, this information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. \nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk on its floating rate debt, including the Company's $450 million Revolving Credit Facility and its $300 million Term Loan Facility. Assuming no changes in the Company's financial structure, if market interest rates average 1% more over the next twelve months than the interest rates as of January 1, 2017, interest expense for the next twelve months would increase by approximately $4.5 million.

Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2017, January 3, 2016, and December 28, 2014. \n\n- The company has been expanding its territory and manufacturing operations through a series of transactions with The Coca-Cola Company. This includes acquiring distribution rights, production facilities, and related assets in parts of several states including Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Virginia, Maryland, Ohio, and others.\n\n- Net sales increased 36.9% in 2016 to $3.16 billion, driven by expanded territories, higher bottle/can volume, and increased pricing. Operating income grew 30.3% to $127.9 million. Net income declined due to higher interest costs and taxes.\n\n- Total assets grew to $2.45 billion in 2017, up $602.9 million, mostly from acquisition of expanded territories. Debt increased to fund acquisitions but liquidity remains adequate.\n\n- Priorities going forward include further territory and manufacturing expansion, revenue management, product innovation, distribution cost control, and productivity improvements.\n\nIn summary, the company continues to expand rapidly through acquisitions while delivering sales and earnings growth. It is financing expansions through debt but maintains adequate financial flexibility. Management is focused on integrating new territories efficiently."}
