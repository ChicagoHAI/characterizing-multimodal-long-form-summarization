MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of TransUnion's financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Information,\u201d including TransUnion's audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nReferences in this discussion and analysis to the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our\u201d refer to TransUnion and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including TransUnion Intermediate Holdings, Inc.\nOverview\nTransUnion is a leading global information and insights company that makes trust possible between businesses and consumers, working to help people around the world access opportunities that can lead to a higher quality of life. That trust is built on TransUnion's ability to deliver safe, innovative solutions with credibility and consistency. We call this Information for Good.\nGrounded in our heritage as a credit reporting agency, we have built robust and accurate databases of information for a large portion of the adult population in the markets we serve. We use our data fusion methodology to link and match an increasing set of disparate data to further enrich our database. We use this enriched data, combined with our expertise, to continuously develop more insightful solutions for our customers, all in accordance with global laws and regulations. Because of our work, organizations can better understand consumers in order to make more informed decisions, and earn consumer trust through great, personalized experiences, and the proactive extension of the right opportunities, tools and offers. In turn, we believe consumers can be confident that their data identities will result in better offers and opportunities.\nWe provide solutions that enable businesses to manage and measure credit risk, market to new and existing customers, verify consumer identities, mitigate fraud, and effectively manage call center operations. Businesses embed our solutions into their process workflows to deliver critical insights and enable effective actions. Consumers use our solutions to view their credit profiles and access analytical tools that help them understand and manage their personal financial information and take precautions against identity theft. We have deep domain expertise across a number of attractive industries, which we also refer to as verticals, including Financial Services and the Emerging Verticals, consisting of Insurance, Services and Collections, Tenant and Employment, Technology, Commerce & Communications, Public Sector, Media, and other emerging verticals we serve, as well as our Neustar business. We have a global presence in over 30 countries and territories across North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, India, and Asia Pacific.\nOur addressable market includes the global data and analytics market, which continues to grow as companies around the world increasingly recognize the benefits of data and analytics-based decision making, and as consumers recognize the important role that their data identities play in their ability to procure goods and services. There are several underlying trends supporting this market growth, including the proliferation of data, advances in technology and analytics that enable data to be processed more quickly and efficiently to provide business insights, and growing demand for these business insights across industries and geographies. Leveraging our established position as a leading provider of information and insights, we have grown our business by expanding the breadth and depth of our data, strengthening our analytics capabilities to deliver innovative solutions, expanding into complementary adjacencies and vertical markets, investing in technology infrastructure to leverage capabilities to best serve our customers and enhancing our global operating model. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to expand our share within the markets we currently serve and capitalize on the larger data and analytics opportunity.\nOur solutions are based on a foundation of data assets across financial, credit, alternative credit, identity, phone activity, digital device information, marketing, bankruptcy, lien, judgment, insurance claims, automotive and other relevant information obtained from thousands of sources including financial institutions, private databases and public records repositories. We refine, standardize and enhance this data using sophisticated algorithms to create proprietary databases. Our acquisition of Neustar, Inc. ( Neustar\u201d), and particularly its OneID platform, will further enhance our ability to deliver real-time, persistent identity resolution of disparate data fragments and attributes, in a privacy compliant manner. Our technology infrastructure allows us to efficiently integrate our data with our analytics and technology capabilities to create and deliver innovative solutions to our customers and to quickly adapt to changing customer needs. Our deep analytics resources, including our people and tools driving predictive modeling and scoring, customer segmentation, benchmarking and forecasting, enable us to provide businesses and consumers with better insights.\nWe leverage our differentiated capabilities in order to serve a global customer base across multiple geographies and industry verticals. We offer our solutions to business customers in Financial Services, Insurance and other industries, and our customer base includes many of the largest companies in the industries we serve. We sell our solutions to leading consumer lending\nbanks, credit card issuers, alternative lenders, online-only lenders ( FinTechs\u201d), Point of Sale ( POS\u201d)/Buy Now Pay Later ( BNPL\u201d) lenders, auto lenders, auto insurance carriers, cable and telecom operators, retailers, and federal, state and local government agencies. We have been successful in leveraging our brand, our expertise and our solutions and have a leading presence in several high-growth international markets. Millions of consumers across the globe also use our data to help manage their personal finances and take precautions against identity theft.\nWe believe we have an attractive business model that has recurring and diversified revenue streams, low capital requirements, significant operating leverage and strong and stable cash flows. The proprietary and embedded nature of our solutions and the integral role that we play in our customers' decision-making processes have historically translated into high customer retention and revenue visibility. We continue to deliver organic growth by increasing our sales to existing customers, developing new solutions and gaining new customers. We have a diversified portfolio of businesses across our segments, reducing our exposure to cyclical trends in any particular industry vertical or geography. We operate primarily on contributory data models in which we typically obtain updated information including a growing set of public record and alternative data, at little or no cost, as we develop new solutions and expand into new industries and geographies. We are evolving our hybrid public-private cloud technology infrastructure to ensure that our systems remain highly secure, reliable, scalable, and performant by design. We are focused on processes and foundational technology that allows us to leverage demand-led consumption from public cloud providers and from our high performance privately owned infrastructure.\nSegments\nWe manage our business and report our financial results, including disaggregated revenue, in three reportable segments: U.S. Markets, International and Consumer Interactive.\nU.S. Markets\nThe U.S. Markets segment provides consumer reports, actionable insights and analytics to businesses. These businesses use our services to acquire customers, assess consumers' ability to pay for services, identify cross-selling opportunities, measure and manage debt portfolio risk, collect debt, verify consumer identities and mitigate fraud risk. The core capabilities and delivery methods in our U.S. Markets segment allow us to serve a broad set of customers across industries. We report disaggregated revenue of our U.S. Markets segment for Financial Services and Emerging Verticals. The results of operations of Neustar are included in the Emerging Verticals and our consolidated statements of income since the date of the acquisition.\nInternational\nThe International segment provides services similar to our U.S. Markets segment to businesses in select regions outside the United States. Depending on the maturity of the credit economy in each country, services may include credit reports, analytics and technology solutions services, and other value-added risk management services. We also have insurance, business and automotive databases in select geographies. These services are offered to customers in a number of industries including financial services, retail credit, insurance, automotive, collections, public sector, and communications, and are delivered through both direct and indirect channels. The International segment also provides consumer services similar to those offered by our Consumer Interactive segment that help consumers proactively manage their personal finances.\nWe report disaggregated revenue of our International segment for the following regions: Canada, Latin America, the United Kingdom, Africa, India, and Asia Pacific.\nConsumer Interactive\nThe Consumer Interactive segment offers solutions that help consumers manage their personal finances and take precautions against identity theft. Services in this segment include credit reports and scores, credit monitoring, identity protection and resolution, and financial management for consumers. The segment also provides solutions that help businesses respond to data breach events. Our products are provided through user-friendly online and mobile interfaces and are supported by educational content and customer support. Our Consumer Interactive segment serves consumers through both direct and indirect channels. The results of operations of Sontiq are included in the Consumer Interactive segment and our consolidated statements of income since the date of the acquisition.\nCorporate\nIn addition, Corporate provides support services for each of the segments, holds investments, and conducts enterprise functions. Certain costs incurred in Corporate that are not directly attributable to one or more of the segments remain in Corporate. These costs are typically enterprise-level costs and are primarily administrative in nature.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nThe following are certain key factors that affect, or have recently affected, our results of operations:\nMacroeconomic and Industry Trends, Including the Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Business and Results of Operations\nOur revenues can be significantly influenced by general macroeconomic conditions, including the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of credit and capital, interest rates, inflation, employment levels, consumer confidence and housing demand. During 2020, the economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic had a material and adverse impact on numerous aspects of our business, including our results of operations in all of the markets where we operate. During 2021, we saw steady improvements in our results of operations in all these markets. This dynamic impacts the comparability of our results of operations, including our revenue and expenses, for each of the periods presented below. Also, given ongoing uncertainty and the unpredictable nature of the pandemic, including the rise of variants of the virus and the effectiveness of vaccines against those variants, COVID-19 may have a material and adverse impact on various aspects of our business in the future, including our results of operations.\nIn the markets where we compete, we have seen generally improving macroeconomic conditions since the second quarter of 2020. In the United States, we saw strong and improving macroeconomic conditions throughout 2021, including strong gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) growth, falling unemployment rates, and mortgage interest rates that are still near historic lows, all of which are evident in the significantly improved 2021 results of all of our segments. During 2021, we saw similar improvements in our international markets, although in certain of these markets there remains higher ongoing concerns about the impact of COVID-19. These macroeconomic improvements are evident in our 2021 results of operations, with all of our segments showing ongoing signs of improvements compared with last year.\nWhile we believe that a strong but slowing global GDP growth is expected for the coming year, such expectations are tempered by increasing concerns around rising inflation, geopolitical tensions and existing and new coronavirus variants, as well as waning consumer confidence, interest rate pressures and increasing supply chain and ongoing labor shortage concerns. Also, in certain of our markets, there remains concern regarding the impact COVID-19 could have on our business.\nEffects of Inflation\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. The impact of recent and expected future inflation increases could have a significant negative impact on our business, including decreased demand for our services as a result of rising interest rates.\nRecent Developments\nThe following developments impact the comparability of our balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows between years:\nOn January 24, 2022, we reached a tentative class settlement with the plaintiffs in Ramirez v. Trans Union LLC ( Ramirez\u201d or the Ramirez Litigation\u201d), which will require court approval. We expect this matter to be resolved by the end of 2022. Accordingly, in 2021, we revised the amount of the probable loss that we previously estimated, resulting in a reduction of our estimated liability and partially offsetting insurance receivable, and a corresponding net reduction recorded in selling, general and administrative expense for the year end December 31, 2021. See Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 22, Contingencies\u201d for additional information.\nDuring 2020, the economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic had a material and adverse impact on numerous aspects of our business, including the results of operations in all of our segments. During 2021, we saw ongoing improvements in our results of operations in all of the markets where we operate. This dynamic impacts the comparability of our results of operations between all of the periods presented below.\nOn December 23, 2021, we entered into a tranche of interest rate swap agreements with various counter-parties that effectively fix our LIBOR exposure on a portion of our Senior Secured Term Loan or similar replacement debt. The tranche commenced on December 31, 2021, and expires on December 31, 2026, with a current aggregate notional amount of $1,600.0 million that amortizes each quarter. The tranche requires TransUnion to pay fixed rates varying between 1.428% and 1.4360% in exchange for receiving a variable rate that matches the variable rate on our loans. We have designated these swap agreements as cash flow hedges.\nOn December 17, 2021, we completed the sale of our Healthcare business. The Healthcare business met the criteria for discontinued operations at December 31, 2021, as the sale represented a strategic shift in our business that will have a major effect on our results of operations. The results of operations are classified as discontinued operations, net of tax, in our consolidated statement of income for all periods presented. Discontinued operations, net of tax, also includes a gain on the disposal of the Healthcare business of $982.5, net of tax, in the consolidated statements of income for 2021. All tables and discussions below exclude the impact of the Healthcare business.\nOn December 1, 2021, we entered into an agreement to amend certain provisions of the Senior Secured Credit Facility and exercise our right to draw additional debt in an amount of $3,100.0 million, less original issue discount and deferred financing fees of $7.8 million and $43.6 million, respectively. Proceeds from the incremental loan on the Senior Secured Credit Facility were used to finance the acquisition of Neustar.\nOn December 1, 2021, we entered into a Second Lien Credit Agreement to obtain term loans in an aggregate amount of $640.0 million (the Second Lien Term Loan\u201d), less original issue discount and deferred financing fees of $3.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively, used to fund the acquisition of Sontiq. On December 23, 2021, we fully repaid the Second Lien Term Loan using a portion of the proceeds from our sale of the Healthcare business. As a result of the prepayment, we expensed the unamortized original issue discount and deferred fees to other income and expense in the consolidated statement of income.\nIn March 2021, we prepaid $85.0 million of our Senior Secured Term Loans, funded from our cash on hand. In December 2020,\nwe prepaid $150.0 million of our Senior Secured Term Loans, funded from our cash on hand.\nOn March 10, 2020, we entered into two tranches of interest rate swap agreements with various counter-parties that effectively fix our LIBOR exposure on a portion of our Senior Secured Term Loans or similar replacement debt. The first tranche commenced on June 30, 2020, and expires on June 30, 2022, with a current aggregate notional amount of $1,120.0 million that amortizes each quarter. The first tranche requires TransUnion to pay fixed rates varying between 0.5200% and 0.5295% in exchange for receiving a variable rate that matches the variable rate on our loans. The second tranche commences on June 30, 2022, and expires on June 30, 2025, with an initial aggregate notional amount of $1,110.0 million that amortizes each quarter after it commences. The second tranche requires TransUnion to pay fixed rates varying between 0.9125% and 0.9280% in exchange for receiving a variable rate that matches the variable rate on our loans. We have designated these swap agreements as cash flow hedges.\nIn December 2020, we prepaid $150.0 million of our Senior Secured Term Loans, funded from our cash on hand. During 2019, we prepaid $340.0 million of our Senior Secured Term Loans, also funded from cash on hand. These transactions affect the comparability of interest expense between 2021, 2020 and 2019 as further discussed in Results of Operations - Non-Operating Income and Expense\u201d below.\nOn November 15, 2019, we refinanced our B-3 and B-4 loans with a new tranche of Senior Secured Term Loan B ( Senior Secured Term Loan B-5\u201d) which, along with cash of $9.0 million, was used to pay-off the Senior Secured Term Loan B-3 and Senior Secured Term Loan B-4 loans. On December 10, 2019, we refinanced our A-2 loan with a new tranche of Senior Secured Term Loan A ( Senior Secured Term Loan A-3\u201d), which was used to pay-off our existing Senior Secured Term Loan A-2 loans. With this refinance, we also converted the existing Senior Secured Revolving Line of Credit into a new Senior Secured Revolving Line of Credit.\nRecent Acquisitions\nWe selectively evaluate acquisitions as a means to expand our business and to enter new markets. Since January 1, 2019, we have completed the following acquisitions, including those that impact the comparability of our results between periods:\n\u2022On December 1, 2021, we acquired 100% of the equity of Neustar.

We present Adjusted Revenue as a supplemental measure of revenue because we believe it provides a basis to compare revenue between periods. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we no longer have these adjustments to revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to TransUnion plus (less) loss (income) from discontinued operations, net of tax plus net interest expense, plus (less) provision (benefit) for income taxes, plus depreciation and amortization, plus (less) the revenue adjustments included in Adjusted Revenue, plus stock-based compensation, plus mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and business optimization-related expenses including Neustar and Callcredit integration-related expenses, plus certain accelerated technology investment expenses to migrate to the cloud, plus (less) certain other expenses (income).\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our operating performance because it eliminates the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our cash operations and ongoing operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also a measure frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies similar to ours. Our board of directors and executive management team use Adjusted EBITDA as a compensation measure under our incentive compensation plan. Under the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility, our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments and paying dividends is tied to a ratio based on Adjusted EBITDA. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt.\u201d Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our capital expenditures, interest, income tax, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and certain other income and expense. Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial condition or profitability under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to operating income or net income as indicators of operating performance. We believe that the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss) attributable to TransUnion. The table above provides a reconciliation from our net income (loss) attributable to TransUnion to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nRevenue\nAs mentioned above, the effects of COVID-19 impact the comparability of revenue between periods for all discussions below.\nFor 2021, revenue increased $429.6 million compared with 2020, due primarily to improving macroeconomic conditions in all of our markets, revenue from new product initiatives, revenue from our recent acquisitions in the U.S. Markets and Consumer Interactive segments, and an increase of 1.1% increase from the impact of strengthening foreign currencies.\nFor 2020, revenue increased $67.4 million compared with 2019, due primarily to organic growth in the Financial Services vertical in the U.S. Markets segment, the Consumer Interactive segment, and the Canada region in the International segment, revenue from recent acquisitions in U.S. Markets Emerging Verticals, and revenue from new product initiatives, partially offset by a decrease in organic revenue in U.S. Markets Emerging Verticals and the other regions of the International segment, and a 0.9% decrease from the impact of weakening foreign currencies.\nRevenue by segment and a more detailed explanation of revenue within each segment are as follows:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

and\n\u2022the impact of weakening foreign currencies on the expenses of our International segment.\nFor 2020, Adjusted EBITDA margins for the U.S. Markets segment decreased due primarily to the impact of COVID-19 on revenue in Emerging Verticals, an increase in expense for certain legal and regulatory matters and an increase in labor costs primarily due to key strategic growth initiatives, partially offset by improving market conditions in the mortgage line of business in the Financial Services Vertical and a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins for the International segment decreased due primarily to the impact of COVID-19 on revenue, partially offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses and the impact of weakening foreign currencies on the expenses of our International segment.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins for the Consumer Interactive segment decreased due primarily to an increase in advertising costs and variable product costs, partially offset by an increase in revenue.\nNon-Operating Income and (Expense)\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve months ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(112.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(126.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(173.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from equity method investments </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and (expense), net: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition fees </td> <td>(48.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>nm </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>nm </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan fees </td> <td>(19.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>nm </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net </td> <td>18.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(90.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income and expense, net </td> <td>(49.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>nm </td> <td> </td> <td>15.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>nm </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating income and expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(146.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(110.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(167.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nnm: not meaningful\nAs a result of displaying amounts in millions, rounding differences may exist in the table above.\nInterest expense\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, interest expense decreased $13.7 million compared with 2020. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, interest expense decreased $47.5 million compared with 2019. The decrease in interest expense for both periods is due primarily to the impact of a decrease in our average interest rate and a decrease in our average outstanding principal balance, and in 2021, partially offset by expenses attributable new borrowings and early prepayments late in the year as described in further detail below.\nIn December 2019, we refinanced our Senior Secured Credit Facility which decreased our average interest rate in 2020 and 2021. Further, we prepaid $340.0 million, $150.0 million and $85.0 million of our Senior Secured Term Loans in the second half of 2019, in 2020, and in 2021, respectively. These prepayments decreased our average outstanding principal balance in each subsequent period.\nOn December 1, 2021, we borrowed $3,100.0 of additional debt under our Senior Secured Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of Neustar. In addition, on December 1, 2021, we entered into a Second Lien Credit Agreement to obtain term loans in an aggregate amount of $640.0 million (the Second Lien Term Loan\u201d) which was used to fund the acquisition of Sontiq. On December 23, 2021, we fully repaid the Second Lien Term Loan using a portion of the proceeds from our sale of the Healthcare business.\nThese factors impact the comparability of interest expense between periods. Our future interest expense could be materially impacted by changes in our variable interest rates to the extent our variable rate debt is not hedged with fixed rate debt, additional borrowings, or additional prepayments. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt,\u201d for additional information about our debt.\nAcquisition fees\nAcquisition fees represent costs we have incurred for various acquisition-related efforts, and include costs related to our acquisitions of Neustar and Sontiq in 2021, Tru Optik and Signal Digital in 2020, and TruSignal in 2019, as well as costs of our other acquisition efforts. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 2, Business Acquisitions,\u201d for additional information about our acquisition-related efforts.\nLoan fees\nFor 2021, loan fees included $17.9 million of financing fees and other net costs expensed as a result of our repayment of our Second Lien Term Loan and the partial repayment of our other Term Loans. For 2020, loan fees were not significant. For 2019, loan fees included, among other things, $13.0 million of refinancing fees and other net costs expensed as a result of refinancing our Senior Secured Term Loan late in 2019. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt,\u201d for additional information about our debt.\nOther income (expense), net includes currency remeasurement gains and losses, dividends received from cost method investments, gains and losses on Cost Method investments, if any, and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expense items, including recoveries from the Fraud Incident.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor 2021, we reported a 26.1% effective tax rate, which is higher than the 21.0% U.S. federal corporate statutory rate due primarily to recording tax expense related to the remeasurement of our U.K. deferred taxes to reflect an increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate enacted in the second quarter 2021 and nondeductible transaction costs and penalties, partially offset by excess tax benefits on stock based compensation and a tax benefit related to electing the Global Intangible Low Tax Income ( GILTI\u201d) high-tax exclusion retroactively for the 2018 and 2019 tax years. On July 20, 2020, the U.S. Treasury issued and enacted final regulations related to GILTI that allow certain U.S. taxpayers to elect to exclude foreign income that is subject to a high effective tax rate from their GILTI inclusions. The GILTI high-tax exclusion is an annual election and is retroactively available.\nFor 2020, we reported a 21.5% effective tax rate, which is higher than the 21.0% U.S. federal corporate statutory rate due primarily to an increase in state taxes, valuation allowances on foreign tax credit carryforwards, and uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties, partially offset by excess tax benefits on stock based compensation and foreign taxes in jurisdictions which have tax rates lower than the U.S. federal corporate statutory rate.\nFor 2019, we reported a 18.8% effective tax rate, which is lower than the 21.0% U.S. federal corporate statutory rate due primarily to excess tax benefits on stock based compensation, partially offset by U.S. federal tax on foreign earnings and foreign taxes in jurisdictions which have tax rates that are higher than the U.S. federal corporate statutory rate. We also changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion on our unremitted foreign earnings during the fourth quarter 2019, such that management intends to repatriate current year foreign earnings, net of working capital requirements, and indefinitely reinvest prior years' foreign earnings. The change in assertion had an immaterial impact on the current year effective tax rate.\nSignificant Changes in Assets and Liabilities\nTotal goodwill and intangibles at December 31, 2021 increased compared with December 31, 2020, due primarily to the acquisitions of Sontiq and Neustar. See Recent Transactions\u201d above and Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 2, Business Acquisitions\u201d for additional information.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents increased due primarily to proceeds received from the disposal of our Healthcare business in December, 2021. See Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 3, Discontinued Operations,\u201d for additional information. A portion of the proceeds from the disposal of our Healthcare business were used to fully repay the Second Lien Term Loan obtained to finance the acquisition of Sontiq. See Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt,\u201d for additional information.\nTotal debt at December 31, 2021 increased due to additional financings in connection with these acquisitions. See Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt,\u201d for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, and our senior secured revolving line of credit. Our principal uses of liquidity are working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other capital structure obligations, business acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. We believe our cash on hand, cash generated from operations, and funds available under the senior secured revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures, debt service and other capital structure obligations, business acquisitions and operating needs for the foreseeable future. Our ability to maintain adequate liquidity for our operations in the future is dependent upon a number of factors, including our revenue, macroeconomic conditions, our ability to contain costs, including capital expenditures, and to collect accounts receivable, and various other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We will continue to monitor our liquidity position and may elect to raise funds through debt or equity financing in the future to fund operations, significant investments or acquisitions that are consistent with our growth strategy\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $1,842.4 million and $492.7 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of which $205.0 million and $232.0 million were held outside the United States. As of December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding balance under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and $0.1 million of outstanding letters of credit, and could have borrowed up to the remaining $299.9 million available.\nWe also have the ability to request incremental loans on the same terms under the existing senior secured credit facility up to the greater of an additional $1,000.0 million and 100% of Consolidated EBITDA. In addition, so long as the senior secured net leverage ratio does not exceed 4.25-to-1, we may incur additional incremental loans, subject to certain additional conditions and commitments by existing or new lenders to fund any additional borrowings.\nWith certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Credit Facility obligations are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Trans Union LLC, including its investments in subsidiaries. The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains various restrictions and nonfinancial covenants, along with a senior secured net leverage ratio test. The nonfinancial covenants include restrictions on dividends, investments, dispositions, future borrowings and other specified payments, as well as additional reporting and disclosure requirements. The senior secured net leverage test must be met as a condition to incur additional indebtedness, make certain investments, and may be required to make certain restricted payments. The senior secured net leverage ratio must not exceed 5.5-to-1 at any such measurement date.\nOn January 31, 2022, we prepaid $400 million of our Senior Secured Term Loans, funded from our cash on hand. The remaining balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is consistent with our short-term cash needs and investment objectives.\nIn April 2022, we are expected to pay approximately $352 million of income taxes related to the gain on the sale of our Healthcare business.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, we expect to close on the announced agreement to acquire Verisk Financial Services, including Argus Information and Advisory Services, and pay the approximate $515 million purchase price. We intend to fund the acquisition through cash on hand. For additional information on this transaction, see Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 25, Subsequent Events.\u201d\nThe Company may be required to make additional principal payments on the Senior Secured Term Loan B based on excess cash flows of the prior year, as defined in the agreement. There were no excess cash flows for 2021 and therefore no additional payment will be required in 2022. Additional payments based on excess cash flows could be due in future years. See Part II,\nItem 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt,\u201d for additional information about our debt.\nDuring 2021 and 2020, we prepaid $85.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, towards our Senior Secured Term Loans, funded from our cash on hand.\nDuring 2021, the board of directors declared one quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share and three quarterly dividends of $0.095 per share, of which we paid $69.8 million. During 2020, the board of directors declared four quarterly dividends of $0.075 per share, of which we paid $57.6 million.\nAny determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. We currently have capacity and intend to continue to pay a quarterly dividend, subject to approval by our board.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, 1.2 million, outstanding employee restricted stock units vested and became taxable to the employees. Employees satisfy their payroll tax withholding obligations in a net share settlement arrangement. We remitted cash to the respective governmental agencies equivalent to the value of the shares employees used to satisfy their withholding obligations of $36.8 million. There will be a similar cash remittance in February 2022.\nOn February 13, 2017, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0 million of our common stock over the next 3 years. Our board of directors removed the three-year time limitation on February 8, 2018. To date, we have repurchased $133.5 million of our common stock and have the ability to repurchase the remaining $166.5 million.\nWe have no obligation to repurchase additional shares, and the timing, actual number and value of the shares that are repurchased, if any, will be at the discretion of management and will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, the cost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, liquidity, and other factors deemed appropriate. Repurchases may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason. Any repurchased shares will have the status of treasury shares and may be used, if and when needed, for general corporate purposes.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve months ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>808.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>787.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>776.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities </td> <td>(2,212.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(267.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(203.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,945.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(63.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in) financing activities </td> <td>2,762.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(296.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(484.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,059.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>187.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>(8.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,349.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>219.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,130.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nFor 2021, the increase in cash provided by continuing operations was due primarily to an increase in operating performance and a decrease in interest expense, partially offset by an increase in working capital. For 2020, the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to a decrease in interest expense and a decrease in working capital, partially offset by a decrease in operating performance as a result of COVID-19.\nInvesting Activities\nFor 2021, the increase in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to the acquisitions of Neustar and Sontiq, various investments in nonconsolidated affiliates, and an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of our Healthcare business. For 2020, the increase in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to proceeds from the disposal of discontinued operations in 2019 that did not recur in 2020, an increase in cash used for acquisitions and an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of investments in 2020.\nFinancing Activities\nFor 2021, The increase in cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to debt proceeds used to fund the Neustar and Sontiq acquisitions, partially offset by the repayment of the debt from a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of our Healthcare business and increased debt financing fees. For 2020, the decrease in cash used in financing activities was due primarily to a decrease in debt prepayments, $150 million in 2020 compared with $340 million in 2019.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe make capital expenditures to grow our business by developing new and enhanced capabilities, to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the organization and to reduce risks. We make capital expenditures for product development, disaster recovery, security enhancements, regulatory compliance, and the replacement and upgrade of existing equipment at the end of its useful life.\nFor 2021, cash paid for capital expenditures increased $18.6 million to $224.2 million. For 2020, cash paid for capital expenditures increased $17.2 million to $205.6 million.\nDebt\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nOn June 15, 2010, we entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facility with various lenders. This facility has been amended several times and currently consists of the Senior Secured Term Loan B-6, Senior Secured Term Loan B-5, Senior Secured Term Loan A-3 (collectively, the Senior Secured Term Loans\u201d), and the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn December 1, 2021, we entered into an agreement to amend certain provisions of the Senior Secured Credit Facility and exercise our right to draw additional debt in an amount of $3,100.0 million, less original issue discount and deferred financing fees of $7.8 million and $43.6 million, respectively. Proceeds from the incremental loan on the Senior Secured Credit Facility were used to fund the acquisition of Neustar.\nIn addition, on December 1, 2021, we entered into a Second Lien Credit Agreement to obtain term loans in an aggregate amount of $640.0 million, less original issue discount and deferred financing fees of $3.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively, used for the acquisition of Sontiq. On December 23, 2021, we fully repaid the Second Lien Term Loan using a portion of the proceeds from our sale of the Healthcare business.\nHedges\nOn December 23, 2021, we entered into new interest rate swap agreements with various counter-parties that effectively fix our LIBOR exposure on a portion of our Senior Secured Term Loan or similar replacement debt. The new swaps commenced on December 31, 2021, and expires on December 31, 2026, with a current aggregate notional amount of $1,600.0 million that amortizes each quarter. The new swaps require TransUnion to pay fixed rates varying between 1.4280% and 1.4360% in exchange for receiving a variable rate that matches the variable rate on our loans. We have designated these swap agreements as cash flow hedges.\nOn March 10, 2020, we entered into two tranches of interest rate swap agreements with various counter-parties that effectively fix our LIBOR exposure on a portion of our Senior Secured Term Loans or similar replacement debt. The first swap commenced on June 30, 2020, and expires on June 30, 2022, with a current aggregate notional amount of $1,120.0 million that amortizes each quarter. The first swap requires TransUnion to pay fixed rates varying between 0.5200% and 0.5295% in exchange for receiving a variable rate that matches the variable rate on our loans. The second swap commences on June 30, 2022, and expires on June 30, 2025, with a current aggregate notional amount of $1,110.0 million that amortizes each quarter after it commences. The second swap requires TransUnion to pay fixed rates varying between 0.9125% and 0.9280% in exchange for receiving a variable rate that matches the variable rate on our loans. We have designated these swap agreements as cash flow hedges.\nOn December 17, 2018, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with various counter-parties that effectively fix our LIBOR exposure on a portion of our Senior Secured Term Loans or similar replacement debt, which is currently fixed at 2.702% and 2.706%. We have designated these swap agreements as cash flow hedges. The current aggregate notional amount under these agreements is $1,390.0 million, decreasing each quarter until the second agreement terminates on December 30, 2022.\nEffect of certain debt covenants\nA breach of any of the covenants under the agreements governing our debt could limit our ability to borrow funds under the senior secured revolving line of credit and could result in a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior secured credit facility, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding to be immediately due and payable, and the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay the amounts declared due, the lenders could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.\nWith certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Credit Facility obligations are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Trans Union LLC, including its investment in subsidiaries. The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains various restrictions and nonfinancial covenants, along with a senior secured net leverage ratio test. The nonfinancial covenants include restrictions on dividends, investments, dispositions, future borrowings and other specified payments, as well\nas additional reporting and disclosure requirements. The senior secured net leverage test must be met as a condition to incur additional indebtedness, make certain investments, and may be required to make certain restricted payments. The senior secured net leverage ratio must not exceed 5.5-to-1 at any such measurement date. Under the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, TransUnion may make dividend payments up to the greater of $100 million or 10.0% of Consolidated EBITDA per year, or an unlimited amount provided that no default or event of default exists and so long as the total net leverage ratio does not exceed 4.75-to-1. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nOur ability to meet our liquidity needs or to pay dividends on our common stock depends on our subsidiaries' earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, and other contractual restrictions.\nFor additional information about our debt and hedge, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt.\u201d\nContractual Obligations\nRefer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt,\u201d Note 13, Leases\u201d and Note 21, Commitments,\u201d for information about our long-term debt obligations, noncancelable lease obligations, and noncancelable purchase obligations as of December 31, 2021.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d Note 1, Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies,\u201d for additional information about our significant accounting and reporting policies that require us to make certain judgements and estimates in reporting our operating results and our assets and liabilities. The following paragraphs describe the accounting policies that require significant judgment and estimates due to inherent uncertainty or complexity.\nGoodwill\nAs of December 31, 2021, our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $5,525.7 million. As of December 31, 2021, we did not have any other indefinite-lived intangible assets. We conduct an impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired.\nWe have the option to first perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the qualitative analysis indicates that an impairment is more likely than not for any reporting unit, we perform a quantitative impairment analysis for that reporting unit. We have the option to bypass the qualitative analysis for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing a quantitative analysis.\nOur quantitative analysis consists of a fair value calculation for each reporting unit that combines an income approach, using the discounted cash flow method, and a market approach, using the guideline public company method. The quantitative impairment analysis requires the application of a number of significant assumptions, including estimates of future revenue growth rates, EBITDA margins, discount rates, and market multiples. The projected future revenue and EBITDA margins, and the resulting projected cash flows of each reporting unit is based on internal operating plans reviewed by management, extrapolated over the forecast period. The discount rate for each reporting unit is based on the weighted average cost of capital for the reporting unit. Market multiples are based on the Guideline Public Company Method using comparable publicly traded company multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization for a group of benchmark companies.\nWe believe the assumptions we use in our qualitative and quantitative analysis are reasonable and consistent with assumptions that would be used by other marketplace participants. In order to ensure the assumptions used in the analysis are reasonable, we compare the sum of the fair value of the reporting units to our market capitalization, to ensure it is within a reasonable range. However, such assumptions are inherently uncertain, and a change in assumptions could change the estimated fair values of our reporting units and, therefore, future impairment charges could be required, which could be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2021, we elected to bypass the qualitative goodwill impairment analysis, and instead performed a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for all reporting units. For each of our reporting units, the fair value exceeded the carrying value and no impairment was recorded. Further, a 10% decrease in the estimated cash flows or a 10% increase in the discount rate, combined with a 10% decrease in the market multiple would not result in an impairment for any of our reporting units. Our reporting units that have longer operating histories have greater headroom compared with reporting units that include significant recent acquisitions.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the acquisitions of Neustar for $3,106.6 million in cash, subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments, and Sontiq for $642.8 million in cash, subject to certain customary purchase price\nadjustments. These transactions were accounted for as business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination generally be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The determination of fair value requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been recorded as goodwill.\nThe valuations of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have not yet been finalized as of December 31, 2021. The purchase price allocations are preliminary and subject to change, including the valuation of intangible assets, income taxes and goodwill, among other items. The fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 31, 2021 are based on management's best estimates and assumptions as of the reporting date.\nIn determining the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets, we utilized various forms of the income approach, depending on the asset being valued. The estimation of fair value requires significant judgment related to cash flow forecasts, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in each cash flow stream, competitive trends, market comparables and other factors. Other inputs included historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, and growth rates.\nThe intangible assets were valued using the following valuation approaches:\nCustomer Relationships\nWe valued customer relationships using the multi-period excess-earnings method, a form of the income approach, which required the application of judgment for significant assumptions. Significant assumptions include customer attrition rates, EBITDA margins, and discount rates.\nTechnology and software\nWe valued the developed technology using the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach, which required the application of judgment for significant assumptions. Significant assumptions include the royalty rate, economic depreciation factors, and discount rates.\nOther identifiable intangible assets\nOther identifiable intangible assets include trade names and trademarks and non-compete agreements for key employees, which are not material. Trade names and trademarks were valued using the relief from royalty method and non-compete agreements were valued using the lost income method.\nWe engaged a third-party valuation specialist to assist in our analysis of the fair value of the acquired intangibles. All judgements, significant assumptions and estimates, and forecasts were either provided by or reviewed by us. While we chose to utilize a third-party valuation specialist for assistance, the fair value analysis and related valuations reflect the conclusions of management and not those of any third party. We believe the judgements and assumptions we have used are reasonable and consistent with assumptions that would be used by other marketplace participants. However such assumptions are inherently uncertain, and a change in assumptions could change the estimated fair values of the intangible assets which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are routinely named as defendants in, or parties to, various legal actions and proceedings relating to our current or past business operations. These actions generally assert claims for violations of federal or state credit reporting, consumer protection or privacy laws, or common law claims related to the unfair treatment of consumers, and may include claims for substantial or indeterminate compensatory or punitive damages, or injunctive relief, and may seek business practice changes. We believe that most of these claims are either without merit or we have valid defenses to the claims, and we vigorously defend these matters or seek non-monetary or small monetary settlements, if possible. However, due to the uncertainties inherent in litigation, we cannot predict the outcome of each claim in each instance.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we also are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal), certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. In connection with formal and informal inquiries by these regulators, we routinely receive requests, subpoenas and orders seeking documents, testimony, and other information in connection with various aspects of our activities.\nIn view of the inherent unpredictability of legal and regulatory matters, particularly where the damages sought are substantial or indeterminate or when the proceedings or investigations are in the early stages, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty the timing or ultimate resolution of legal and regulatory matters or the eventual loss, fines or penalties, if any, that may result. We establish reserves for legal and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and can be reasonably estimated. However, for certain of the matters, we are not able to reasonably estimate our exposure because damages have not been specified and (i) the proceedings are in early stages, (ii) there is uncertainty as to the\nlikelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (iii) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of similar matters pending against our competitors, (iv) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (v) there are legal issues of a first impression being presented. The actual costs of resolving legal and regulatory matters, however, may be substantially higher than the amounts reserved for those matters, and an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in particular quarterly or annual periods. We accrue amounts for certain legal and regulatory matters for which losses were considered to be probable of occurring based on our best estimate of the most likely outcome. It is reasonably possible actual losses could be significantly different from our current estimates. In addition, there are some matters for which it is reasonably possible that a loss will occur, however we cannot estimate a range of the potential losses for these matters. Legal fees incurred in connection with ongoing litigation are considered a period cost and are expensed as incurred.\nTo reduce our exposure to an unexpected significant monetary award resulting from an adverse judicial decision, we maintain insurance that we believe is appropriate and adequate based on our historical experience. We regularly advise our insurance carriers of the claims (threatened or pending) against us in the course of litigation and generally receive a reservation of rights letter from the carriers when such claims exceed applicable deductibles. We are not aware of any significant monetary claim that has been asserted against us in the course of pending litigation that would not have some level of coverage by insurance after the relevant deductible, if any, is met.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we accrued $85.6 million and $76.0 million, respectively, for anticipated claims. These amounts were recorded in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and the associated expenses were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Legal fees incurred in connection with ongoing litigation are considered period costs and are expensed as incurred.\nSee Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 22, Contingencies,\u201d for further information.\nIncome Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2021, our consolidated balance sheet included non-current deferred tax liabilities of $787.6 million. Certain deferred tax assets, including net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards, may be deducted from future taxable income in computing our federal income tax liability. Our deferred tax liability includes deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, temporary differences, and unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions.\nWe have made certain judgments and estimates to determine various tax amounts recorded, including future tax rates, future taxable income, whether it is more likely than not a tax position will be sustained, and the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit to record. We have deferred tax assets related to loss and credit carryforwards of $169.0 million, net of valuation allowances of $70.8 million. Our estimate of the amount of the deferred tax asset we can realize requires significant assumptions about projected revenues and income that are impacted by future market and economic conditions. We believe the judgments and estimates used are reasonable, but events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of tax audits may differ significantly from what is expected.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information about recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 1, Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies.\u201d", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of TransUnion's financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Information,\u201d including TransUnion's audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.

These businesses use our services to acquire customers, assess consumers' ability to pay for services, identify cross-selling opportunities, measure and manage debt portfolio risk, collect debt, verify consumer identities and mitigate fraud risk. The core capabilities and delivery methods in our U.S. Markets segment allow us to serve a broad set of customers across industries. We report disaggregated revenue of our U.S. Markets segment for Financial Services and Emerging Verticals. The results of operations of Neustar are included in the Emerging Verticals and our consolidated statements of income since the date of the acquisition.\nInternational\nThe International segment provides services similar to our U.S. Markets segment to businesses in select regions outside the United States. Depending on the maturity of the credit economy in each country, services may include credit reports, analytics and technology solutions services, and other value-added risk management services. We also have insurance, business and automotive databases in select geographies. These services are offered to customers in a number of industries including financial services, retail credit, insurance, automotive, collections, public sector, and communications, and are delivered through both direct and indirect channels. The International segment also provides consumer services similar to those offered by our Consumer Interactive segment that help consumers proactively manage their personal finances.\nWe report disaggregated revenue of our International segment for the following regions: Canada, Latin America, the United Kingdom, Africa, India, and Asia Pacific.\nConsumer Interactive\nThe Consumer Interactive segment offers solutions that help consumers manage their personal finances and take precautions against identity theft. Services in this segment include credit reports and scores, credit monitoring, identity protection and resolution, and financial management for consumers. The segment also provides solutions that help businesses respond to data breach events. Our products are provided through user-friendly online and mobile interfaces and are supported by educational content and customer support. Our Consumer Interactive segment serves consumers through both direct and indirect channels. The results of operations of Sontiq are included in the Consumer Interactive segment and our consolidated statements of income since the date of the acquisition.\nCorporate\nIn addition, Corporate provides support services for each of the segments, holds investments, and conducts enterprise functions. Certain costs incurred in Corporate that are not directly attributable to one or more of the segments remain in Corporate. These costs are typically enterprise-level costs and are primarily administrative in nature.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nThe following are certain key factors that affect, or have recently affected, our results of operations:\nMacroeconomic and Industry Trends, Including the Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Business and Results of Operations\nOur revenues can be significantly influenced by general macroeconomic conditions, including the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of credit and capital, interest rates, inflation, employment levels, consumer confidence and housing demand. During 2020, the economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic had a material and adverse impact on numerous aspects of our business, including our results of operations in all of the markets where we operate. During 2021, we saw steady improvements in our results of operations in all these markets. This dynamic impacts the comparability of our results of operations, including our revenue and expenses, for each of the periods presented below. Also, given ongoing uncertainty and the unpredictable nature of the pandemic, including the rise of variants of the virus and the effectiveness of vaccines against those variants, COVID-19 may have a material and adverse impact on various aspects of our business in the future, including our results of operations.\nIn the markets where we compete, we have seen generally improving macroeconomic conditions since the second quarter of 2020. In the United States, we saw strong and improving macroeconomic conditions throughout 2021, including strong gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) growth, falling unemployment rates, and mortgage interest rates that are still near historic lows, all of which are evident in the significantly improved 2021 results of all of our segments. During 2021, we saw similar improvements in our international markets, although in certain of these markets there remains higher ongoing concerns about the impact of COVID-19. These macroeconomic improvements are evident in our 2021 results of operations, with all of our segments showing ongoing signs of improvements compared with last year.\nWhile we believe that a strong but slowing global GDP growth is expected for the coming year, such expectations are tempered by increasing concerns around rising inflation, geopolitical tensions and existing and new coronavirus variants, as well as waning consumer confidence, interest rate pressures and increasing supply chain and ongoing labor shortage concerns. Also, in certain of our markets, there remains concern regarding the impact COVID-19 could have on our business.\nEffects of Inflation\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. The impact of recent and expected future inflation increases could have a significant negative impact on our business, including decreased demand for our services as a result of rising interest rates.\nRecent Developments\nThe following developments impact the comparability of our balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows between years:\nOn January 24, 2022, we reached a tentative class settlement with the plaintiffs in Ramirez v. Trans Union LLC ( Ramirez\u201d or the Ramirez Litigation\u201d), which will require court approval. We expect this matter to be resolved by the end of 2022. Accordingly, in 2021, we revised the amount of the probable loss that we previously estimated, resulting in a reduction of our estimated liability and partially offsetting insurance receivable, and a corresponding net reduction recorded in selling, general and administrative expense for the year end December 31, 2021. See Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 22, Contingencies\u201d for additional information.\nDuring 2020, the economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic had a material and adverse impact on numerous aspects of our business, including the results of operations in all of our segments. During 2021, we saw ongoing improvements in our results of operations in all of the markets where we operate. This dynamic impacts the comparability of our results of operations between all of the periods presented below.\nOn December 23, 2021, we entered into a tranche of interest rate swap agreements with various counter-parties that effectively fix our LIBOR exposure on a portion of our Senior Secured Term Loan or similar replacement debt. The tranche commenced on December 31, 2021, and expires on December 31, 2026, with a current aggregate notional amount of $1,600.0 million that amortizes each quarter. The tranche requires TransUnion to pay fixed rates varying between 1.428% and 1.4360% in exchange for receiving a variable rate that matches the variable rate on our loans. We have designated these swap agreements as cash flow hedges.\nOn December 17, 2021, we completed the sale of our Healthcare business. The Healthcare business met the criteria for discontinued operations at December 31, 2021, as the sale represented a strategic shift in our business that will have a major effect on our results of operations. The results of operations are classified as discontinued operations, net of tax, in our consolidated statement of income for all periods presented. Discontinued operations, net of tax, also includes a gain on the disposal of the Healthcare business of $982.5, net of tax, in the consolidated statements of income for 2021. All tables and discussions below exclude the impact of the Healthcare business.\nOn December 1, 2021, we entered into an agreement to amend certain provisions of the Senior Secured Credit Facility and exercise our right to draw additional debt in an amount of $3,100.0 million, less original issue discount and deferred financing fees of $7.8 million and $43.6 million, respectively. Proceeds from the incremental loan on the Senior Secured Credit Facility were used to finance the acquisition of Neustar.\nOn December 1, 2021, we entered into a Second Lien Credit Agreement to obtain term loans in an aggregate amount of $640.0 million (the Second Lien Term Loan\u201d), less original issue discount and deferred financing fees of $3.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively, used to fund the acquisition of Sontiq. On December 23, 2021, we fully repaid the Second Lien Term Loan using a portion of the proceeds from our sale of the Healthcare business. As a result of the prepayment, we expensed the unamortized original issue discount and deferred fees to other income and expense in the consolidated statement of income.\nIn March 2021, we prepaid $85.0 million of our Senior Secured Term Loans, funded from our cash on hand. In December 2020,\nwe prepaid $150.0 million of our Senior Secured Term Loans, funded from our cash on hand.\nOn March 10, 2020, we entered into two tranches of interest rate swap agreements with various counter-parties that effectively fix our LIBOR exposure on a portion of our Senior Secured Term Loans or similar replacement debt. The first tranche commenced on June 30, 2020, and expires on June 30, 2022, with a current aggregate notional amount of $1,120.0 million that amortizes each quarter. The first tranche requires TransUnion to pay fixed rates varying between 0.5200% and 0.5295% in exchange for receiving a variable rate that matches the variable rate on our loans. The second tranche commences on June 30, 2022, and expires on June 30, 2025, with an initial aggregate notional amount of $1,110.0 million that amortizes each quarter after it commences. The second tranche requires TransUnion to pay fixed rates varying between 0.9125% and 0.9280% in exchange for receiving a variable rate that matches the variable rate on our loans. We have designated these swap agreements as cash flow hedges.\nIn December 2020, we prepaid $150.0 million of our Senior Secured Term Loans, funded from our cash on hand. During 2019, we prepaid $340.0 million of our Senior Secured Term Loans, also funded from cash on hand. These transactions affect the comparability of interest expense between 2021, 2020 and 2019 as further discussed in Results of Operations - Non-Operating Income and Expense\u201d below.\nOn November 15, 2019, we refinanced our B-3 and B-4 loans with a new tranche of Senior Secured Term Loan B ( Senior Secured Term Loan B-5\u201d) which, along with cash of $9.0 million, was used to pay-off the Senior Secured Term Loan B-3 and Senior Secured Term Loan B-4 loans. On December 10, 2019, we refinanced our A-2 loan with a new tranche of Senior Secured Term Loan A ( Senior Secured Term Loan A-3\u201d), which was used to pay-off our existing Senior Secured Term Loan A-2 loans. With this refinance, we also converted the existing Senior Secured Revolving Line of Credit into a new Senior Secured Revolving Line of Credit.\nRecent Acquisitions\nWe selectively evaluate acquisitions as a means to expand our business and to enter new markets. Since January 1, 2019, we have completed the following acquisitions, including those that impact the comparability of our results between periods:\n\u2022On December 1, 2021, we acquired 100% of the equity of Neustar. Neustar, a premier identity resolution company with leading solutions in Marketing, Risk and Communications, enables customers to build connected consumer experiences by combining decision analytics with real-time identity resolution services driven by its OneID platform.

We present Adjusted Revenue as a supplemental measure of revenue because we believe it provides a basis to compare revenue between periods. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we no longer have these adjustments to revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to TransUnion plus (less) loss (income) from discontinued operations, net of tax plus net interest expense, plus (less) provision (benefit) for income taxes, plus depreciation and amortization, plus (less) the revenue adjustments included in Adjusted Revenue, plus stock-based compensation, plus mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and business optimization-related expenses including Neustar and Callcredit integration-related expenses, plus certain accelerated technology investment expenses to migrate to the cloud, plus (less) certain other expenses (income).\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our operating performance because it eliminates the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our cash operations and ongoing operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also a measure frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies similar to ours. Our board of directors and executive management team use Adjusted EBITDA as a compensation measure under our incentive compensation plan. Under the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility, our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments and paying dividends is tied to a ratio based on Adjusted EBITDA. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt.\u201d Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our capital expenditures, interest, income tax, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and certain other income and expense. Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial condition or profitability under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to operating income or net income as indicators of operating performance. We believe that the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss) attributable to TransUnion. The table above provides a reconciliation from our net income (loss) attributable to TransUnion to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nRevenue\nAs mentioned above, the effects of COVID-19 impact the comparability of revenue between periods for all discussions below.\nFor 2021, revenue increased $429.6 million compared with 2020, due primarily to improving macroeconomic conditions in all of our markets, revenue from new product initiatives, revenue from our recent acquisitions in the U.S. Markets and Consumer Interactive segments, and an increase of 1.1% increase from the impact of strengthening foreign currencies.\nFor 2020, revenue increased $67.4 million compared with 2019, due primarily to organic growth in the Financial Services vertical in the U.S. Markets segment, the Consumer Interactive segment, and the Canada region in the International segment, revenue from recent acquisitions in U.S. Markets Emerging Verticals, and revenue from new product initiatives, partially offset by a decrease in organic revenue in U.S. Markets Emerging Verticals and the other regions of the International segment, and a 0.9% decrease from the impact of weakening foreign currencies.\nRevenue by segment and a more detailed explanation of revenue within each segment are as follows:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

beginning of our discussion about our Results of Operations. See the Revenue\u201d table above for details of the intersegment revenue eliminations by segment. Segment Adjusted EBITDA margins are calculated using segment gross Adjusted Revenue and segment Adjusted EBITDA. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated using consolidated Adjusted Revenue and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA.\nFor 2021, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA increased $203.2 million due primarily to:\n\u2022an increase in revenue from improving macroeconomic conditions in all of our markets;\n\u2022a decrease in costs for certain legal and regulatory matters; and\n\u2022a decrease in bad debt expense, as we have reversed reserves that were recorded at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic,\npartially offset by:\n\u2022an increase in labor costs across all segments and Corporate, including an increase in incentive compensation due to improved performance;\n\u2022operating and integration-related costs from our recent acquisitions in our U.S. Markets and Consumer Interactive segments;\n\u2022an increase in product costs resulting from the increase in revenue in all of our segments;\nFor 2021, Adjusted EBITDA margins for the U.S. Markets segment increased due primarily to an increase in revenue and improving market conditions in both of our verticals and a decrease in bad debt expense, partially offset by an increase in product costs resulting from the increase in revenue and an increase in incentive compensation due to improved performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins for the International segment increased due primarily to an increase in revenue and improving market conditions in all of our regions and a decrease in bad debt expense, partially offset by an increase in product costs resulting from the increase in revenue and an increase in incentive compensation due to improved performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins for the Consumer Interactive were relatively consistent compared to 2020.\nFor 2020, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA decreased $12.3 million due primarily to:\n\u2022an increase in expense for certain legal and regulatory matters;\n\u2022a decrease in revenue in our International segment;\n\u2022an increase in labor costs in our U.S. Markets segment, as we invested in key strategic growth initiatives;\n\u2022an increase in product costs in our U.S. Markets and Consumer Interactive segments; and\n\u2022an increase in advertising costs in our Consumer Interactive segment,\npartially offset by:\n\u2022an increase in revenue in our U.S. Markets and Consumer Interactive segments;\n\u2022a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses due to travel restrictions and shelter in place orders related to COVID-19; and\n\u2022the impact of weakening foreign currencies on the expenses of our International segment.\nFor 2020, Adjusted EBITDA margins for the U.S. Markets segment decreased due primarily to the impact of COVID-19 on revenue in Emerging Verticals, an increase in expense for certain legal and regulatory matters and an increase in labor costs primarily due to key strategic growth initiatives, partially offset by improving market conditions in the mortgage line of business in the Financial Services Vertical and a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins for the International segment decreased due primarily to the impact of COVID-19 on revenue, partially offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses and the impact of weakening foreign currencies on the expenses of our International segment.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins for the Consumer Interactive segment decreased due primarily to an increase in advertising costs and variable product costs, partially offset by an increase in revenue.\nNon-Operating Income and (Expense)\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve months ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(112.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(126.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(173.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from equity method investments </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and (expense), net: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition fees </td> <td>(48.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>nm </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>nm </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan fees </td> <td>(19.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>nm </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net </td> <td>18.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(90.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income and expense, net </td> <td>(49.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>nm </td> <td> </td> <td>15.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>nm </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating income and expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(146.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(110.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(167.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nnm: not meaningful\nAs a result of displaying amounts in millions, rounding differences may exist in the table above.\nInterest expense\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, interest expense decreased $13.7 million compared with 2020. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, interest expense decreased $47.5 million compared with 2019. The decrease in interest expense for both periods is due primarily to the impact of a decrease in our average interest rate and a decrease in our average outstanding principal balance, and in 2021, partially offset by expenses attributable new borrowings and early prepayments late in the year as described in further detail below.\nIn December 2019, we refinanced our Senior Secured Credit Facility which decreased our average interest rate in 2020 and 2021. Further, we prepaid $340.0 million, $150.0 million and $85.0 million of our Senior Secured Term Loans in the second half of 2019, in 2020, and in 2021, respectively. These prepayments decreased our average outstanding principal balance in each subsequent period.\nOn December 1, 2021, we borrowed $3,100.0 of additional debt under our Senior Secured Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of Neustar. In addition, on December 1, 2021, we entered into a Second Lien Credit Agreement to obtain term loans in an aggregate amount of $640.0 million (the Second Lien Term Loan\u201d) which was used to fund the acquisition of Sontiq. On December 23, 2021, we fully repaid the Second Lien Term Loan using a portion of the proceeds from our sale of the Healthcare business.\nThese factors impact the comparability of interest expense between periods. Our future interest expense could be materially impacted by changes in our variable interest rates to the extent our variable rate debt is not hedged with fixed rate debt, additional borrowings, or additional prepayments. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt,\u201d for additional information about our debt.\nAcquisition fees\nAcquisition fees represent costs we have incurred for various acquisition-related efforts, and include costs related to our acquisitions of Neustar and Sontiq in 2021, Tru Optik and Signal Digital in 2020, and TruSignal in 2019, as well as costs of our other acquisition efforts. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 2, Business Acquisitions,\u201d for additional information about our acquisition-related efforts.\nLoan fees\nFor 2021, loan fees included $17.9 million of financing fees and other net costs expensed as a result of our repayment of our Second Lien Term Loan and the partial repayment of our other Term Loans. For 2020, loan fees were not significant. For 2019, loan fees included, among other things, $13.0 million of refinancing fees and other net costs expensed as a result of refinancing our Senior Secured Term Loan late in 2019. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt,\u201d for additional information about our debt.\nOther income (expense), net includes currency remeasurement gains and losses, dividends received from cost method investments, gains and losses on Cost Method investments, if any, and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expense items, including recoveries from the Fraud Incident.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor 2021, we reported a 26.1% effective tax rate, which is higher than the 21.0% U.S. federal corporate statutory rate due primarily to recording tax expense related to the remeasurement of our U.K. deferred taxes to reflect an increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate enacted in the second quarter 2021 and nondeductible transaction costs and penalties, partially offset by excess tax benefits on stock based compensation and a tax benefit related to electing the Global Intangible Low Tax Income ( GILTI\u201d) high-tax exclusion retroactively for the 2018 and 2019 tax years. On July 20, 2020, the U.S. Treasury issued and enacted final regulations related to GILTI that allow certain U.S. taxpayers to elect to exclude foreign income that is subject to a high effective tax rate from their GILTI inclusions. The GILTI high-tax exclusion is an annual election and is retroactively available.\nFor 2020, we reported a 21.5% effective tax rate, which is higher than the 21.0% U.S. federal corporate statutory rate due primarily to an increase in state taxes, valuation allowances on foreign tax credit carryforwards, and uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties, partially offset by excess tax benefits on stock based compensation and foreign taxes in jurisdictions which have tax rates lower than the U.S. federal corporate statutory rate.\nFor 2019, we reported a 18.8% effective tax rate, which is lower than the 21.0% U.S. federal corporate statutory rate due primarily to excess tax benefits on stock based compensation, partially offset by U.S. federal tax on foreign earnings and foreign taxes in jurisdictions which have tax rates that are higher than the U.S. federal corporate statutory rate. We also changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion on our unremitted foreign earnings during the fourth quarter 2019, such that management intends to repatriate current year foreign earnings, net of working capital requirements, and indefinitely reinvest prior years' foreign earnings. The change in assertion had an immaterial impact on the current year effective tax rate.\nSignificant Changes in Assets and Liabilities\nTotal goodwill and intangibles at December 31, 2021 increased compared with December 31, 2020, due primarily to the acquisitions of Sontiq and Neustar. See Recent Transactions\u201d above and Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 2, Business Acquisitions\u201d for additional information.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents increased due primarily to proceeds received from the disposal of our Healthcare business in December, 2021. See Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 3, Discontinued Operations,\u201d for additional information. A portion of the proceeds from the disposal of our Healthcare business were used to fully repay the Second Lien Term Loan obtained to finance the acquisition of Sontiq. See Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt,\u201d for additional information.\nTotal debt at December 31, 2021 increased due to additional financings in connection with these acquisitions. See Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt,\u201d for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, and our senior secured revolving line of credit. Our principal uses of liquidity are working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other capital structure obligations, business acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. We believe our cash on hand, cash generated from operations, and funds available under the senior secured revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures, debt service and other capital structure obligations, business acquisitions and operating needs for the foreseeable future. Our ability to maintain adequate liquidity for our operations in the future is dependent upon a number of factors, including our revenue, macroeconomic conditions, our ability to contain costs, including capital expenditures, and to collect accounts receivable, and various other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We will continue to monitor our liquidity position and may elect to raise funds through debt or equity financing in the future to fund operations, significant investments or acquisitions that are consistent with our growth strategy\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $1,842.4 million and $492.7 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of which $205.0 million and $232.0 million were held outside the United States. As of December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding balance under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and $0.1 million of outstanding letters of credit, and could have borrowed up to the remaining $299.9 million available.\nWe also have the ability to request incremental loans on the same terms under the existing senior secured credit facility up to the greater of an additional $1,000.0 million and 100% of Consolidated EBITDA. In addition, so long as the senior secured net leverage ratio does not exceed 4.25-to-1, we may incur additional incremental loans, subject to certain additional conditions and commitments by existing or new lenders to fund any additional borrowings.\nWith certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Credit Facility obligations are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Trans Union LLC, including its investments in subsidiaries. The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains various restrictions and nonfinancial covenants, along with a senior secured net leverage ratio test. The nonfinancial covenants include restrictions on dividends, investments, dispositions, future borrowings and other specified payments, as well as additional reporting and disclosure requirements. The senior secured net leverage test must be met as a condition to incur additional indebtedness, make certain investments, and may be required to make certain restricted payments. The senior secured net leverage ratio must not exceed 5.5-to-1 at any such measurement date.\nOn January 31, 2022, we prepaid $400 million of our Senior Secured Term Loans, funded from our cash on hand. The remaining balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is consistent with our short-term cash needs and investment objectives.\nIn April 2022, we are expected to pay approximately $352 million of income taxes related to the gain on the sale of our Healthcare business.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, we expect to close on the announced agreement to acquire Verisk Financial Services, including Argus Information and Advisory Services, and pay the approximate $515 million purchase price. We intend to fund the acquisition through cash on hand. For additional information on this transaction, see Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 25, Subsequent Events.\u201d\nThe Company may be required to make additional principal payments on the Senior Secured Term Loan B based on excess cash flows of the prior year, as defined in the agreement. There were no excess cash flows for 2021 and therefore no additional payment will be required in 2022. Additional payments based on excess cash flows could be due in future years. See Part II,\nItem 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt,\u201d for additional information about our debt.\nDuring 2021 and 2020, we prepaid $85.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, towards our Senior Secured Term Loans, funded from our cash on hand.\nDuring 2021, the board of directors declared one quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share and three quarterly dividends of $0.095 per share, of which we paid $69.8 million. During 2020, the board of directors declared four quarterly dividends of $0.075 per share, of which we paid $57.6 million.\nAny determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. We currently have capacity and intend to continue to pay a quarterly dividend, subject to approval by our board.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, 1.2 million, outstanding employee restricted stock units vested and became taxable to the employees. Employees satisfy their payroll tax withholding obligations in a net share settlement arrangement. We remitted cash to the respective governmental agencies equivalent to the value of the shares employees used to satisfy their withholding obligations of $36.8 million. There will be a similar cash remittance in February 2022.\nOn February 13, 2017, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0 million of our common stock over the next 3 years. Our board of directors removed the three-year time limitation on February 8, 2018. To date, we have repurchased $133.5 million of our common stock and have the ability to repurchase the remaining $166.5 million.\nWe have no obligation to repurchase additional shares, and the timing, actual number and value of the shares that are repurchased, if any, will be at the discretion of management and will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, the cost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, liquidity, and other factors deemed appropriate. Repurchases may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason. Any repurchased shares will have the status of treasury shares and may be used, if and when needed, for general corporate purposes.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve months ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>808.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>787.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>776.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities </td> <td>(2,212.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(267.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(203.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,945.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(63.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in) financing activities </td> <td>2,762.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(296.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(484.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,059.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>187.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>(8.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,349.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>219.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,130.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nFor 2021, the increase in cash provided by continuing operations was due primarily to an increase in operating performance and a decrease in interest expense, partially offset by an increase in working capital. For 2020, the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to a decrease in interest expense and a decrease in working capital, partially offset by a decrease in operating performance as a result of COVID-19.\nInvesting Activities\nFor 2021, the increase in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to the acquisitions of Neustar and Sontiq, various investments in nonconsolidated affiliates, and an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of our Healthcare business. For 2020, the increase in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to proceeds from the disposal of discontinued operations in 2019 that did not recur in 2020, an increase in cash used for acquisitions and an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of investments in 2020.\nFinancing Activities\nFor 2021, The increase in cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to debt proceeds used to fund the Neustar and Sontiq acquisitions, partially offset by the repayment of the debt from a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of our Healthcare business and increased debt financing fees. For 2020, the decrease in cash used in financing activities was due primarily to a decrease in debt prepayments, $150 million in 2020 compared with $340 million in 2019.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe make capital expenditures to grow our business by developing new and enhanced capabilities, to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the organization and to reduce risks. We make capital expenditures for product development, disaster recovery, security enhancements, regulatory compliance, and the replacement and upgrade of existing equipment at the end of its useful life.\nFor 2021, cash paid for capital expenditures increased $18.6 million to $224.2 million. For 2020, cash paid for capital expenditures increased $17.2 million to $205.6 million.\nDebt\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nOn June 15, 2010, we entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facility with various lenders. This facility has been amended several times and currently consists of the Senior Secured Term Loan B-6, Senior Secured Term Loan B-5, Senior Secured Term Loan A-3 (collectively, the Senior Secured Term Loans\u201d), and the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn December 1, 2021, we entered into an agreement to amend certain provisions of the Senior Secured Credit Facility and exercise our right to draw additional debt in an amount of $3,100.0 million, less original issue discount and deferred financing fees of $7.8 million and $43.6 million, respectively. Proceeds from the incremental loan on the Senior Secured Credit Facility were used to fund the acquisition of Neustar.\nIn addition, on December 1, 2021, we entered into a Second Lien Credit Agreement to obtain term loans in an aggregate amount of $640.0 million, less original issue discount and deferred financing fees of $3.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively, used for the acquisition of Sontiq. On December 23, 2021, we fully repaid the Second Lien Term Loan using a portion of the proceeds from our sale of the Healthcare business.\nHedges\nOn December 23, 2021, we entered into new interest rate swap agreements with various counter-parties that effectively fix our LIBOR exposure on a portion of our Senior Secured Term Loan or similar replacement debt. The new swaps commenced on December 31, 2021, and expires on December 31, 2026, with a current aggregate notional amount of $1,600.0 million that amortizes each quarter. The new swaps require TransUnion to pay fixed rates varying between 1.4280% and 1.4360% in exchange for receiving a variable rate that matches the variable rate on our loans. We have designated these swap agreements as cash flow hedges.\nOn March 10, 2020, we entered into two tranches of interest rate swap agreements with various counter-parties that effectively fix our LIBOR exposure on a portion of our Senior Secured Term Loans or similar replacement debt. The first swap commenced on June 30, 2020, and expires on June 30, 2022, with a current aggregate notional amount of $1,120.0 million that amortizes each quarter. The first swap requires TransUnion to pay fixed rates varying between 0.5200% and 0.5295% in exchange for receiving a variable rate that matches the variable rate on our loans. The second swap commences on June 30, 2022, and expires on June 30, 2025, with a current aggregate notional amount of $1,110.0 million that amortizes each quarter after it commences. The second swap requires TransUnion to pay fixed rates varying between 0.9125% and 0.9280% in exchange for receiving a variable rate that matches the variable rate on our loans. We have designated these swap agreements as cash flow hedges.\nOn December 17, 2018, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with various counter-parties that effectively fix our LIBOR exposure on a portion of our Senior Secured Term Loans or similar replacement debt, which is currently fixed at 2.702% and 2.706%. We have designated these swap agreements as cash flow hedges. The current aggregate notional amount under these agreements is $1,390.0 million, decreasing each quarter until the second agreement terminates on December 30, 2022.\nEffect of certain debt covenants\nA breach of any of the covenants under the agreements governing our debt could limit our ability to borrow funds under the senior secured revolving line of credit and could result in a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior secured credit facility, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding to be immediately due and payable, and the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay the amounts declared due, the lenders could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.\nWith certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Credit Facility obligations are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Trans Union LLC, including its investment in subsidiaries. The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains various restrictions and nonfinancial covenants, along with a senior secured net leverage ratio test. The nonfinancial covenants include restrictions on dividends, investments, dispositions, future borrowings and other specified payments, as well\nas additional reporting and disclosure requirements. The senior secured net leverage test must be met as a condition to incur additional indebtedness, make certain investments, and may be required to make certain restricted payments. The senior secured net leverage ratio must not exceed 5.5-to-1 at any such measurement date. Under the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, TransUnion may make dividend payments up to the greater of $100 million or 10.0% of Consolidated EBITDA per year, or an unlimited amount provided that no default or event of default exists and so long as the total net leverage ratio does not exceed 4.75-to-1. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nOur ability to meet our liquidity needs or to pay dividends on our common stock depends on our subsidiaries' earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, and other contractual restrictions.\nFor additional information about our debt and hedge, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt.\u201d\nContractual Obligations\nRefer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt,\u201d Note 13, Leases\u201d and Note 21, Commitments,\u201d for information about our long-term debt obligations, noncancelable lease obligations, and noncancelable purchase obligations as of December 31, 2021.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d Note 1, Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies,\u201d for additional information about our significant accounting and reporting policies that require us to make certain judgements and estimates in reporting our operating results and our assets and liabilities. The following paragraphs describe the accounting policies that require significant judgment and estimates due to inherent uncertainty or complexity.\nGoodwill\nAs of December 31, 2021, our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $5,525.7 million. As of December 31, 2021, we did not have any other indefinite-lived intangible assets. We conduct an impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired.\nWe have the option to first perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the qualitative analysis indicates that an impairment is more likely than not for any reporting unit, we perform a quantitative impairment analysis for that reporting unit. We have the option to bypass the qualitative analysis for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing a quantitative analysis.\nOur quantitative analysis consists of a fair value calculation for each reporting unit that combines an income approach, using the discounted cash flow method, and a market approach, using the guideline public company method. The quantitative impairment analysis requires the application of a number of significant assumptions, including estimates of future revenue growth rates, EBITDA margins, discount rates, and market multiples. The projected future revenue and EBITDA margins, and the resulting projected cash flows of each reporting unit is based on internal operating plans reviewed by management, extrapolated over the forecast period. The discount rate for each reporting unit is based on the weighted average cost of capital for the reporting unit. Market multiples are based on the Guideline Public Company Method using comparable publicly traded company multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization for a group of benchmark companies.\nWe believe the assumptions we use in our qualitative and quantitative analysis are reasonable and consistent with assumptions that would be used by other marketplace participants. In order to ensure the assumptions used in the analysis are reasonable, we compare the sum of the fair value of the reporting units to our market capitalization, to ensure it is within a reasonable range. However, such assumptions are inherently uncertain, and a change in assumptions could change the estimated fair values of our reporting units and, therefore, future impairment charges could be required, which could be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2021, we elected to bypass the qualitative goodwill impairment analysis, and instead performed a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for all reporting units. For each of our reporting units, the fair value exceeded the carrying value and no impairment was recorded. Further, a 10% decrease in the estimated cash flows or a 10% increase in the discount rate, combined with a 10% decrease in the market multiple would not result in an impairment for any of our reporting units. Our reporting units that have longer operating histories have greater headroom compared with reporting units that include significant recent acquisitions.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the acquisitions of Neustar for $3,106.6 million in cash, subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments, and Sontiq for $642.8 million in cash, subject to certain customary purchase price\nadjustments. These transactions were accounted for as business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination generally be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The determination of fair value requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been recorded as goodwill.\nThe valuations of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have not yet been finalized as of December 31, 2021. The purchase price allocations are preliminary and subject to change, including the valuation of intangible assets, income taxes and goodwill, among other items. The fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 31, 2021 are based on management's best estimates and assumptions as of the reporting date.\nIn determining the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets, we utilized various forms of the income approach, depending on the asset being valued. The estimation of fair value requires significant judgment related to cash flow forecasts, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in each cash flow stream, competitive trends, market comparables and other factors. Other inputs included historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, and growth rates.\nThe intangible assets were valued using the following valuation approaches:\nCustomer Relationships\nWe valued customer relationships using the multi-period excess-earnings method, a form of the income approach, which required the application of judgment for significant assumptions. Significant assumptions include customer attrition rates, EBITDA margins, and discount rates.\nTechnology and software\nWe valued the developed technology using the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach, which required the application of judgment for significant assumptions. Significant assumptions include the royalty rate, economic depreciation factors, and discount rates.\nOther identifiable intangible assets\nOther identifiable intangible assets include trade names and trademarks and non-compete agreements for key employees, which are not material. Trade names and trademarks were valued using the relief from royalty method and non-compete agreements were valued using the lost income method.\nWe engaged a third-party valuation specialist to assist in our analysis of the fair value of the acquired intangibles. All judgements, significant assumptions and estimates, and forecasts were either provided by or reviewed by us. While we chose to utilize a third-party valuation specialist for assistance, the fair value analysis and related valuations reflect the conclusions of management and not those of any third party. We believe the judgements and assumptions we have used are reasonable and consistent with assumptions that would be used by other marketplace participants. However such assumptions are inherently uncertain, and a change in assumptions could change the estimated fair values of the intangible assets which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are routinely named as defendants in, or parties to, various legal actions and proceedings relating to our current or past business operations. These actions generally assert claims for violations of federal or state credit reporting, consumer protection or privacy laws, or common law claims related to the unfair treatment of consumers, and may include claims for substantial or indeterminate compensatory or punitive damages, or injunctive relief, and may seek business practice changes. We believe that most of these claims are either without merit or we have valid defenses to the claims, and we vigorously defend these matters or seek non-monetary or small monetary settlements, if possible. However, due to the uncertainties inherent in litigation, we cannot predict the outcome of each claim in each instance.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we also are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal), certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. In connection with formal and informal inquiries by these regulators, we routinely receive requests, subpoenas and orders seeking documents, testimony, and other information in connection with various aspects of our activities.\nIn view of the inherent unpredictability of legal and regulatory matters, particularly where the damages sought are substantial or indeterminate or when the proceedings or investigations are in the early stages, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty the timing or ultimate resolution of legal and regulatory matters or the eventual loss, fines or penalties, if any, that may result. We establish reserves for legal and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and can be reasonably estimated. However, for certain of the matters, we are not able to reasonably estimate our exposure because damages have not been specified and (i) the proceedings are in early stages, (ii) there is uncertainty as to the\nlikelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (iii) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of similar matters pending against our competitors, (iv) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (v) there are legal issues of a first impression being presented. The actual costs of resolving legal and regulatory matters, however, may be substantially higher than the amounts reserved for those matters, and an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in particular quarterly or annual periods. We accrue amounts for certain legal and regulatory matters for which losses were considered to be probable of occurring based on our best estimate of the most likely outcome. It is reasonably possible actual losses could be significantly different from our current estimates. In addition, there are some matters for which it is reasonably possible that a loss will occur, however we cannot estimate a range of the potential losses for these matters. Legal fees incurred in connection with ongoing litigation are considered a period cost and are expensed as incurred.\nTo reduce our exposure to an unexpected significant monetary award resulting from an adverse judicial decision, we maintain insurance that we believe is appropriate and adequate based on our historical experience. We regularly advise our insurance carriers of the claims (threatened or pending) against us in the course of litigation and generally receive a reservation of rights letter from the carriers when such claims exceed applicable deductibles. We are not aware of any significant monetary claim that has been asserted against us in the course of pending litigation that would not have some level of coverage by insurance after the relevant deductible, if any, is met.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we accrued $85.6 million and $76.0 million, respectively, for anticipated claims. These amounts were recorded in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and the associated expenses were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Legal fees incurred in connection with ongoing litigation are considered period costs and are expensed as incurred.\nSee Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 22, Contingencies,\u201d for further information.\nIncome Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2021, our consolidated balance sheet included non-current deferred tax liabilities of $787.6 million. Certain deferred tax assets, including net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards, may be deducted from future taxable income in computing our federal income tax liability. Our deferred tax liability includes deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, temporary differences, and unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions.\nWe have made certain judgments and estimates to determine various tax amounts recorded, including future tax rates, future taxable income, whether it is more likely than not a tax position will be sustained, and the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit to record. We have deferred tax assets related to loss and credit carryforwards of $169.0 million, net of valuation allowances of $70.8 million. Our estimate of the amount of the deferred tax asset we can realize requires significant assumptions about projected revenues and income that are impacted by future market and economic conditions. We believe the judgments and estimates used are reasonable, but events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of tax audits may differ significantly from what is expected.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information about recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 1, Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies.\u201d", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of TransUnion's financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Information,\u201d including TransUnion's audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nReferences in this discussion and analysis to the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our\u201d refer to TransUnion and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including TransUnion Intermediate Holdings, Inc.\nOverview\nTransUnion is a leading global information and insights company that makes trust possible between businesses and consumers, working to help people around the world access opportunities that can lead to a higher quality of life.

We are focused on processes and foundational technology that allows us to leverage demand-led consumption from public cloud providers and from our high performance privately owned infrastructure.\nSegments\nWe manage our business and report our financial results, including disaggregated revenue, in three reportable segments: U.S. Markets, International and Consumer Interactive.\nU.S. Markets\nThe U.S. Markets segment provides consumer reports, actionable insights and analytics to businesses. These businesses use our services to acquire customers, assess consumers' ability to pay for services, identify cross-selling opportunities, measure and manage debt portfolio risk, collect debt, verify consumer identities and mitigate fraud risk. The core capabilities and delivery methods in our U.S. Markets segment allow us to serve a broad set of customers across industries. We report disaggregated revenue of our U.S. Markets segment for Financial Services and Emerging Verticals. The results of operations of Neustar are included in the Emerging Verticals and our consolidated statements of income since the date of the acquisition.\nInternational\nThe International segment provides services similar to our U.S. Markets segment to businesses in select regions outside the United States. Depending on the maturity of the credit economy in each country, services may include credit reports, analytics and technology solutions services, and other value-added risk management services. We also have insurance, business and automotive databases in select geographies. These services are offered to customers in a number of industries including financial services, retail credit, insurance, automotive, collections, public sector, and communications, and are delivered through both direct and indirect channels. The International segment also provides consumer services similar to those offered by our Consumer Interactive segment that help consumers proactively manage their personal finances.\nWe report disaggregated revenue of our International segment for the following regions: Canada, Latin America, the United Kingdom, Africa, India, and Asia Pacific.\nConsumer Interactive\nThe Consumer Interactive segment offers solutions that help consumers manage their personal finances and take precautions against identity theft. Services in this segment include credit reports and scores, credit monitoring, identity protection and resolution, and financial management for consumers. The segment also provides solutions that help businesses respond to data breach events. Our products are provided through user-friendly online and mobile interfaces and are supported by educational content and customer support. Our Consumer Interactive segment serves consumers through both direct and indirect channels. The results of operations of Sontiq are included in the Consumer Interactive segment and our consolidated statements of income since the date of the acquisition.\nCorporate\nIn addition, Corporate provides support services for each of the segments, holds investments, and conducts enterprise functions. Certain costs incurred in Corporate that are not directly attributable to one or more of the segments remain in Corporate. These costs are typically enterprise-level costs and are primarily administrative in nature.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nThe following are certain key factors that affect, or have recently affected, our results of operations:\nMacroeconomic and Industry Trends, Including the Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Business and Results of Operations\nOur revenues can be significantly influenced by general macroeconomic conditions, including the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of credit and capital, interest rates, inflation, employment levels, consumer confidence and housing demand. During 2020, the economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic had a material and adverse impact on numerous aspects of our business, including our results of operations in all of the markets where we operate. During 2021, we saw steady improvements in our results of operations in all these markets. This dynamic impacts the comparability of our results of operations, including our revenue and expenses, for each of the periods presented below. Also, given ongoing uncertainty and the unpredictable nature of the pandemic, including the rise of variants of the virus and the effectiveness of vaccines against those variants, COVID-19 may have a material and adverse impact on various aspects of our business in the future, including our results of operations.\nIn the markets where we compete, we have seen generally improving macroeconomic conditions since the second quarter of 2020. In the United States, we saw strong and improving macroeconomic conditions throughout 2021, including strong gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) growth, falling unemployment rates, and mortgage interest rates that are still near historic lows, all of which are evident in the significantly improved 2021 results of all of our segments. During 2021, we saw similar improvements in our international markets, although in certain of these markets there remains higher ongoing concerns about the impact of COVID-19. These macroeconomic improvements are evident in our 2021 results of operations, with all of our segments showing ongoing signs of improvements compared with last year.\nWhile we believe that a strong but slowing global GDP growth is expected for the coming year, such expectations are tempered by increasing concerns around rising inflation, geopolitical tensions and existing and new coronavirus variants, as well as waning consumer confidence, interest rate pressures and increasing supply chain and ongoing labor shortage concerns. Also, in certain of our markets, there remains concern regarding the impact COVID-19 could have on our business.\nEffects of Inflation\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. The impact of recent and expected future inflation increases could have a significant negative impact on our business, including decreased demand for our services as a result of rising interest rates.\nRecent Developments\nThe following developments impact the comparability of our balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows between years:\nOn January 24, 2022, we reached a tentative class settlement with the plaintiffs in Ramirez v. Trans Union LLC ( Ramirez\u201d or the Ramirez Litigation\u201d), which will require court approval. We expect this matter to be resolved by the end of 2022. Accordingly, in 2021, we revised the amount of the probable loss that we previously estimated, resulting in a reduction of our estimated liability and partially offsetting insurance receivable, and a corresponding net reduction recorded in selling, general and administrative expense for the year end December 31, 2021. See Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 22, Contingencies\u201d for additional information.\nDuring 2020, the economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic had a material and adverse impact on numerous aspects of our business, including the results of operations in all of our segments. During 2021, we saw ongoing improvements in our results of operations in all of the markets where we operate. This dynamic impacts the comparability of our results of operations between all of the periods presented below.\nOn December 23, 2021, we entered into a tranche of interest rate swap agreements with various counter-parties that effectively fix our LIBOR exposure on a portion of our Senior Secured Term Loan or similar replacement debt. The tranche commenced on December 31, 2021, and expires on December 31, 2026, with a current aggregate notional amount of $1,600.0 million that amortizes each quarter. The tranche requires TransUnion to pay fixed rates varying between 1.428% and 1.4360% in exchange for receiving a variable rate that matches the variable rate on our loans. We have designated these swap agreements as cash flow hedges.\nOn December 17, 2021, we completed the sale of our Healthcare business. The Healthcare business met the criteria for discontinued operations at December 31, 2021, as the sale represented a strategic shift in our business that will have a major effect on our results of operations. The results of operations are classified as discontinued operations, net of tax, in our consolidated statement of income for all periods presented. Discontinued operations, net of tax, also includes a gain on the disposal of the Healthcare business of $982.5, net of tax, in the consolidated statements of income for 2021. All tables and discussions below exclude the impact of the Healthcare business.\nOn December 1, 2021, we entered into an agreement to amend certain provisions of the Senior Secured Credit Facility and exercise our right to draw additional debt in an amount of $3,100.0 million, less original issue discount and deferred financing fees of $7.8 million and $43.6 million, respectively. Proceeds from the incremental loan on the Senior Secured Credit Facility were used to finance the acquisition of Neustar.\nOn December 1, 2021, we entered into a Second Lien Credit Agreement to obtain term loans in an aggregate amount of $640.0 million (the Second Lien Term Loan\u201d), less original issue discount and deferred financing fees of $3.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively, used to fund the acquisition of Sontiq. On December 23, 2021, we fully repaid the Second Lien Term Loan using a portion of the proceeds from our sale of the Healthcare business. As a result of the prepayment, we expensed the unamortized original issue discount and deferred fees to other income and expense in the consolidated statement of income.\nIn March 2021, we prepaid $85.0 million of our Senior Secured Term Loans, funded from our cash on hand. In December 2020,\nwe prepaid $150.0 million of our Senior Secured Term Loans, funded from our cash on hand.\nOn March 10, 2020, we entered into two tranches of interest rate swap agreements with various counter-parties that effectively fix our LIBOR exposure on a portion of our Senior Secured Term Loans or similar replacement debt. The first tranche commenced on June 30, 2020, and expires on June 30, 2022, with a current aggregate notional amount of $1,120.0 million that amortizes each quarter. The first tranche requires TransUnion to pay fixed rates varying between 0.5200% and 0.5295% in exchange for receiving a variable rate that matches the variable rate on our loans. The second tranche commences on June 30, 2022, and expires on June 30, 2025, with an initial aggregate notional amount of $1,110.0 million that amortizes each quarter after it commences. The second tranche requires TransUnion to pay fixed rates varying between 0.9125% and 0.9280% in exchange for receiving a variable rate that matches the variable rate on our loans. We have designated these swap agreements as cash flow hedges.\nIn December 2020, we prepaid $150.0 million of our Senior Secured Term Loans, funded from our cash on hand. During 2019, we prepaid $340.0 million of our Senior Secured Term Loans, also funded from cash on hand. These transactions affect the comparability of interest expense between 2021, 2020 and 2019 as further discussed in Results of Operations - Non-Operating Income and Expense\u201d below.\nOn November 15, 2019, we refinanced our B-3 and B-4 loans with a new tranche of Senior Secured Term Loan B ( Senior Secured Term Loan B-5\u201d) which, along with cash of $9.0 million, was used to pay-off the Senior Secured Term Loan B-3 and Senior Secured Term Loan B-4 loans. On December 10, 2019, we refinanced our A-2 loan with a new tranche of Senior Secured Term Loan A ( Senior Secured Term Loan A-3\u201d), which was used to pay-off our existing Senior Secured Term Loan A-2 loans. With this refinance, we also converted the existing Senior Secured Revolving Line of Credit into a new Senior Secured Revolving Line of Credit.\nRecent Acquisitions\nWe selectively evaluate acquisitions as a means to expand our business and to enter new markets. Since January 1, 2019, we have completed the following acquisitions, including those that impact the comparability of our results between periods:\n\u2022On December 1, 2021, we acquired 100% of the equity of Neustar. Neustar, a premier identity resolution company with leading solutions in Marketing, Risk and Communications, enables customers to build connected consumer experiences by combining decision analytics with real-time identity resolution services driven by its OneID platform. The results of operations of Neustar are included in Emerging Verticals as part of our U.S. Markets segment in our consolidated statements of income since the date of the acquisition. See Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 2, Business Acquisitions.\u201d\n\u2022On December 1, 2021, we acquired 100% of the equity of Sontiq. Sontiq, a leader in digital identity protection and security, provides solutions including identity monitoring, restoration, and response products and services to help empower consumers and businesses to proactively protect against identity theft and cyber threats. The results of operations of Sontiq, which are not material to our consolidated financial statements, are included in the Consumer Interactive segment in our consolidated statements of income since the date of the acquisition. See Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 2, Business Acquisitions,\u201d for additional information.\n\u2022On October 14, 2020, we acquired 100% of the equity of Tru Optik Data Corp ( Tru Optik\u201d). Tru Optik uses its custom audience-building platform to deliver predictive scoring to improve the performance of custom digital marketing campaigns.

We report disaggregated revenue of our U.S. Markets segment for the following verticals:\n\u2022Financial Services: The Financial Services vertical, which accounts for approximately 60.2% of our 2021 U.S. Markets revenue, consists of our consumer lending, mortgage, auto and cards and payments lines of business. Our financial services customers consist of most banks, credit unions, finance companies, POS/BNPL lenders, auto lenders, mortgage lenders, FinTechs, and other consumer lenders in the United States. We also distribute our solutions through most major resellers, secondary market players and sales agents. Beyond traditional lenders, we work with a variety of credit arrangers, such as auto dealers and peer-to-peer lenders. We provide solutions across every aspect of the lending lifecycle; customer acquisition and engagement, fraud and ID management, retention and recovery. Our products are focused on mitigating risk and include credit reporting, credit marketing, analytics and consulting, identity verification and authentication and debt recovery solutions.\n\u2022Emerging Verticals: Emerging verticals include Insurance, Services and Collections, Tenant and Employment, Technology, Commerce & Communications, Public Sector, Media, and other emerging verticals we serve, as well as our Neustar business. Our solutions in these verticals are also data-driven and address the entire customer lifecycle. We offer onboarding and transaction processing products, scoring and analytic products, marketing solutions, fraud and identity management solutions and customer retention solutions.\nInternational\nThe International segment provides services similar to our U.S. Markets segment to businesses in select regions outside the United States. Depending on the maturity of the credit economy in each country, services may include credit reports, analytics and solutions services, and other value-added risk management services. In addition, we have insurance, business and automotive databases in select geographies. These services are offered to customers in a number of industries including financial services, retail credit, insurance, automotive, collections, public sector and communications, and are delivered through both direct and indirect channels. The International segment also provides consumer services similar to those offered by our Consumer Interactive segment to help consumers proactively manage their personal finances.\nWe report disaggregated revenue of our International segment for the following regions: Canada, Latin America, the United Kingdom, Africa, India, and Asia Pacific.\nConsumer Interactive\nThe Consumer Interactive segment offers solutions that help consumers manage their personal finances and take precautions against identity theft. Services in this segment include credit reports and scores, credit monitoring, identity protection and resolution and financial management for consumers. The segment also provides solutions that help businesses respond to data breach events. Our products are provided through user-friendly online and mobile interfaces and are supported by educational content and customer support. Our Consumer Interactive segment serves consumers through both direct and indirect channels. With our acquisition of Sontiq in 2021, we have added to our foundational credit monitoring solutions with a comprehensive set of identity protection offerings. The results of operations of Sontiq, which are not material to our consolidated financial statements, are included in the Consumer Interactive segment in our consolidated statements of income since the date of the acquisition.\nCost of Services\nCosts of services include data acquisition and royalty fees, personnel costs related to our databases and software applications, consumer and call center support costs, hardware and software maintenance costs, telecommunication expenses and occupancy costs associated with the facilities where these functions are performed.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include personnel-related costs for sales, administrative and management employees, costs for professional and consulting services, advertising and occupancy and facilities expense of these functions.\nNon-Operating Income and Expense\nNon-operating income and expense includes interest expense, interest income, earnings from equity-method investments, dividends from cost-method investments, fair-value adjustments of equity-method and Cost Method investments, if any, expenses related to successful and unsuccessful business acquisitions, loan fees, debt refinancing expenses, certain acquisition-related gains and losses and other non-operating income and expenses.\nResults of Operations-Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nKey Performance Measures\nManagement, including our chief operating decision maker ( CODM\u201d), evaluates the financial performance of our businesses based on a variety of key indicators. These indicators include the GAAP measures of revenue, segment Adjusted EBITDA, cash provided by operating activities and cash paid for capital expenditures and the non-GAAP measures Adjusted Revenue and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. Refer to the Non-GAAP Key Performance Indicators\u201d section immediately below the table for more information, including the definitions of our non-GAAP measures.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, these key performance indicators were as follows:\n\nnm: not meaningful\nAs a result of displaying amounts in millions, rounding differences may exist in the table above.\n\nnm: not meaningful\nAs a result of displaying amounts in millions, rounding differences may exist in the table above.\n1.This adjustment represents certain non-cash adjustments related to acquired entities, predominantly adjustments to increase revenue resulting from purchase accounting reductions to deferred revenue we record on the opening balance sheet of acquired entities. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we no longer have these adjustments to revenue.\n2.Consisted of stock-based compensation and cash-settled stock-based compensation.\n3.For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, consisted of the following adjustments: $48.1 million of acquisition expenses; $9.1 million of Neustar integration costs; $8.4 million of adjustments to contingent consideration expense from previous acquisitions; a $1.1 million gain reduction to notes receivable that were converted into equity upon acquisition and consolidation of an entity; a ($12.5) million gain on a Cost Method investment resulting from an observable price change for a similar investment of the same issuer; a ($1.1) million reimbursement for transition services related to divested businesses, net of separation expenses; and a ($0.5) million gain on the sale of a Cost Method investment.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, consisted of the following adjustments: $7.5 million of Callcredit integration costs; $7.0 million of acquisition expenses; a $4.8 million loss on the impairment of a Cost Method investment; $1.7 million of adjustments to contingent consideration expense from previous acquisitions; an ($8.1) million remeasurement gain on notes receivable that were converted into equity upon acquisition and consolidation of an entity; a ($2.5) million gain on a Cost Method investment resulting from an observable price change for a similar investment of the same issuer; a ($1.8) million gain on the disposal of assets of a small business in our United Kingdom region; and a ($0.1) million reimbursement for transition services provided to the buyers of certain of our discontinued operations.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, consisted of the following adjustments: a ($31.2) million gain on a Cost Method investment resulting from an observable price change for a similar investment of the same issuer; a ($0.5) million reimbursement for transition services provided to the buyers of certain of our discontinued operations; $15.8 million of Callcredit integration costs; a $10.0 million loss on the impairment of certain Cost Method investments; a $3.7 million loss on assets of a small business in our United Kingdom region that are classified as held-for-sale; $2.4\nmillion of acquisition expenses; and a $0.8 million adjustment to contingent consideration expense from previous acquisitions.\n4.Represents expenses associated with our accelerated technology investment to migrate to the cloud.\n5.For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, consisted of the following adjustments: $17.9 million of deferred loan fees written off as a result of the prepayments on our debt; $1.2 million for certain legal and regulatory expenses; a ($3.5) million recovery from the Fraud Incident, net of additional administrative expense; and a $3.7 million net loss from currency remeasurement of our foreign operations, loan fees and other.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, consisted of the following adjustments: $34.7 million for certain legal expenses; $0.9 million of deferred loan fees written off as a result of the prepayments on our debt; a $(1.5) million recovery from the Fraud Incident, net of additional administrative expense; and $1.4 million net loss from currency remeasurement of our foreign operations, loan fees and other.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, consisted of the following adjustments: $13.5 million of expenses associated with the Fraud Incident, net of the portion that is attributable to the non-controlling interest; $13.0 million of fees related to the refinancing of senior secured credit facility; $2.0 million of deferred loan fees written off as a result of the prepayments on our debt; and $1.3 million loss from currency remeasurement, loan fees, reduction to expenses for certain legal and regulatory matters and other.\nNon-GAAP Key Performance Indicators\nAdjusted Revenue\nWe define Adjusted Revenue as GAAP revenue adjusted for certain acquisition-related deferred revenue and non-core contract-related revenue. We present Adjusted Revenue as a supplemental measure of revenue because we believe it provides a basis to compare revenue between periods. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we no longer have these adjustments to revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to TransUnion plus (less) loss (income) from discontinued operations, net of tax plus net interest expense, plus (less) provision (benefit) for income taxes, plus depreciation and amortization, plus (less) the revenue adjustments included in Adjusted Revenue, plus stock-based compensation, plus mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and business optimization-related expenses including Neustar and Callcredit integration-related expenses, plus certain accelerated technology investment expenses to migrate to the cloud, plus (less) certain other expenses (income).\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our operating performance because it eliminates the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our cash operations and ongoing operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also a measure frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies similar to ours. Our board of directors and executive management team use Adjusted EBITDA as a compensation measure under our incentive compensation plan. Under the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility, our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments and paying dividends is tied to a ratio based on Adjusted EBITDA. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt.\u201d Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our capital expenditures, interest, income tax, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and certain other income and expense. Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial condition or profitability under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to operating income or net income as indicators of operating performance. We believe that the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss) attributable to TransUnion. The table above provides a reconciliation from our net income (loss) attributable to TransUnion to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nRevenue\nAs mentioned above, the effects of COVID-19 impact the comparability of revenue between periods for all discussions below.\nFor 2021, revenue increased $429.6 million compared with 2020, due primarily to improving macroeconomic conditions in all of our markets, revenue from new product initiatives, revenue from our recent acquisitions in the U.S. Markets and Consumer Interactive segments, and an increase of 1.1% increase from the impact of strengthening foreign currencies.\nFor 2020, revenue increased $67.4 million compared with 2019, due primarily to organic growth in the Financial Services vertical in the U.S. Markets segment, the Consumer Interactive segment, and the Canada region in the International segment, revenue from recent acquisitions in U.S. Markets Emerging Verticals, and revenue from new product initiatives, partially offset by a decrease in organic revenue in U.S. Markets Emerging Verticals and the other regions of the International segment, and a 0.9% decrease from the impact of weakening foreign currencies.\nRevenue by segment and a more detailed explanation of revenue within each segment are as follows:\n\nnm: not meaningful\nAs a result of displaying amounts in millions, rounding differences may exist in the table above.\nU.S. Markets Segment\nFor 2021, U.S. Markets revenue increased $280.3 million compared with 2020, primarily due to increases in revenue in both verticals including revenue from our acquisition of Neustar.\nFor 2020, U.S. Markets revenue increased $94.0 million compared with 2019, due primarily to an increase in revenue in the Financial Services vertical.\nFinancial Services: For 2021, Financial Services revenue increased $139.3 million due primarily to improvements in macroeconomic conditions and new product initiatives in our consumer lending, card and banking, and auto lines of business, partially offset by a decrease in revenue in our mortgage line of business as volumes have declined due to rising interest rates.\nWe anticipate a decline in our mortgage line of business will continue for the foreseeable future as interest rates are expected to continue to rise.\nFor 2020, Financial Services revenue increased $90.6 million due primarily to improvements in market conditions in our mortgage line of business, as historically low interest rates drove refinance activity and the home purchase market experienced modest growth. The growth in the mortgage line of business was partially offset by decreases in our other lines of business, which have shown signs of improvement since the lows in April 2020.\nEmerging Verticals: For 2021, Emerging Verticals revenue increased $141.0 million due primarily to improving macroeconomic conditions in most of our verticals, revenue from new product initiatives, and an increase from recent acquisitions. Every vertical had an increase in revenue during the year, except Services and Collections, which was down slightly. Our recent acquisitions accounted for an increase in revenue of 12.0%.\nFor 2020, Emerging Verticals revenue increased $3.3 million due primarily to an increase in the Media, Public Sector, Insurance and Tenant & Employment verticals, partially offset by a decrease in the Collections and Diversified Markets verticals. Recent acquisitions accounted for an increase in revenue of 1.8%.\nInternational Segment\nFor 2021, International revenue increased $119.2 million, or 20.5%, compared with 2020, due primarily to higher local currency revenue from increased volumes resulting from improving economic conditions and from new product initiatives, and an increase of 4.5% from the impact of strengthening foreign currencies.\nFor 2020, International revenue decreased $40.8 million, or 6.5%, compared with 2019.

The increase was due primarily to higher local currency revenue from increased volumes resulting from improving economic conditions and from new product initiatives and an increase of 7.7% from the impact of strengthening foreign currencies.\nFor 2020, Canada revenue increased $3.9 million, or 3.7% compared with 2019. The increase was due primarily to higher local currency revenue from increased volumes including new product initiatives, partially offset by a decrease from the impact of COVID-19 primarily in the second and third quarters, and a decrease of less than 1.0% from the impact of weakening foreign currencies.\nLatin America: For 2021, Latin America revenue increased $16.7 million, or 19.3%, compared with 2020. The increase was due primarily to higher local currency revenue from increased volumes resulting from improving economic conditions and from new product initiatives, partially offset by a decrease of 1.4% from the impact of weakening foreign currencies.\nFor 2020, Latin America revenue decreased $17.7 million, or 17.0%, compared with 2019. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in local currency revenue as a result of COVID-19 primarily in the second, third and fourth quarters, and a decrease of 11.5% from the impact of weakening foreign currencies, partially offset by higher local currency revenue from increased volumes including new product initiatives in the first quarter.\nUnited Kingdom: For 2021, United Kingdom revenue increased $33.4 million, or 18.2%, compared with 2020. The increase was due primarily to higher local currency revenue from increased volumes resulting from improving economic conditions and from new product initiatives and an increase of 7.9% from the impact of strengthening foreign currencies.\nFor 2020, United Kingdom revenue decreased $3.6 million, or 1.9%, compared with 2019. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in local currency revenue as a result of COVID-19 primarily in the second, third and fourth quarters, partially offset by higher local currency revenue from increased volumes including new product initiatives in the first quarter and an increase of 0.7% from the impact of strengthening foreign currencies.\nAfrica: For 2021, Africa revenue increased $10.5 million, or 21.4%. The increase was due primarily to higher local currency revenue from increased volumes resulting from improving economic conditions and from new product initiatives, and an increase of 10.3% from the impact of strengthening foreign currencies.\nFor 2020, Africa revenue decreased $12.2 million, or 20.0%, due primarily to a decrease in local currency revenue as a result of COVID-19 primarily in the second, third and fourth quarters, and a decrease of 10.1% from the impact of weakening foreign currencies, partially offset by higher local currency revenue from increased volumes including new product initiatives in the first quarter.\nIndia: For 2021, India revenue increased $33.1 million, or 33.1%, due primarily to higher local currency revenue from increased volumes resulting from improving economic conditions and from new product initiatives, and an increase of 0.1% from the impact of strengthening foreign currencies.\nFor 2020, India revenue decreased $8.1 million, or 7.5%, due primarily to a decrease in local currency revenue as a result of COVID-19 primarily in the second and third quarters, and a decrease of 4.5% from the impact of weakening foreign currencies, partially offset by an increase in local currency revenue from increased volumes including new product initiatives in the first and fourth quarters.\nAsia Pacific: For 2021, Asia Pacific revenue increased $6.5 million, or 11.6%, due primarily to higher local currency revenue from increased volumes resulting from improving economic conditions and from new product initiatives, partially offset by a decrease of 0.2% from the impact of weakening foreign currencies.\nFor 2020, Asia Pacific revenue decreased $3.0 million, or 5.0%, due primarily to a decrease in local currency revenue as a result of COVID-19 primarily in the second, third and fourth quarters, partially offset by an increase of 1.5% from the impact of strengthening foreign currencies and an increase in local currency revenue from increased volumes including new product initiatives in the first quarter.\nConsumer Interactive Segment\nFor 2021, Consumer Interactive revenue increased $32.7 million, or 6.4%, compared with 2020, due primarily to an increase in revenue from both our direct and indirect channels including revenue from our acquisition of Sontiq. In our indirect channel, revenue increased primarily due to a large breach services contract which was recognized in the second half of 2021.\nFor 2020, Consumer Interactive revenue increased $15.3 million compared with 2019, due primarily to an increase in revenue from our direct channel, partially offset by a decrease in our indirect channel as a result of COVID-19 primarily in the second, third and fourth quarters.\nOperating Expenses\nAs mentioned above, the effects of COVID-19 impact the comparability of expenses between periods for all discussions below. Operating expenses for the periods reported were as follows:\n\nAs a result of displaying amounts in millions, rounding differences may exist in the table above.\nCost of Services\nFor 2021, cost of services increased $137.7 million compared with 2020. The increase was due primarily to:\n\u2022an increase in product costs resulting from the increase in revenue, primarily in our U.S. Markets segment;\n\u2022operating and integration-related costs relating to the business acquisitions in our U.S. Markets and Consumer Interactive segments;\n\u2022an increase in labor costs, primarily in our International segment, as we continue to invest in key strategic growth initiatives;\n\u2022an increase in costs from our accelerated technology investment; and\n\u2022the impact of strengthening foreign currencies on the expenses of our International segment.\nFor 2020, cost of services increased $48.4 million compared with 2019. The increase was due primarily to:\n\u2022an increase in labor costs in our U.S. Markets segment, primarily due to key strategic growth initiatives;\n\u2022an increase in product costs in our U.S. Markets and Consumer Interactive segments; and\n\u2022an increase in costs from our accelerated technology investment;\npartially offset by:\n\u2022a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses due to travel restrictions and shelter in place orders related to COVID-19; and\n\u2022the impact of weakening foreign currencies on the expenses of our International segment.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nFor 2021, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $114.2 million compared with 2020. The increase was due primarily to:\n\u2022an increase in labor costs across all segments and Corporate, including an increase in incentive and stock-based compensation due to improved performance, as we continue to invest in key strategic growth initiatives;\n\u2022operating and integration-related costs from our recent acquisitions in our U.S. Markets and Consumer Interactive segments;\n\u2022an increase in costs from our accelerated technology investment; and\n\u2022the impact of strengthening foreign currencies on the expenses of our International segment,\npartially offset by:\n\u2022a decrease in costs for certain legal and regulatory matters; and\n\u2022a decrease in bad debt expense, as we have reversed reserves that were recorded at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic;\nFor 2020, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $52.3 million compared with 2019. The increase was due primarily to:\n\u2022an increase of $58.1 million for legal and regulatory matters, primarily related to the Ramirez litigation;\n\u2022an increase in bad debt expense due to an increase in our estimated reserves including the expected impact of COVID-19 primarily in our U.S. Markets and International segments;\n\u2022an increase in advertising costs, primarily in our Consumer Interactive segment; and\n\u2022an increase in costs from our accelerated technology investment;\npartially offset by:\n\u2022a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses due to travel restrictions and shelter in place orders related to COVID-19;\n\u2022a decrease in incentive and stock-based compensation from lower expected achievement on certain performance-based awards due to COVID-19; and\n\u2022the impact of overall weakening foreign currencies on the expenses of our International segment.\nDepreciation and amortization\nFor 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $30.3 million compared with 2020, due primarily to recent acquisitions of tangible and intangible assets.\nFor 2020, depreciation and amortization increased $8.2 million compared with 2019, due primarily to recent acquisitions of tangible and intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in amortization related to certain intangible assets from our 2012 change in control transaction that have become fully amortized. partially offset by a decrease in amortization related to certain intangible assets from our 2012 change in control transaction that have become fully amortized.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin\nAs mentioned above, the effects of COVID-19 impact the comparability of Adjusted EBITDA between periods for all discussions below.\n\nnm: not meaningful\nAs a result of displaying amounts in millions, rounding differences may exist in the table above.\n1.See the reconciliation of net income attributable to TransUnion to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of segment revenue to segment Adjusted Revenue in the Key Performance Measures\u201d section at the beginning of our discussion about our Results of Operations. See the Revenue\u201d table above for details of the intersegment revenue eliminations by segment. Segment Adjusted EBITDA margins are calculated using segment gross Adjusted Revenue and segment Adjusted EBITDA. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated using consolidated Adjusted Revenue and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA.\nFor 2021, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA increased $203.2 million due primarily to:\n\u2022an increase in revenue from improving macroeconomic conditions in all of our markets;\n\u2022a decrease in costs for certain legal and regulatory matters; and\n\u2022a decrease in bad debt expense, as we have reversed reserves that were recorded at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic,\npartially offset by:\n\u2022an increase in labor costs across all segments and Corporate, including an increase in incentive compensation due to improved performance;\n\u2022operating and integration-related costs from our recent acquisitions in our U.S. Markets and Consumer Interactive segments;\n\u2022an increase in product costs resulting from the increase in revenue in all of our segments;\nFor 2021, Adjusted EBITDA margins for the U.S. Markets segment increased due primarily to an increase in revenue and improving market conditions in both of our verticals and a decrease in bad debt expense, partially offset by an increase in product costs resulting from the increase in revenue and an increase in incentive compensation due to improved performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins for the International segment increased due primarily to an increase in revenue and improving market conditions in all of our regions and a decrease in bad debt expense, partially offset by an increase in product costs resulting from the increase in revenue and an increase in incentive compensation due to improved performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins for the Consumer Interactive were relatively consistent compared to 2020.\nFor 2020, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA decreased $12.3 million due primarily to:\n\u2022an increase in expense for certain legal and regulatory matters;\n\u2022a decrease in revenue in our International segment;\n\u2022an increase in labor costs in our U.S. Markets segment, as we invested in key strategic growth initiatives;\n\u2022an increase in product costs in our U.S. Markets and Consumer Interactive segments; and\n\u2022an increase in advertising costs in our Consumer Interactive segment,\npartially offset by:\n\u2022an increase in revenue in our U.S. Markets and Consumer Interactive segments;\n\u2022a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses due to travel restrictions and shelter in place orders related to COVID-19; and\n\u2022the impact of weakening foreign currencies on the expenses of our International segment.\nFor 2020, Adjusted EBITDA margins for the U.S. Markets segment decreased due primarily to the impact of COVID-19 on revenue in Emerging Verticals, an increase in expense for certain legal and regulatory matters and an increase in labor costs primarily due to key strategic growth initiatives, partially offset by improving market conditions in the mortgage line of business in the Financial Services Vertical and a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins for the International segment decreased due primarily to the impact of COVID-19 on revenue, partially offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses and the impact of weakening foreign currencies on the expenses of our International segment.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins for the Consumer Interactive segment decreased due primarily to an increase in advertising costs and variable product costs, partially offset by an increase in revenue.\nNon-Operating Income and (Expense)\n\nnm: not meaningful\nAs a result of displaying amounts in millions, rounding differences may exist in the table above.\nInterest expense\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, interest expense decreased $13.7 million compared with 2020. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, interest expense decreased $47.5 million compared with 2019. The decrease in interest expense for both periods is due primarily to the impact of a decrease in our average interest rate and a decrease in our average outstanding principal balance, and in 2021, partially offset by expenses attributable new borrowings and early prepayments late in the year as described in further detail below.\nIn December 2019, we refinanced our Senior Secured Credit Facility which decreased our average interest rate in 2020 and 2021. Further, we prepaid $340.0 million, $150.0 million and $85.0 million of our Senior Secured Term Loans in the second half of 2019, in 2020, and in 2021, respectively. These prepayments decreased our average outstanding principal balance in each subsequent period.\nOn December 1, 2021, we borrowed $3,100.0 of additional debt under our Senior Secured Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of Neustar. In addition, on December 1, 2021, we entered into a Second Lien Credit Agreement to obtain term loans in an aggregate amount of $640.0 million (the Second Lien Term Loan\u201d) which was used to fund the acquisition of Sontiq. On December 23, 2021, we fully repaid the Second Lien Term Loan using a portion of the proceeds from our sale of the Healthcare business.\nThese factors impact the comparability of interest expense between periods. Our future interest expense could be materially impacted by changes in our variable interest rates to the extent our variable rate debt is not hedged with fixed rate debt, additional borrowings, or additional prepayments. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt,\u201d for additional information about our debt.\nAcquisition fees\nAcquisition fees represent costs we have incurred for various acquisition-related efforts, and include costs related to our acquisitions of Neustar and Sontiq in 2021, Tru Optik and Signal Digital in 2020, and TruSignal in 2019, as well as costs of our other acquisition efforts. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 2, Business Acquisitions,\u201d for additional information about our acquisition-related efforts.\nLoan fees\nFor 2021, loan fees included $17.9 million of financing fees and other net costs expensed as a result of our repayment of our Second Lien Term Loan and the partial repayment of our other Term Loans. For 2020, loan fees were not significant. For 2019, loan fees included, among other things, $13.0 million of refinancing fees and other net costs expensed as a result of refinancing our Senior Secured Term Loan late in 2019. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt,\u201d for additional information about our debt.\nOther income (expense), net includes currency remeasurement gains and losses, dividends received from cost method investments, gains and losses on Cost Method investments, if any, and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expense items, including recoveries from the Fraud Incident.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor 2021, we reported a 26.1% effective tax rate, which is higher than the 21.0% U.S. federal corporate statutory rate due primarily to recording tax expense related to the remeasurement of our U.K. deferred taxes to reflect an increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate enacted in the second quarter 2021 and nondeductible transaction costs and penalties, partially offset by excess tax benefits on stock based compensation and a tax benefit related to electing the Global Intangible Low Tax Income ( GILTI\u201d) high-tax exclusion retroactively for the 2018 and 2019 tax years. On July 20, 2020, the U.S. Treasury issued and enacted final regulations related to GILTI that allow certain U.S. taxpayers to elect to exclude foreign income that is subject to a high effective tax rate from their GILTI inclusions. The GILTI high-tax exclusion is an annual election and is retroactively available.\nFor 2020, we reported a 21.5% effective tax rate, which is higher than the 21.0% U.S. federal corporate statutory rate due primarily to an increase in state taxes, valuation allowances on foreign tax credit carryforwards, and uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties, partially offset by excess tax benefits on stock based compensation and foreign taxes in jurisdictions which have tax rates lower than the U.S. federal corporate statutory rate.\nFor 2019, we reported a 18.8% effective tax rate, which is lower than the 21.0% U.S. federal corporate statutory rate due primarily to excess tax benefits on stock based compensation, partially offset by U.S. federal tax on foreign earnings and foreign taxes in jurisdictions which have tax rates that are higher than the U.S. federal corporate statutory rate. We also changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion on our unremitted foreign earnings during the fourth quarter 2019, such that management intends to repatriate current year foreign earnings, net of working capital requirements, and indefinitely reinvest prior years' foreign earnings. The change in assertion had an immaterial impact on the current year effective tax rate.\nSignificant Changes in Assets and Liabilities\nTotal goodwill and intangibles at December 31, 2021 increased compared with December 31, 2020, due primarily to the acquisitions of Sontiq and Neustar. See Recent Transactions\u201d above and Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 2, Business Acquisitions\u201d for additional information.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents increased due primarily to proceeds received from the disposal of our Healthcare business in December, 2021. See Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 3, Discontinued Operations,\u201d for additional information. A portion of the proceeds from the disposal of our Healthcare business were used to fully repay the Second Lien Term Loan obtained to finance the acquisition of Sontiq. See Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt,\u201d for additional information.\nTotal debt at December 31, 2021 increased due to additional financings in connection with these acquisitions. See Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt,\u201d for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, and our senior secured revolving line of credit. Our principal uses of liquidity are working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other capital structure obligations, business acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. We believe our cash on hand, cash generated from operations, and funds available under the senior secured revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures, debt service and other capital structure obligations, business acquisitions and operating needs for the foreseeable future. Our ability to maintain adequate liquidity for our operations in the future is dependent upon a number of factors, including our revenue, macroeconomic conditions, our ability to contain costs, including capital expenditures, and to collect accounts receivable, and various other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We will continue to monitor our liquidity position and may elect to raise funds through debt or equity financing in the future to fund operations, significant investments or acquisitions that are consistent with our growth strategy\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $1,842.4 million and $492.7 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of which $205.0 million and $232.0 million were held outside the United States. As of December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding balance under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and $0.1 million of outstanding letters of credit, and could have borrowed up to the remaining $299.9 million available.\nWe also have the ability to request incremental loans on the same terms under the existing senior secured credit facility up to the greater of an additional $1,000.0 million and 100% of Consolidated EBITDA. In addition, so long as the senior secured net leverage ratio does not exceed 4.25-to-1, we may incur additional incremental loans, subject to certain additional conditions and commitments by existing or new lenders to fund any additional borrowings.\nWith certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Credit Facility obligations are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Trans Union LLC, including its investments in subsidiaries. The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains various restrictions and nonfinancial covenants, along with a senior secured net leverage ratio test. The nonfinancial covenants include restrictions on dividends, investments, dispositions, future borrowings and other specified payments, as well as additional reporting and disclosure requirements. The senior secured net leverage test must be met as a condition to incur additional indebtedness, make certain investments, and may be required to make certain restricted payments. The senior secured net leverage ratio must not exceed 5.5-to-1 at any such measurement date.\nOn January 31, 2022, we prepaid $400 million of our Senior Secured Term Loans, funded from our cash on hand. The remaining balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is consistent with our short-term cash needs and investment objectives.\nIn April 2022, we are expected to pay approximately $352 million of income taxes related to the gain on the sale of our Healthcare business.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, we expect to close on the announced agreement to acquire Verisk Financial Services, including Argus Information and Advisory Services, and pay the approximate $515 million purchase price. We intend to fund the acquisition through cash on hand. For additional information on this transaction, see Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 25, Subsequent Events.\u201d\nThe Company may be required to make additional principal payments on the Senior Secured Term Loan B based on excess cash flows of the prior year, as defined in the agreement. There were no excess cash flows for 2021 and therefore no additional payment will be required in 2022. Additional payments based on excess cash flows could be due in future years. See Part II,\nItem 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt,\u201d for additional information about our debt.\nDuring 2021 and 2020, we prepaid $85.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, towards our Senior Secured Term Loans, funded from our cash on hand.\nDuring 2021, the board of directors declared one quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share and three quarterly dividends of $0.095 per share, of which we paid $69.8 million. During 2020, the board of directors declared four quarterly dividends of $0.075 per share, of which we paid $57.6 million.\nAny determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. We currently have capacity and intend to continue to pay a quarterly dividend, subject to approval by our board.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, 1.2 million, outstanding employee restricted stock units vested and became taxable to the employees. Employees satisfy their payroll tax withholding obligations in a net share settlement arrangement. We remitted cash to the respective governmental agencies equivalent to the value of the shares employees used to satisfy their withholding obligations of $36.8 million. There will be a similar cash remittance in February 2022.\nOn February 13, 2017, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0 million of our common stock over the next 3 years. Our board of directors removed the three-year time limitation on February 8, 2018. To date, we have repurchased $133.5 million of our common stock and have the ability to repurchase the remaining $166.5 million.\nWe have no obligation to repurchase additional shares, and the timing, actual number and value of the shares that are repurchased, if any, will be at the discretion of management and will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, the cost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, liquidity, and other factors deemed appropriate. Repurchases may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason. Any repurchased shares will have the status of treasury shares and may be used, if and when needed, for general corporate purposes.\nSources and Uses of Cash\n\nOperating Activities\nFor 2021, the increase in cash provided by continuing operations was due primarily to an increase in operating performance and a decrease in interest expense, partially offset by an increase in working capital. For 2020, the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to a decrease in interest expense and a decrease in working capital, partially offset by a decrease in operating performance as a result of COVID-19.\nInvesting Activities\nFor 2021, the increase in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to the acquisitions of Neustar and Sontiq, various investments in nonconsolidated affiliates, and an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of our Healthcare business. For 2020, the increase in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to proceeds from the disposal of discontinued operations in 2019 that did not recur in 2020, an increase in cash used for acquisitions and an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of investments in 2020.\nFinancing Activities\nFor 2021, The increase in cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to debt proceeds used to fund the Neustar and Sontiq acquisitions, partially offset by the repayment of the debt from a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of our Healthcare business and increased debt financing fees. For 2020, the decrease in cash used in financing activities was due primarily to a decrease in debt prepayments, $150 million in 2020 compared with $340 million in 2019.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe make capital expenditures to grow our business by developing new and enhanced capabilities, to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the organization and to reduce risks. We make capital expenditures for product development, disaster recovery, security enhancements, regulatory compliance, and the replacement and upgrade of existing equipment at the end of its useful life.\nFor 2021, cash paid for capital expenditures increased $18.6 million to $224.2 million. For 2020, cash paid for capital expenditures increased $17.2 million to $205.6 million.\nDebt\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nOn June 15, 2010, we entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facility with various lenders. This facility has been amended several times and currently consists of the Senior Secured Term Loan B-6, Senior Secured Term Loan B-5, Senior Secured Term Loan A-3 (collectively, the Senior Secured Term Loans\u201d), and the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn December 1, 2021, we entered into an agreement to amend certain provisions of the Senior Secured Credit Facility and exercise our right to draw additional debt in an amount of $3,100.0 million, less original issue discount and deferred financing fees of $7.8 million and $43.6 million, respectively. Proceeds from the incremental loan on the Senior Secured Credit Facility were used to fund the acquisition of Neustar.\nIn addition, on December 1, 2021, we entered into a Second Lien Credit Agreement to obtain term loans in an aggregate amount of $640.0 million, less original issue discount and deferred financing fees of $3.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively, used for the acquisition of Sontiq. On December 23, 2021, we fully repaid the Second Lien Term Loan using a portion of the proceeds from our sale of the Healthcare business.\nHedges\nOn December 23, 2021, we entered into new interest rate swap agreements with various counter-parties that effectively fix our LIBOR exposure on a portion of our Senior Secured Term Loan or similar replacement debt. The new swaps commenced on December 31, 2021, and expires on December 31, 2026, with a current aggregate notional amount of $1,600.0 million that amortizes each quarter. The new swaps require TransUnion to pay fixed rates varying between 1.4280% and 1.4360% in exchange for receiving a variable rate that matches the variable rate on our loans. We have designated these swap agreements as cash flow hedges.\nOn March 10, 2020, we entered into two tranches of interest rate swap agreements with various counter-parties that effectively fix our LIBOR exposure on a portion of our Senior Secured Term Loans or similar replacement debt. The first swap commenced on June 30, 2020, and expires on June 30, 2022, with a current aggregate notional amount of $1,120.0 million that amortizes each quarter. The first swap requires TransUnion to pay fixed rates varying between 0.5200% and 0.5295% in exchange for receiving a variable rate that matches the variable rate on our loans. The second swap commences on June 30, 2022, and expires on June 30, 2025, with a current aggregate notional amount of $1,110.0 million that amortizes each quarter after it commences. The second swap requires TransUnion to pay fixed rates varying between 0.9125% and 0.9280% in exchange for receiving a variable rate that matches the variable rate on our loans. We have designated these swap agreements as cash flow hedges.\nOn December 17, 2018, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with various counter-parties that effectively fix our LIBOR exposure on a portion of our Senior Secured Term Loans or similar replacement debt, which is currently fixed at 2.702% and 2.706%. We have designated these swap agreements as cash flow hedges. The current aggregate notional amount under these agreements is $1,390.0 million, decreasing each quarter until the second agreement terminates on December 30, 2022.\nEffect of certain debt covenants\nA breach of any of the covenants under the agreements governing our debt could limit our ability to borrow funds under the senior secured revolving line of credit and could result in a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior secured credit facility, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding to be immediately due and payable, and the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay the amounts declared due, the lenders could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.\nWith certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Credit Facility obligations are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Trans Union LLC, including its investment in subsidiaries. The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains various restrictions and nonfinancial covenants, along with a senior secured net leverage ratio test. The nonfinancial covenants include restrictions on dividends, investments, dispositions, future borrowings and other specified payments, as well\nas additional reporting and disclosure requirements. The senior secured net leverage test must be met as a condition to incur additional indebtedness, make certain investments, and may be required to make certain restricted payments. The senior secured net leverage ratio must not exceed 5.5-to-1 at any such measurement date. Under the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, TransUnion may make dividend payments up to the greater of $100 million or 10.0% of Consolidated EBITDA per year, or an unlimited amount provided that no default or event of default exists and so long as the total net leverage ratio does not exceed 4.75-to-1. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nOur ability to meet our liquidity needs or to pay dividends on our common stock depends on our subsidiaries' earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, and other contractual restrictions.\nFor additional information about our debt and hedge, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt.\u201d\nContractual Obligations\nRefer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 12, Debt,\u201d Note 13, Leases\u201d and Note 21, Commitments,\u201d for information about our long-term debt obligations, noncancelable lease obligations, and noncancelable purchase obligations as of December 31, 2021.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d Note 1, Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies,\u201d for additional information about our significant accounting and reporting policies that require us to make certain judgements and estimates in reporting our operating results and our assets and liabilities. The following paragraphs describe the accounting policies that require significant judgment and estimates due to inherent uncertainty or complexity.\nGoodwill\nAs of December 31, 2021, our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $5,525.7 million. As of December 31, 2021, we did not have any other indefinite-lived intangible assets. We conduct an impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired.\nWe have the option to first perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the qualitative analysis indicates that an impairment is more likely than not for any reporting unit, we perform a quantitative impairment analysis for that reporting unit. We have the option to bypass the qualitative analysis for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing a quantitative analysis.\nOur quantitative analysis consists of a fair value calculation for each reporting unit that combines an income approach, using the discounted cash flow method, and a market approach, using the guideline public company method. The quantitative impairment analysis requires the application of a number of significant assumptions, including estimates of future revenue growth rates, EBITDA margins, discount rates, and market multiples. The projected future revenue and EBITDA margins, and the resulting projected cash flows of each reporting unit is based on internal operating plans reviewed by management, extrapolated over the forecast period. The discount rate for each reporting unit is based on the weighted average cost of capital for the reporting unit. Market multiples are based on the Guideline Public Company Method using comparable publicly traded company multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization for a group of benchmark companies.\nWe believe the assumptions we use in our qualitative and quantitative analysis are reasonable and consistent with assumptions that would be used by other marketplace participants. In order to ensure the assumptions used in the analysis are reasonable, we compare the sum of the fair value of the reporting units to our market capitalization, to ensure it is within a reasonable range. However, such assumptions are inherently uncertain, and a change in assumptions could change the estimated fair values of our reporting units and, therefore, future impairment charges could be required, which could be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2021, we elected to bypass the qualitative goodwill impairment analysis, and instead performed a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for all reporting units. For each of our reporting units, the fair value exceeded the carrying value and no impairment was recorded. Further, a 10% decrease in the estimated cash flows or a 10% increase in the discount rate, combined with a 10% decrease in the market multiple would not result in an impairment for any of our reporting units. Our reporting units that have longer operating histories have greater headroom compared with reporting units that include significant recent acquisitions.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the acquisitions of Neustar for $3,106.6 million in cash, subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments, and Sontiq for $642.8 million in cash, subject to certain customary purchase price\nadjustments. These transactions were accounted for as business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination generally be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The determination of fair value requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been recorded as goodwill.\nThe valuations of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have not yet been finalized as of December 31, 2021. The purchase price allocations are preliminary and subject to change, including the valuation of intangible assets, income taxes and goodwill, among other items. The fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 31, 2021 are based on management's best estimates and assumptions as of the reporting date.\nIn determining the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets, we utilized various forms of the income approach, depending on the asset being valued. The estimation of fair value requires significant judgment related to cash flow forecasts, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in each cash flow stream, competitive trends, market comparables and other factors. Other inputs included historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, and growth rates.\nThe intangible assets were valued using the following valuation approaches:\nCustomer Relationships\nWe valued customer relationships using the multi-period excess-earnings method, a form of the income approach, which required the application of judgment for significant assumptions. Significant assumptions include customer attrition rates, EBITDA margins, and discount rates.\nTechnology and software\nWe valued the developed technology using the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach, which required the application of judgment for significant assumptions. Significant assumptions include the royalty rate, economic depreciation factors, and discount rates.\nOther identifiable intangible assets\nOther identifiable intangible assets include trade names and trademarks and non-compete agreements for key employees, which are not material. Trade names and trademarks were valued using the relief from royalty method and non-compete agreements were valued using the lost income method.\nWe engaged a third-party valuation specialist to assist in our analysis of the fair value of the acquired intangibles. All judgements, significant assumptions and estimates, and forecasts were either provided by or reviewed by us. While we chose to utilize a third-party valuation specialist for assistance, the fair value analysis and related valuations reflect the conclusions of management and not those of any third party. We believe the judgements and assumptions we have used are reasonable and consistent with assumptions that would be used by other marketplace participants. However such assumptions are inherently uncertain, and a change in assumptions could change the estimated fair values of the intangible assets which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are routinely named as defendants in, or parties to, various legal actions and proceedings relating to our current or past business operations. These actions generally assert claims for violations of federal or state credit reporting, consumer protection or privacy laws, or common law claims related to the unfair treatment of consumers, and may include claims for substantial or indeterminate compensatory or punitive damages, or injunctive relief, and may seek business practice changes. We believe that most of these claims are either without merit or we have valid defenses to the claims, and we vigorously defend these matters or seek non-monetary or small monetary settlements, if possible. However, due to the uncertainties inherent in litigation, we cannot predict the outcome of each claim in each instance.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we also are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal), certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. In connection with formal and informal inquiries by these regulators, we routinely receive requests, subpoenas and orders seeking documents, testimony, and other information in connection with various aspects of our activities.\nIn view of the inherent unpredictability of legal and regulatory matters, particularly where the damages sought are substantial or indeterminate or when the proceedings or investigations are in the early stages, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty the timing or ultimate resolution of legal and regulatory matters or the eventual loss, fines or penalties, if any, that may result. We establish reserves for legal and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and can be reasonably estimated. However, for certain of the matters, we are not able to reasonably estimate our exposure because damages have not been specified and (i) the proceedings are in early stages, (ii) there is uncertainty as to the\nlikelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (iii) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of similar matters pending against our competitors, (iv) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (v) there are legal issues of a first impression being presented. The actual costs of resolving legal and regulatory matters, however, may be substantially higher than the amounts reserved for those matters, and an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in particular quarterly or annual periods. We accrue amounts for certain legal and regulatory matters for which losses were considered to be probable of occurring based on our best estimate of the most likely outcome. It is reasonably possible actual losses could be significantly different from our current estimates. In addition, there are some matters for which it is reasonably possible that a loss will occur, however we cannot estimate a range of the potential losses for these matters. Legal fees incurred in connection with ongoing litigation are considered a period cost and are expensed as incurred.\nTo reduce our exposure to an unexpected significant monetary award resulting from an adverse judicial decision, we maintain insurance that we believe is appropriate and adequate based on our historical experience. We regularly advise our insurance carriers of the claims (threatened or pending) against us in the course of litigation and generally receive a reservation of rights letter from the carriers when such claims exceed applicable deductibles. We are not aware of any significant monetary claim that has been asserted against us in the course of pending litigation that would not have some level of coverage by insurance after the relevant deductible, if any, is met.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we accrued $85.6 million and $76.0 million, respectively, for anticipated claims. These amounts were recorded in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and the associated expenses were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Legal fees incurred in connection with ongoing litigation are considered period costs and are expensed as incurred.\nSee Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 22, Contingencies,\u201d for further information.\nIncome Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2021, our consolidated balance sheet included non-current deferred tax liabilities of $787.6 million. Certain deferred tax assets, including net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards, may be deducted from future taxable income in computing our federal income tax liability. Our deferred tax liability includes deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, temporary differences, and unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions.\nWe have made certain judgments and estimates to determine various tax amounts recorded, including future tax rates, future taxable income, whether it is more likely than not a tax position will be sustained, and the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit to record. We have deferred tax assets related to loss and credit carryforwards of $169.0 million, net of valuation allowances of $70.8 million. Our estimate of the amount of the deferred tax asset we can realize requires significant assumptions about projected revenues and income that are impacted by future market and economic conditions. We believe the judgments and estimates used are reasonable, but events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of tax audits may differ significantly from what is expected.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information about recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and
