Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future, and our interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results we expect for the full fiscal year or any other period.\nOverview\nSailPoint is the leading provider of enterprise identity governance solutions. Our open identity platform provides organizations with critical visibility into who currently has access to which resources, who should have access to those resources, and how that access is being used.\nWe offer both on-premises software and cloud-based solutions, which empower our customers to efficiently and securely govern the digital identities of employees, contractors, business partners and other users, and manage their constantly changing access rights to enterprise applications and data across hybrid IT environments, whether comprised of on-premises, cloud or mobile applications. We help customers enable their businesses with more agile and innovative IT, enhance their security posture and better meet compliance and regulatory requirements. We believe that our open identity platform is a critical, foundational layer of a modern cyber security strategy that complements and builds upon traditional perimeter- and endpoint-centric security solutions, which on their own are increasingly insufficient to secure organizations, and their applications and data. Our customers include many of the world's largest and most complex organizations, including commercial enterprises, educational institutions and governments.\nWe were founded by identity industry veterans to develop a new category of identity management solutions and address emerging identity governance challenges. Since our inception, we have focused on driving innovation in the identity market, with our key milestones including:\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> in 2007, we pioneered identity governance through our release of IdentityIQ, our on-premises identity governance solution;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> in 2010, we revolutionized provisioning by integrating it with IdentityIQ into a single solution;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> in 2013, we introduced our cloud-based identity governance solution, IdentityNow;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> in 2015, we extended identity governance by adding our identity governance for data stored in files solution, SecurityIQ, which manages user access to unstructured data, a rapidly growing area of risk; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> in 2017, we further extended identity governance with the introduction of our advanced identity analytics solution, IdentityAI, which is designed to use machine learning technologies to enable rapid detection of security threats before they turn into security breaches.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur solutions address the complex needs of global enterprises and mid-market organizations. As of December 31, 2017, 933 customers across a wide variety of industries were using our products to enable and secure digital identities across the globe. No single customer represented more than 10% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nOur revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 36% from the year ended December 31, 2012 to the year ended December 31, 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our revenue was $186.1 million, $132.4 million, and $95.4 million, respectively. During such periods, purchase accounting adjustments related to the Acquisition reduced our revenue by $0.1 million, $1.4 million and $5.6 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our net loss was $7.6 million, $3.2 million, and $10.8 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our net cash provided by operations was $21.9 million, $6.5 million, and $3.6 million, respectively.\nOur success is principally dependent on our ability to deliver compelling solutions to attract new customers and retain existing customers. Delivering these solutions is challenging because our customers have large, complex IT environments, often rely on both legacy and innovative technologies, and deploy different business models, including on premise and cloud solutions. Rising security threats and evolving regulations and compliance standards for cyber security, data protection, privacy and internal IT controls create new opportunities for our industry and require us to adapt our solutions to be successful. Our ability to continue to maintain our historical growth rates is also challenging because our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our global presence and invest in new vertical markets, while competing against much larger companies with more recognizable brands and financial resources. Although we seek to grow rapidly, we also focus on delivering positive net cash from operations while continuing to invest in our platform and to deliver innovative solutions to our customers. Additionally, our gross margins vary depending on the type of solution we sell, and a shift in the mix of our solutions could affect our performance relative to historical results.\nOur Business Model\nWe deliver an integrated set of solutions that supports all aspects of identity governance, including provisioning, access request, compliance controls, password management and identity governance for data stored in files. Our solutions are built on an open identity platform, which offers connectivity to a variety of security and operational IT applications, extending the reach of our identity governance processes and enabling effective identity governance controls across customer environments.\nOur set of solutions currently consists of (i) IdentityIQ, our on-premises identity governance solution, (ii) IdentityNow, our cloud-based, multi-tenant governance suite, which is delivered as a subscription service, and (iii) SecurityIQ, our on-premises identity governance for files solution that secures access to data stored in file servers, collaboration portals, mailboxes and cloud storage systems, and (iv) IdentityAI, our cloud-based advanced identity analytics solution. See in Part I - Item 1, the section titled Business-Products\u201d for more information regarding our solutions.\nFor our IdentityIQ and SecurityIQ solutions, our customers typically purchase a perpetual software license, which includes one year of maintenance. Our maintenance provides software maintenance as well as access to our technical support services during the maintenance term. After the initial maintenance period, customers with perpetual licenses may renew their maintenance agreement for an additional fee. For our cloud-based solutions, IdentityNow and IdentityAI, for a subscription fee, we offer customers access to this solution and infrastructure support for the duration of their subscription agreement. Our standard subscription agreement for our IdentityNow solution has a duration of three years.\nPricing for each of our solutions is dependent on the number of digital identities of employees, contractors, business partners and other users that the customer is entitled to govern with the solution. We also package and price our IdentityIQ and IdentityNow solutions into modules. Each module has unique functionalities, and our IdentityIQ and IdentityNow customers are able to purchase one or more modules, depending on their needs. We package and price SecurityIQ, our identity governance for files solution, by target storage systems. Thus, our revenue from any customer is generally determined by the number of identities that the customer is entitled to govern as well as the number of modules (for our IdentityIQ and IdentityNow solutions) or target storage systems (for our SecurityIQ solution) purchased by the customer.\nOur go-to-market strategy consists of both direct sales and indirect sales through our partnership network of systems integrators, value-added resellers and adjacent technology vendors. We work closely with systems integrators, many of whom have dedicated SailPoint practices (including Accenture, Deloitte, KPMG and PwC), with some dating back more than seven years, and resellers (including value-added resellers such as Optiv) to identify potential sales opportunities and help us increase our reach, and we frequently cooperate with systems integrators to make joint sales proposals to address our mutual customers' requirements. We also collaborate with leading access management vendors by adding our identity governance capabilities to their access management services (e.g., Microsoft, Okta and VMware). We do not have any material payment obligations to systems integrators, resellers or our technology partners; nor do they have any material payment obligations to us, except that resellers typically purchase solutions directly from us and resell to customers. See the section titled Business-Partnerships and Strategic Relationships\u201d for more information regarding our partnership network.\nIn addition to our solutions, we offer professional services to our customers and partners to configure and optimize the use of our solutions as well as training services related to the configuration and operation of our platform. Most of our professional services activity is in support of our partners, who perform a significant majority of all initial and follow-on implementation work for our customers. Most of our consulting services are priced on a time and materials basis; our training services are provided through multiple pricing models, including on a per-person basis (for courses provided at our headquarters and on-site at our customers' offices) and a flat-rate basis (for our e-learning course).\nWe devote significant resources to acquire new customers, in both existing and new markets, in order to grow our customer base. In addition, we focus on three distinct opportunities to increase sales to existing customers: (i) expand the number of digital identities; (ii) up-sell additional modules or target storage systems, as applicable, within a single solution; and (iii) cross-sell additional solutions.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nOur historical financial performance has been, and we expect our financial performance in the future to be, driven by our ability to:\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Add New Customers Within Existing Markets. Based on data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, we believe that we have penetrated less than 2% of the approximately 65,000 companies in the countries where we have customers today and that as a result, there is significant opportunity to expand our footprint in our existing markets through new, greenfield installations and displacement of our competitors' legacy solutions. To do so, we plan to grow our sales organization, increase and leverage our indirect channel partners and enhance our marketing efforts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Generate Additional Sales to Existing Customers. We believe that our existing customer base provides us with a significant opportunity to drive incremental sales. In most cases, our customers initially purchase a subset of the modules or solutions we offer based on their immediate need. We focus on generating more revenue from the modules that our customers have already purchased from us as our customers grow the number of identities our solutions manage and govern and as our customers deploy our solutions across other business units or geographies within their organizations. Over time, we also identify up-selling and cross-selling opportunities and seek to sell additional modules and solutions to our existing customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Retain Customers. We believe that our ability to retain our customers is an important component of our growth strategy and reflects the long-term value of our customer relationships. For example, when we add a new customer, we generate new license revenue. If the customer renews, we generate incremental maintenance revenue. As we add new IdentityIQ customers, our high renewal rates result in incremental maintenance revenue. Our key strategies to maintain our high renewal rates include focusing on the quality and reliability of our solutions, customer service and support to ensure our customers receive value from our solutions, providing consistent software upgrades and having dedicated customer success teams.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expand into New Markets. We expect to continue to invest significantly in sales, marketing and customer service, as well as our indirect channel partner network, to expand into new geographies and vertical markets. We believe that our market opportunity is large and growing and that the global cyber security market represents a significant growth opportunity for us. In 2017, we generated only 28% of our revenue outside of the United States.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Business Metrics\nIn addition to our GAAP financial information, we monitor the following key metrics to help us measure and evaluate the effectiveness of our operations:\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Number of Customers. We believe that the size of our customer base is an indicator of our market penetration and that our net customer additions are an indicator of the growth of our business and our future revenue opportunity. We define a customer as a distinct entity, division or business unit of an organization that receives support or has the right to use our cloud-based solutions as of the specified measurement date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Subscription Revenue as a Percentage of Total Revenue. Subscription revenue is a portion of our total revenue and is derived from (i) IdentityNow, our cloud-based solution where customers enter into SaaS subscription agreements with us, and (ii) IdentityIQ and SecurityIQ maintenance and support agreements, but not licenses. As we generally sell our solutions on a per-identity basis, our subscription revenue for any customer is primarily determined by the number of identities that the customer is entitled to govern as part of a SaaS subscription, and the ongoing price paid per-identity under a maintenance and support agreement or SaaS subscription. Thus, we consider our subscription revenue to be the recurring portion of our revenue base and believe that its continued growth as a percentage of total revenue will lead to a more predictable revenue model and increase our visibility to future period total revenues. Because we recognize our subscription revenue ratably over the duration of those agreements, a portion of the revenue we recognize each period is derived from agreements we entered into in prior periods. In contrast, we typically recognize license revenue upon entering into the applicable license, the timing of which is less predictable and may cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial results.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is a measure widely used by securities analysts and investors to evaluate the financial performance of our company and other companies. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is an important measure for evaluating our performance because it facilitates comparisons of our core operating results from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (net interest income or expense from our outstanding debt), asset base (depreciation and amortization), tax consequences, purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition and sponsor related costs and stock-based compensation. In addition, we base certain of our forward-looking estimates and budgets on adjusted EBITDA. See the section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for more information regarding adjusted EBITDA, including the limitations of using adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure, and for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures to clarify and enhance our understanding of past performance and future prospects. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance, financial position or cash flow that includes or excludes amounts that are included or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. As discussed below, we monitor the non-GAAP financial measures described below, and we believe they are helpful to investors.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry because they may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. In particular, interest expense, which is excluded from adjusted EBITDA has been and will continue to be a significant recurring expense in our business for the foreseeable future. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We urge you to review the reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nWe exclude stock-based compensation expense because it is non-cash in nature and excluding this expense provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and allows investors the ability to make more meaningful comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies. We also exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, the partial release of the valuation allowance due to acquisition, facility exit costs, and make adjustments related to a financing lease obligation from our non-GAAP financial measures because these are considered by management to be outside of our core operating results. Accordingly, we believe that excluding these expenses provides investors and management with greater visibility to the underlying performance of our business operations and may also facilitate comparison with the results of other companies in our industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation and amortization, purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition and sponsor related costs and stock-based compensation expense.\nWe believe that adjusted EBITDA is a measure widely used by securities analysts and investors to evaluate the financial performance of our company and other companies. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is an important measure for evaluating our performance because it facilitates comparisons of our core operating results from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (net interest income or expense from our outstanding debt), asset base (depreciation and amortization), tax consequences, purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition and sponsor related costs and stock-based compensation. In addition, we base certain of our forward-looking estimates and budgets on adjusted EBITDA.\nThe following table reflects the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for the years

We generate license revenue through the sale of our on premises software license agreements. License transactions generally include an amount for first-year maintenance, which we recognize as subscription revenue. We typically recognize license revenue upon delivering the applicable license, assuming all revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. See the section titled -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Revenue Recognition\u201d for more information. Over time, we expect license revenue to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue as we continue to focus on increasing our subscription revenue as a key strategic priority.\nSubscription Revenue. Our subscription revenue consists of fees for (i) ongoing maintenance and support of our licensed solutions and (ii) subscription fees for access to, and related support for, our cloud-based solution. We typically invoice subscription fees in advance, in annual installments, and recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the applicable agreement, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. See the section titled -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Revenue Recognition\u201d for more information. Over time, we expect subscription revenue will increase as a percentage of total revenue as we continue to focus on increasing subscription revenue as a key strategic priority. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our subscription revenue was impacted by purchase accounting adjustments to deferred revenue from the Acquisition. See the section titled -Impact of Purchase Accounting.\u201d\nServices and Other Revenue. Services and other revenue consists primarily of fees from professional services provided to our customers and partners to configure and optimize the use of our solutions as well as training services related to the configuration and operation of our platform. Most of our professional services are priced on a time and materials basis, and we generally invoice customers monthly as the work is performed. We generally have standalone value for our professional services and recognize revenue as services are performed based on an estimated fair value as a separate unit of accounting. See the section titled -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Revenue Recognition\u201d for more information. Most of our professional services activity is in support of our partners, who perform the significant majority of all initial and follow-on configuration and optimization work\nfor our customers. Over time, we expect our professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue to decline as we increasingly rely on partners to help our customers deploy our software. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, our services and other revenue was impacted by purchase accounting adjustments to deferred revenue from the Acquisition. See the section titled -Impact of Purchase Accounting.\u201d\nImpact of Purchase Accounting. On September 8, 2014, SailPoint Technologies Holdings, Inc. acquired all of the capital stock of SailPoint Technologies, Inc. We refer to this transaction as the Acquisition. As a result of the Acquisition, we applied purchase accounting and a new basis of accounting beginning on the date of the Acquisition. As such, we were required by GAAP to record all assets and liabilities, including deferred revenue and long-lived assets, at fair value as of the effective date of the Acquisition, which in some cases was different than their historical book values. This had the effect of reducing revenue and deferred revenue and increasing cost of revenue from that which would have otherwise been recognized, as described in more detail below.\nWe assessed the fair value of deferred revenue acquired in the Acquisition to be $10.2 million, representing a decrease of $12.6 million from its historical book value. Recognizing deferred revenue at fair value reduces revenue in the periods subsequent to the Acquisition. The impact of the Acquisition to revenue was $0.1 million, $1.4 million and $5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effect of the Acquisition on the deferred costs was not material.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of License Revenue. Cost of license revenue consists of amortization expense for developed technology acquired in business combinations and third-party royalties.\nCost of Subscription Revenue. Cost of subscription revenue consists primarily of employee compensation cost (which consists of salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation), costs of our customer support organization, contractor costs to supplement our staff levels, allocated overhead, amortization expense for developed technology acquired in business combinations and third-party cloud-based hosting costs.\nCost of Services and Other Revenue. Cost of services and other revenue consists primarily of employee compensation costs of our professional services and training organizations, travel-related costs, contractor costs to supplement our staff levels and allocated overhead.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit is revenue less cost of revenue, and gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of revenue. Gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including the mix of our license, subscription, and services and other revenue, the costs associated with third-party cloud-based hosting services for our cloud-based subscriptions, and the extent to which we expand our customer support and services organizations. We expect that our overall gross margin will fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these various factors. Also, we expect our investment in technology to expand the capability of our services, enabling us to improve our gross margin over time.\nLicense Gross Margin. License gross margin is primarily affected by the cost of third-party royalties and amortization of developed technology acquired in business combinations, neither of which are expected to fluctuate materially from period to period in the near term.\nSubscription Gross Margin. Subscription gross margin is primarily affected by the growth in our subscription revenue as compared to the growth in, and timing of, cost of subscription revenue. Subscription gross margin is lower than our license gross margin due to, among other things, costs associated with our customer support organization and the costs associated with our cloud-based solution. We expect to continue to grow our subscription revenue, and the timing and rate of that growth might cause subscription gross margins to fluctuate in the near term then improve over time as we expect to see the benefits of scale in the infrastructure investments related to our cloud-based solution.\nServices and Other Gross Margin. Services and other gross margin is impacted by the number of customers using our professional services, the hourly rate we are able to charge for our services and the mix of services provided. Services and other gross margin is lower than our license gross margin and our subscription gross margin due to, among other things, costs associated with our professional services and training organizations.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs, allocated overhead and software and maintenance expenses, which includes cloud-based hosting costs related to the development of our cloud-based solution. We believe that continued investment in our offerings is vital to the growth of our business, and we intend to continue to invest in product development and in SailPoint Labs, our dedicated, stand-alone technology investigation and engineering group, to continue to innovate and offer our customers new solutions and to enhance our existing solutions as our business grows. See the section titled Business-Research and Development\u201d for more information. We expect such investment to increase on a dollar basis as our business grows.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs for corporate personnel, such as those in our executive, human resource, facilities, accounting and finance and information technology departments. In addition, general and administrative expenses include third-party professional fees and sponsor-related costs, as well as all other supporting corporate expenses not allocated to other departments. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase on a dollar basis as our business grows. Also, following the completion of our initial public offering in November 2017, we incur increased general and administrative expenses as a result of becoming a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, and increased expenses for insurance, investor relations and professional services.\nSales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs, sales commissions, costs of general marketing and promotional activities, travel-related expenses and allocated overhead. Sales commissions earned by our sales force on subscription contracts are deferred and amortized over the same period that revenue is recognized for the applicable contract. We expect to continue to invest in our sales force for expansion to new geographic and vertical markets. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase on a dollar basis and continue to be our largest operating expense category for the foreseeable future.\nAllocated Overhead. We allocate shared costs, such as facilities costs (including rent and utilities), information technology costs and recruiting costs, to all departments based on headcount. As such, allocated shared costs are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net consists primarily of interest expense and foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to the impact of transactions denominated in a foreign currency. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies has increased, and we expect this to continue. Interest expense, net of interest income, consists primarily of interest on our term loan facility, amortization of debt issuance costs, loss on the modification and partial extinguishment of debt and prepayment penalties.\nIncome Tax Expense\nProvision for income taxes consists of U.S. and state income taxes and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We have a full valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, and tax credits related primarily to research and development for our operations in the United States. We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance for the foreseeable future.\nOur income tax rate varies from the federal statutory rate due to the valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets and foreign withholding taxes; changing tax laws, regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate; changes to the financial accounting rules for income taxes; unanticipated changes in tax rates; differences in accounting and tax treatment of our stock-based compensation and the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions. We expect this fluctuation in income tax rates, as well as its potential impact on our results of operations, to continue.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of

License revenue increased by $24.8 million, or 46%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Although license revenue from new customers was greater than license revenue from existing customers for December 31, 2017 and 2016, the increase in total license revenue was primarily attributable to follow-on sales to our existing customers. During the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 revenue from new customers was $48.4 million and $42.2 million and license revenue from existing customers was $30.8 million and $12.2 million, respectively. Our revenue from any single customer is determined by the number of identities the customer is entitled to govern as well as the number of modules and solutions purchased.\nSubscription Revenue. Subscription revenue increased by $21.6 million, or 44%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in ongoing maintenance renewals and an increase in maintenance revenue derived from new licenses. Our customer base increased by 238, or 34%, from 695 customers at December 31, 2016 to 933 customers at December 31, 2017. Approximately $1.2 million of the increase in subscription revenue is the result of a decrease in the purchase accounting write down of deferred revenue subsequent to the Acquisition.\nServices and Other Revenue. Services and other revenue increased by $7.2 million, or 25%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily a result of an increase in the number of customers using our consulting and training services.\nGeographic Regions. Our operations in the United States were responsible for the largest portion of our revenue in each year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 because of our larger and more established sales force and partner network in the United States as compared to our other regions. Revenue from both Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA\u201d) and the rest of the world also increased for years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, primarily due to our investment in increasing the size of our international sales force and strengthening partnerships with global system integrators and resellers worldwide.\nThe following table sets forth, for each of the periods presented, our consolidated total revenue by geography and the respective percentage of total revenue:\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nrevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nrevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 134,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 92,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EMEA (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rest of the World (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 186,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 132,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> No single country represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Revenue\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> variance $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> variance %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Licenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscription\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of License Revenue.

Research and development expenses increased by $4.4 million, or 22%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Approximately $4.0 million of the increase was the result of our increased headcount, and related allocated overhead, to optimize and expand our product offerings as well as pursue innovation in identity governance. Approximately $0.5 million of the increase was the result of increased software and maintenance expenses, primarily cloud-based hosting costs related to the development of our cloud-based solution.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $2.2 million, or 30%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a $0.9 million increase in corporate staff, and related allocated overhead, to support the growth and scale of the business and a $1.3 million increase in professional service expense, including sponsor-related costs and other consulting and advisory costs.\nSales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased by $11.8 million, or 25%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Approximately $10.2 million of the increase was the result of our increased sales and marketing headcount, and related allocated overhead, to support increased penetration into our existing customer base as well as expansion into new industry verticals and geographic markets. Also contributing to the increase in sales and marketing expenses was a $1.6 million increase in expenses related to advertising and marketing programs and a $1.3 million increase in travel expenses, partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in consulting costs, and a $0.6 million decrease in amortization expense.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net increased by $0.8 million, or 55%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, increased by $3.4 million, or 87%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was the result of our entry into a new credit facility, effective in August of 2016, which increased the stated interest rate from 3.7% to 9.0%.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for each of the quarters indicated.

Revenue\nOur quarterly license revenue increased sequentially within each calendar year presented; however, we experienced a decline sequentially from the fourth quarter of each year to the first quarter of the subsequent year due to increased customer purchasing activity in each fourth quarter. We continue to experience growth in license revenue when comparing similar periods year over year as a result of our ability to attract new customers and expand our product offerings within our existing customer base.\nOur quarterly subscription revenue increased in each period presented primarily due to increases in maintenance renewals as a result of our expanding licensed customer base. Sales of subscriptions to our platform also continue to grow as a result of the expanding breadth and functionality of our platform, increasing brand awareness, and the success of our sales efforts with new and existing customers. We recognize revenue from maintenance and subscription fees ratably over the term of the contract period; therefore, changes in our sales activity in a period may not be as apparent as a change to our revenue until future periods.\nOur quarterly services and other revenue increased sequentially in each period presented. We have experienced increasing demand for our consulting and training services as our customer base, including both licensed and recurring, has continued to expand.\nQuarterly Trends in Operating Expenses\nOur operating expenses have generally increased sequentially as a result of our growth and are primarily related to increases in personnel-related costs to support our expanded operations and our continued investment in our platform infrastructure and service capabilities.\nQuarterly Key Business Metrics\nTable 254: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9/30/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6/30/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12/31/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9/30/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6/30/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3/31/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $116.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.4 million of availability under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $3.2 million of cash and cash equivalents held in our foreign subsidiaries. We do not consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, with the exception of India, to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions and have consistently applied Section 956 of the Internal Revenue Code to such earnings. As a result of applying Section 956 consistently to our intercompany cash flows, the majority of the earnings in our foreign subsidiaries represent income that was previously taxed in the United States. As a result, there would be no material income tax consequences to repatriating the cash currently held in our foreign subsidiaries. In India, we continue to invest and grow our research and development activities and have no plans to repatriate undistributed earning held in India back to the U.S. parent company, and therefore consider earnings in India to be permanently reinvested.\nWe believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, any positive cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the continued expansion of sales and marketing activities and the introduction of new solutions and product enhancements. To the extent existing cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facility are not sufficient to fund future activities, we may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness may have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict operations. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Although we are not currently a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, services or technologies, we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future, which could also require us to seek additional equity financing, incur indebtedness, or use cash resources. We have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any such acquisitions. Also, as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures.\nSince inception, we have financed operations primarily through license fees, maintenance fees, subscription fees, consulting and training fees, borrowings under our credit facility and, to a lesser degree, the sale of equity securities. Our principal uses of cash are funding operations and capital expenditures. Over the past several years, revenue has increased significantly from year to year and, as a result, cash flows from customer collections have increased. However, operating expenses have also increased as we have invested in growing our business. Our operating cash requirements may increase in the future as we continue to invest in the strategic growth of our company.\nOur Credit Facility\nOn August 16, 2016, we entered into a senior secured credit facility (our credit facility\u201d), consisting of a $115 million term loan facility and a $5 million revolving credit facility, pursuant to a credit and guaranty agreement by and among SailPoint Technologies, Inc., as the borrower, and SailPoint Technologies Intermediate Holdings, LLC and SailPoint International, Inc., as guarantors, the lenders party thereto from time to time and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as administrative agent and collateral agent, which was subsequently amended and restated on November 2, 2016 to provide for a letter of credit sub-facility with an aggregate limit equal to the lesser of $5 million and the aggregate unused amount of the revolving commitments then in effect. Our credit facility was further amended on June 28, 2017 to provide for (i) an increase to the term loan facility in an additional principal amount of $50 million to partially fund a $50.4 million dividend paid to the holders of our preferred stock and (ii) an increase to the revolving credit facility in an additional principal amount of $2.5 million, and (iii) an increase in the letter of credit sub-facility aggregate limit to the lesser of $7.5 million and the aggregate unused amount of the revolving commitments then in effect. Each of the term loan facility and revolving credit facility has a maturity of five years and will mature on August 16, 2021.\nIn fourth quarter of 2017, we amended our existing credit facility in connection with the consummation of our initial public offering. Such amendment required that we use a portion of our net proceeds from our initial public offering to repay an amount of borrowings outstanding under our term loan facility to reduce the aggregate outstanding principal amount thereof to $70.0 million (which repayment was subject to a prepayment premium of 1.50%). We used a portion of our net proceeds from our initial public offering to repay $90.0 million of such borrowings and paid the related prepayment premium of approximately $1.4 million. In addition, this payment resulted in a non-cash charge of $1.7 million on the modification and partial extinguishment of debt.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the balance outstanding under the term loan facility was $70.0 million and is included in long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. Our revolving line of credit has a face value of $7.5 million and was undrawn as of December 31, 2017. We had $1.4 million available under the revolving credit facility due to $6.1 million in standby letters of credit, issued primarily in connection with our new corporate headquarters lease. See Item 2 Properties\u201d for more information regarding our new corporate headquarters lease.\nAll of our obligations under our credit facility are guaranteed by our existing and future domestic subsidiaries and, subject to certain exceptions, secured by a security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 255: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,521\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,255\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,308\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,962\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 97,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,899\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nDuring 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $21.9 million, which consisted of a net loss of $7.6 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $17.2 million and a net change of $12.2 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges are primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $10.2 million, amortization of debt issuance costs of $0.7 million, loss on modification and partial extinguishment of debt of $1.7 million and stock-based compensation of $4.5 million. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily as a result of an increase in deferred revenue of $28.0 million due to the timing of billings and cash received in advance of revenue recognition primarily for subscription and support services, an increase in accrued expenses of $10.9 million due primarily to accrual of additional commissions and bonuses, an increase in accounts payable of $1.4 million due to timing of cash disbursements, an increase in income taxes payable of $0.6 million, partially offset by an increase in prepayments and other assets of $2.2 million, and increase in other non-current assets of $2.5 million, and an increase in accounts receivable of $24.1 million due to the timing of receipts of payments from customers.\nDuring 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $6.5 million, which consisted of a net loss of $3.2 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $8.8 million and a net change of $0.9 million in our net operating assets and liabilities.

The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily as a result of an increase in deferred revenue of $20.2 million due to the timing of billings and cash received in advance of revenue recognition primarily for subscription and support services and an increase in accrued expenses of $1.7 million related primarily to commissions on our subscription revenue, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $17.2 million due to the timing of receipts of payments from customers, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $3.6 million due to payments for various services to be rendered in subsequent periods and a decrease in accounts payable of $0.3 million due to timing of cash disbursements.\nDuring 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 million, which consisted of a net loss of $10.8 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $6.7 million and a change of $7.7 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges are primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $9.6 million, amortization of debt issuance costs of $0.1 million, and stock-based compensation of $0.2 million, partially offset by $3.3 million in deferred taxes. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, was primarily a result of an increase in deferred revenue of $11.6 million due to the timing of billings and cash received in advance of revenue recognition primarily for subscription and support services and an increase in accrued expenses of $3.1 million related primarily to commissions on our subscription revenue, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $5.3 million due to the timing of receipts of payments from customers, an increase in prepayments and other assets of $1.1 million due to payments for various services to be rendered in subsequent periods, and an increase in accounts payable of $0.6 million due to timing of cash disbursements.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash used in investing activities was $2.5 million, consisting of $2.7 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $0.2

deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $13.3 million, proceeds from borrowing of $50.0 million, $0.4 million of the proceeds from exercise of stock options, partially offset by $90.0 million in repayments of debt, $1.4 million of debt issuance cost, $50.4 million for preferred dividend payments, $1.4 million in debt prepayment and $0.7 million in purchase of equity shares.\nDuring 2016, cash used in financing activities was $2.0 million, consisting of $3.1 million in debt issuance costs and $0.2 million for the repurchase of common and preferred stock, partially

The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, and expenses and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be effected.\nWe believe that the accounting policies associated with revenue recognition, share-based compensation and income taxes are most significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates. Therefore, these are considered to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue from the following sources: (i) fees for licenses, (ii) ongoing maintenance of our licensed products and subscription fees for access to our cloud-based offering and related support and (iii) fees for consulting with our customers on configuring and optimizing the use of our products and subscription services and training services related to the implementation and configuration of our platform.\nWe recognize revenue net of sales taxes and other applicable taxes, in accordance with GAAP, when all of the following criteria are met: there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or service has been performed, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable.\nWhen non-software arrangements involve multiple elements that qualify as separate units of accounting, we allocate revenue to each deliverable based upon its relative selling price. The estimated selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) of selling price, if available; (ii) third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d) of selling price, if VSOE of selling price is not available; or (iii) best estimate of selling price ( ESP\u201d), if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE of selling price is available. When software arrangements involve multiple elements that qualify as separate units of accounting, we allocate revenue to each element based on VSOE.\nWe frequently enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple elements or deliverables. For arrangements that include both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and separable non-software deliverables as a group based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price used for allocating revenue to the deliverables as follows: (i) VSOE, (ii) TPE and (iii) ESP. Cloud-based services, and professional services related to cloud-based services, are considered to be non-software elements in our arrangements.\nVSOE of fair value for each element is based on our standard rates charged for the product or service when such product or service is sold separately or based upon the price established by our pricing committee when that product or service is not yet being sold separately. We establish VSOE for maintenance and professional services using a bell-shaped curve\u201d approach. When applying the bell-shaped curve\u201d approach, we analyze all maintenance renewal transactions over the past 12 months for that category of license and plot those data points on a bell-shaped curve to ensure that a high percentage of the data points are within an acceptable margin of the established VSOE rate. This analysis is performed quarterly on a rolling 12-month basis.\nWhen we are unable to establish a selling price for non-software arrangements using VSOE or TPE, we use ESP in the allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy, pricing factors and analysis of historical transactions.\nRevenue for software arrangements that include undelivered elements is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements for which we have established VSOE is deferred and recognized as delivered to the customer and the remaining portion of the agreement fee is recognized as license revenue upon delivery. The determination of fair value of each undelivered element in software arrangements is based on VSOE. If VSOE has not been established for certain undelivered elements in an agreement, revenue is deferred until those elements have been delivered or their VSOE has been determined.\nRevenue from maintenance and SaaS services is recognized ratably over the relevant contract period.\nServices revenue includes fees from consulting and training services. Consulting and training services are judged to not be essential to the functionality of our software and SaaS offerings, are listed separately in arrangements, are optional, and are sold separately. As a result, the Company has established VSOE or ESP for consulting and training services and they therefore qualify for separate accounting.\nIn order to account for deliverables in some multiple-deliverable arrangements as separate units of accounting, delivered elements must have standalone value. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the software or SaaS sale, and the contractual dependence of the sale on the customer's satisfaction with the professional services. Professional services sold as part of SaaS arrangements generally qualify for separate accounting.\nConsulting and training service revenue that qualifies for separate accounting is recognized as the services are performed using the proportional performance method for fixed fee consulting contracts, or when the right to the service expires. Many of our consulting contracts are billed on a time and materials basis.\nCustomer advances and billed amounts due from customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation costs related to equity awards, including stock options and incentive units, granted based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of stock-based awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period).\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. Our assumptions are as follows:\nTable 259: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected volatility. As we have been a public company for a limited amount of time and do not have a sufficient trading history for our common stock, the expected stock price volatility for our common stock is estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for industry peers over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 260: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 261: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected dividend yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends to common stockholders and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 262: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected term. The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. As we do not have sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term of the stock option awards granted, we base our expected term for awards issued to employees or members of our board of directors on the simplified method, which represents the average period from vesting to the expiration of the stock option.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation for our equity awards. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected terms and forfeiture rates used for our stock-based compensation calculations on a prospective basis.\nWe analyze the facts and circumstances of each equity instrument to determine if modification accounting is required. This analysis includes a review of factors that influence the probability of vesting. If circumstances arise that have changed the probability that an equity instrument will vest, or other factors have triggered a modification, the revised fair value is calculated, and additional stock-based compensation is recognized over the remaining service period of the modified option.\nHistorically, for all periods prior to our initial public offering, the fair values of the shares of common stock underlying our stock-based awards were estimated on each grant date by our board of directors. In order to determine the fair value of our common stock underlying option grants, our board of directors considered, among other things, enterprise value of comparable public companies evaluated on a quarterly basis and the overall market and economic environment.\nFor stock awards after the completion of our initial public offering, our board of directors determines the fair value of each share of underlying common stock based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date of grant.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to federal, state and local taxes in the United States as well as in other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to current federal and state income tax in the United States.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions based on those positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We determine if the amount of available support indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. We then measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which such determination is made.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had deferred tax assets of approximately $5.6 million, primarily comprised of our net operating loss carryforwards. We have a full valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, and tax credits related primarily to research and development for our operations in the United States. We will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist. Any adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the periods in which the adjustment is determined to be required.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and identified net assets acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives are not be amortized, but rather tested for impairment annually, or more often if and when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We have determined that we operate as one reporting unit and may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not\u201d that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and whether the two-step impairment test on goodwill is required. Goodwill is tested using a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired, and thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test, used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. After a goodwill impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill shall be its new accounting basis. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference. There were no impairments of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, and our reporting unit is not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test.\nIn 2017, we elected to change the annual assessment date for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets from December 31st to October 31st because the change in date creates synergy and enhance the quality of our indefinite lived intangible assets impairment analysis.\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act ( JOBS\u201d) Act Accounting Election\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of all of the reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards, until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Our election to use the phase-in periods permitted by this election may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the longer phase-in periods under the JOBS Act and who will comply with new or revised financial accounting standards. If we were to subsequently elect to instead comply with these public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable pursuant to the JOBS Act.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of our recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted, see Note 2 of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future, and our interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results we expect for the full fiscal year or any other period.\nOverview\nSailPoint is the leading provider of enterprise identity governance solutions. Our open identity platform provides organizations with critical visibility into who currently has access to which resources, who should have access to those resources, and how that access is being used.\nWe offer both on-premises software and cloud-based solutions, which empower our customers to efficiently and securely govern the digital identities of employees, contractors, business partners and other users, and manage their constantly changing access rights to enterprise applications and data across hybrid IT environments, whether comprised of on-premises, cloud or mobile applications. We help customers enable their businesses with more agile and innovative IT, enhance their security posture and better meet compliance and regulatory requirements. We believe that our open identity platform is a critical, foundational layer of a modern cyber security strategy that complements and builds upon traditional perimeter- and endpoint-centric security solutions, which on their own are increasingly insufficient to secure organizations, and their applications and data. Our customers include many of the world's largest and most complex organizations, including commercial enterprises, educational institutions and governments.\nWe were founded by identity industry veterans to develop a new category of identity management solutions and address emerging identity governance challenges. Since our inception, we have focused on driving innovation in the identity market, with our key milestones including:\n \u2022 in 2007, we pioneered identity governance through our release of IdentityIQ, our on-premises identity governance solution; \n \u2022 in 2010, we revolutionized provisioning by integrating it with IdentityIQ into a single solution; \n \u2022 in 2013, we introduced our cloud-based identity governance solution, IdentityNow; \n \u2022 in 2015, we extended identity governance by adding our identity governance for data stored in files solution, SecurityIQ, which manages user access to unstructured data, a rapidly growing area of risk; and \n \u2022 in 2017, we further extended identity governance with the introduction of our advanced identity analytics solution, IdentityAI, which is designed to use machine learning technologies to enable rapid detection of security threats before they turn into security breaches. \nOur solutions address the complex needs of global enterprises and mid-market organizations. As of December 31, 2017, 933 customers across a wide variety of industries were using our products to enable and secure digital identities across the globe. No single customer represented more than 10% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nOur revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 36% from the year ended December 31, 2012 to the year ended December 31, 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our revenue was $186.1 million, $132.4 million, and $95.4 million, respectively. During such periods, purchase accounting adjustments related to the Acquisition reduced our revenue by $0.1 million, $1.4 million and $5.6 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our net loss was $7.6 million, $3.2 million, and $10.8 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our net cash provided by operations was $21.9 million, $6.5 million, and $3.6 million, respectively.\nOur success is principally dependent on our ability to deliver compelling solutions to attract new customers and retain existing customers. Delivering these solutions is challenging because our customers have large, complex IT environments, often rely on both legacy and innovative technologies, and deploy different business models, including on premise and cloud solutions. Rising security threats and evolving regulations and compliance standards for cyber security, data protection, privacy and internal IT controls create new opportunities for our industry and require us to adapt our solutions to be successful. Our ability to continue to maintain our historical growth rates is also challenging because our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our global presence and invest in new vertical markets, while competing against much larger companies with more recognizable brands and financial resources. Although we seek to grow rapidly, we also focus on delivering positive net cash from operations while continuing to invest in our platform and to deliver innovative solutions to our customers. Additionally, our gross margins vary depending on the type of solution we sell, and a shift in the mix of our solutions could affect our performance relative to historical results.\nOur Business Model\nWe deliver an integrated set of solutions that supports all aspects of identity governance, including provisioning, access request, compliance controls, password management and identity governance for data stored in files. Our solutions are built on an open identity platform, which offers connectivity to a variety of security and operational IT applications, extending the reach of our identity governance processes and enabling effective identity governance controls across customer environments.\nOur set of solutions currently consists of (i) IdentityIQ, our on-premises identity governance solution, (ii) IdentityNow, our cloud-based, multi-tenant governance suite, which is delivered as a subscription service, and (iii) SecurityIQ, our on-premises identity governance for files solution that secures access to data stored in file servers, collaboration portals, mailboxes and cloud storage systems, and (iv) IdentityAI, our cloud-based advanced identity analytics solution. See in Part I - Item 1, the section titled Business-Products\u201d for more information regarding our solutions.\nFor our IdentityIQ and SecurityIQ solutions, our customers typically purchase a perpetual software license, which includes one year of maintenance. Our maintenance provides software maintenance as well as access to our technical support services during the maintenance term. After the initial maintenance period, customers with perpetual licenses may renew their maintenance agreement for an additional fee. For our cloud-based solutions, IdentityNow and IdentityAI, for a subscription fee, we offer customers access to this solution and infrastructure support for the duration of their subscription agreement. Our standard subscription agreement for our IdentityNow solution has a duration of three years.\nPricing for each of our solutions is dependent on the number of digital identities of employees, contractors, business partners and other users that the customer is entitled to govern with the solution. We also package and price our IdentityIQ and IdentityNow solutions into modules. Each module has unique functionalities, and our IdentityIQ and IdentityNow customers are able to purchase one or more modules, depending on their needs. We package and price SecurityIQ, our identity governance for files solution, by target storage systems. Thus, our revenue from any customer is generally determined by the number of identities that the customer is entitled to govern as well as the number of modules (for our IdentityIQ and IdentityNow solutions) or target storage systems (for our SecurityIQ solution) purchased by the customer.\nOur go-to-market strategy consists of both direct sales and indirect sales through our partnership network of systems integrators, value-added resellers and adjacent technology vendors. We work closely with systems integrators, many of whom have dedicated SailPoint practices (including Accenture, Deloitte, KPMG and PwC), with some dating back more than seven years, and resellers (including value-added resellers such as Optiv) to identify potential sales opportunities and help us increase our reach, and we frequently cooperate with systems integrators to make joint sales proposals to address our mutual customers' requirements. We also collaborate with leading access management vendors by adding our identity governance capabilities to their access management services (e.g., Microsoft, Okta and VMware). We do not have any material payment obligations to systems integrators, resellers or our technology partners; nor do they have any material payment obligations to us, except that resellers typically purchase solutions directly from us and resell to customers. See the section titled Business-Partnerships and Strategic Relationships\u201d for more information regarding our partnership network.\nIn addition to our solutions, we offer professional services to our customers and partners to configure and optimize the use of our solutions as well as training services related to the configuration and operation of our platform. Most of our professional services activity is in support of our partners, who perform a significant majority of all initial and follow-on implementation work for our customers. Most of our consulting services are priced on a time and materials basis; our training services are provided through multiple pricing models, including on a per-person basis (for courses provided at our headquarters and on-site at our customers' offices) and a flat-rate basis (for our e-learning course).\nWe devote significant resources to acquire new customers, in both existing and new markets, in order to grow our customer base. In addition, we focus on three distinct opportunities to increase sales to existing customers: (i) expand the number of digital identities; (ii) up-sell additional modules or target storage systems, as applicable, within a single solution; and (iii) cross-sell additional solutions.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nOur historical financial performance has been, and we expect our financial performance in the future to be, driven by our ability to:\n \u2022 Add New Customers Within Existing Markets. Based on data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, we believe that we have penetrated less than 2% of the approximately 65,000 companies in the countries where we have customers today and that as a result, there is significant opportunity to expand our footprint in our existing markets through new, greenfield installations and displacement of our competitors' legacy solutions. To do so, we plan to grow our sales organization, increase and leverage our indirect channel partners and enhance our marketing efforts. \n \u2022 Generate Additional Sales to Existing Customers. We believe that our existing customer base provides us with a significant opportunity to drive incremental sales. In most cases, our customers initially purchase a subset of the modules or solutions we offer based on their immediate need. We focus on generating more revenue from the modules that our customers have already purchased from us as our customers grow the number of identities our solutions manage and govern and as our customers deploy our solutions across other business units or geographies within their organizations. Over time, we also identify up-selling and cross-selling opportunities and seek to sell additional modules and solutions to our existing customers. \n \u2022 Retain Customers. We believe that our ability to retain our customers is an important component of our growth strategy and reflects the long-term value of our customer relationships. For example, when we add a new customer, we generate new license revenue. If the customer renews, we generate incremental maintenance revenue. As we add new IdentityIQ customers, our high renewal rates result in incremental maintenance revenue. Our key strategies to maintain our high renewal rates include focusing on the quality and reliability of our solutions, customer service and support to ensure our customers receive value from our solutions, providing consistent software upgrades and having dedicated customer success teams. \n \u2022 Expand into New Markets. We expect to continue to invest significantly in sales, marketing and customer service, as well as our indirect channel partner network, to expand into new geographies and vertical markets. We believe that our market opportunity is large and growing and that the global cyber security market represents a significant growth opportunity for us. In 2017, we generated only 28% of our revenue outside of the United States. \nKey Business Metrics\nIn addition to our GAAP financial information, we monitor the following key metrics to help us measure and evaluate the effectiveness of our operations:\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 Number of Customers. We believe that the size of our customer base is an indicator of our market penetration and that our net customer additions are an indicator of the growth of our business and our future revenue opportunity. We define a customer as a distinct entity, division or business unit of an organization that receives support or has the right to use our cloud-based solutions as of the specified measurement date. \n \u2022 Subscription Revenue as a Percentage of Total Revenue. Subscription revenue is a portion of our total revenue and is derived from (i) IdentityNow, our cloud-based solution where customers enter into SaaS subscription agreements with us, and (ii) IdentityIQ and SecurityIQ maintenance and support agreements, but not licenses. As we generally sell our solutions on a per-identity basis, our subscription revenue for any customer is primarily determined by the number of identities that the customer is entitled to govern as part of a SaaS subscription, and the ongoing price paid per-identity under a maintenance and support agreement or SaaS subscription. Thus, we consider our subscription revenue to be the recurring portion of our revenue base and believe that its continued growth as a percentage of total revenue will lead to a more predictable revenue model and increase our visibility to future period total revenues. Because we recognize our subscription revenue ratably over the duration of those agreements, a portion of the revenue we recognize each period is derived from agreements we entered into in prior periods. In contrast, we typically recognize license revenue upon entering into the applicable license, the timing of which is less predictable and may cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is a measure widely used by securities analysts and investors to evaluate the financial performance of our company and other companies. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is an important measure for evaluating our performance because it facilitates comparisons of our core operating results from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (net interest income or expense from our outstanding debt), asset base (depreciation and amortization), tax consequences, purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition and sponsor related costs and stock-based compensation. In addition, we base certain of our forward-looking estimates and budgets on adjusted EBITDA. See the section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for more information regarding adjusted EBITDA, including the limitations of using adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure, and for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures to clarify and enhance our understanding of past performance and future prospects. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance, financial position or cash flow that includes or excludes amounts that are included or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. As discussed below, we monitor the non-GAAP financial measures described below, and we believe they are helpful to investors.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry because they may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. In particular, interest expense, which is excluded from adjusted EBITDA has been and will continue to be a significant recurring expense in our business for the foreseeable future. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We urge you to review the reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nWe exclude stock-based compensation expense because it is non-cash in nature and excluding this expense provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and allows investors the ability to make more meaningful comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies. We also exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, the partial release of the valuation allowance due to acquisition, facility exit costs, and make adjustments related to a financing lease obligation from our non-GAAP financial measures because these are considered by management to be outside of our core operating results. Accordingly, we believe that excluding these expenses provides investors and management with greater visibility to the underlying performance of our business operations and may also facilitate comparison with the results of other companies in our industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation and amortization, purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition and sponsor related costs and stock-based compensation expense.\nWe believe that adjusted EBITDA is a measure widely used by securities analysts and investors to evaluate the financial performance of our company and other companies. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is an important measure for evaluating our performance because it facilitates comparisons of our core operating results from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (net interest income or expense from our outstanding debt), asset base (depreciation and amortization), tax consequences, purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition and sponsor related costs and stock-based compensation. In addition, we base certain of our forward-looking estimates and budgets on adjusted EBITDA.\nThe following table reflects the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for the years

fair value write down of deferred revenue from the acquisition. For more information relating to such transaction, please see Note 3 of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nLicense Revenue. We generate license revenue through the sale of our on premises software license agreements. License transactions generally include an amount for first-year maintenance, which we recognize as subscription revenue. We typically recognize license revenue upon delivering the applicable license, assuming all revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. See the section titled -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Revenue Recognition\u201d for more information. Over time, we expect license revenue to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue as we continue to focus on increasing our subscription revenue as a key strategic priority.\nSubscription Revenue. Our subscription revenue consists of fees for (i) ongoing maintenance and support of our licensed solutions and (ii) subscription fees for access to, and related support for, our cloud-based solution. We typically invoice subscription fees in advance, in annual installments, and recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the applicable agreement, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. See the section titled -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Revenue Recognition\u201d for more information. Over time, we expect subscription revenue will increase as a percentage of total revenue as we continue to focus on increasing subscription revenue as a key strategic priority. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our subscription revenue was impacted by purchase accounting adjustments to deferred revenue from the Acquisition. See the section titled -Impact of Purchase Accounting.\u201d\nServices and Other Revenue. Services and other revenue consists primarily of fees from professional services provided to our customers and partners to configure and optimize the use of our solutions as well as training services related to the configuration and operation of our platform. Most of our professional services are priced on a time and materials basis, and we generally invoice customers monthly as the work is performed. We generally have standalone value for our professional services and recognize revenue as services are performed based on an estimated fair value as a separate unit of accounting. See the section titled -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Revenue Recognition\u201d for more information. Most of our professional services activity is in support of our partners, who perform the significant majority of all initial and follow-on configuration and optimization work\nfor our customers. Over time, we expect our professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue to decline as we increasingly rely on partners to help our customers deploy our software. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, our services and other revenue was impacted by purchase accounting adjustments to deferred revenue from the Acquisition. See the section titled -Impact of Purchase Accounting.\u201d\nImpact of Purchase Accounting. On September 8, 2014, SailPoint Technologies Holdings, Inc. acquired all of the capital stock of SailPoint Technologies, Inc. We refer to this transaction as the Acquisition. As a result of the Acquisition, we applied purchase accounting and a new basis of accounting beginning on the date of the Acquisition. As such, we were required by GAAP to record all assets and liabilities, including deferred revenue and long-lived assets, at fair value as of the effective date of the Acquisition, which in some cases was different than their historical book values. This had the effect of reducing revenue and deferred revenue and increasing cost of revenue from that which would have otherwise been recognized, as described in more detail below.\nWe assessed the fair value of deferred revenue acquired in the Acquisition to be $10.2 million, representing a decrease of $12.6 million from its historical book value. Recognizing deferred revenue at fair value reduces revenue in the periods subsequent to the Acquisition. The impact of the Acquisition to revenue was $0.1 million, $1.4 million and $5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effect of the Acquisition on the deferred costs was not material.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of License Revenue. Cost of license revenue consists of amortization expense for developed technology acquired in business combinations and third-party royalties.\nCost of Subscription Revenue. Cost of subscription revenue consists primarily of employee compensation cost (which consists of salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation), costs of our customer support organization, contractor costs to supplement our staff levels, allocated overhead, amortization expense for developed technology acquired in business combinations and third-party cloud-based hosting costs.\nCost of Services and Other Revenue. Cost of services and other revenue consists primarily of employee compensation costs of our professional services and training organizations, travel-related costs, contractor costs to supplement our staff levels and allocated overhead.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit is revenue less cost of revenue, and gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of revenue. Gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including the mix of our license, subscription, and services and other revenue, the costs associated with third-party cloud-based hosting services for our cloud-based subscriptions, and the extent to which we expand our customer support and services organizations. We expect that our overall gross margin will fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these various factors. Also, we expect our investment in technology to expand the capability of our services, enabling us to improve our gross margin over time.\nLicense Gross Margin. License gross margin is primarily affected by the cost of third-party royalties and amortization of developed technology acquired in business combinations, neither of which are expected to fluctuate materially from period to period in the near term.\nSubscription Gross Margin. Subscription gross margin is primarily affected by the growth in our subscription revenue as compared to the growth in, and timing of, cost of subscription revenue. Subscription gross margin is lower than our license gross margin due to, among other things, costs associated with our customer support organization and the costs associated with our cloud-based solution. We expect to continue to grow our subscription revenue, and the timing and rate of that growth might cause subscription gross margins to fluctuate in the near term then improve over time as we expect to see the benefits of scale in the infrastructure investments related to our cloud-based solution.\nServices and Other Gross Margin. Services and other gross margin is impacted by the number of customers using our professional services, the hourly rate we are able to charge for our services and the mix of services provided. Services and other gross margin is lower than our license gross margin and our subscription gross margin due to, among other things, costs associated with our professional services and training organizations.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs, allocated overhead and software and maintenance expenses, which includes cloud-based hosting costs related to the development of our cloud-based solution. We believe that continued investment in our offerings is vital to the growth of our business, and we intend to continue to invest in product development and in SailPoint Labs, our dedicated, stand-alone technology investigation and engineering group, to continue to innovate and offer our customers new solutions and to enhance our existing solutions as our business grows. See the section titled Business-Research and Development\u201d for more information. We expect such investment to increase on a dollar basis as our business grows.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs for corporate personnel, such as those in our executive, human resource, facilities, accounting and finance and information technology departments. In addition, general and administrative expenses include third-party professional fees and sponsor-related costs, as well as all other supporting corporate expenses not allocated to other departments. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase on a dollar basis as our business grows. Also, following the completion of our initial public offering in November 2017, we incur increased general and administrative expenses as a result of becoming a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, and increased expenses for insurance, investor relations and professional services.\nSales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs, sales commissions, costs of general marketing and promotional activities, travel-related expenses and allocated overhead. Sales commissions earned by our sales force on subscription contracts are deferred and amortized over the same period that revenue is recognized for the applicable contract. We expect to continue to invest in our sales force for expansion to new geographic and vertical markets. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase on a dollar basis and continue to be our largest operating expense category for the foreseeable future.\nAllocated Overhead. We allocate shared costs, such as facilities costs (including rent and utilities), information technology costs and recruiting costs, to all departments based on headcount. As such, allocated shared costs are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net consists primarily of interest expense and foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to the impact of transactions denominated in a foreign currency. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies has increased, and we expect this to continue. Interest expense, net of interest income, consists primarily of interest on our term loan facility, amortization of debt issuance costs, loss on the modification and partial extinguishment of debt and prepayment penalties.\nIncome Tax Expense\nProvision for income taxes consists of U.S. and state income taxes and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We have a full valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, and tax credits related primarily to research and development for our operations in the United States. We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance for the foreseeable future.\nOur income tax rate varies from the federal statutory rate due to the valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets and foreign withholding taxes; changing tax laws, regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate; changes to the financial accounting rules for income taxes; unanticipated changes in tax rates; differences in accounting and tax treatment of our stock-based compensation and the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions. We expect this fluctuation in income tax rates, as well as its potential impact on our results of operations, to continue.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of

License revenue increased by $24.8 million, or 46%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Although license revenue from new customers was greater than license revenue from existing customers for December 31, 2017 and 2016, the increase in total license revenue was primarily attributable to follow-on sales to our existing customers. During the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 revenue from new customers was $48.4 million and $42.2 million and license revenue from existing customers was $30.8 million and $12.2 million, respectively. Our revenue from any single customer is determined by the number of identities the customer is entitled to govern as well as the number of modules and solutions purchased.\nSubscription Revenue. Subscription revenue increased by $21.6 million, or 44%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in ongoing maintenance renewals and an increase in maintenance revenue derived from new licenses. Our customer base increased by 238, or 34%, from 695 customers at December 31, 2016 to 933 customers at December 31, 2017. Approximately $1.2 million of the increase in subscription revenue is the result of a decrease in the purchase accounting write down of deferred revenue subsequent to the Acquisition.\nServices and Other Revenue. Services and other revenue increased by $7.2 million, or 25%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily a result of an increase in the number of customers using our consulting and training services.\nGeographic Regions. Our operations in the United States were responsible for the largest portion of our revenue in each year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 because of our larger and more established sales force and partner network in the United States as compared to our other regions. Revenue from both Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA\u201d) and the rest of the world also increased for years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, primarily due to our investment in increasing the size of our international sales force and strengthening partnerships with global system integrators and resellers worldwide.\nThe following table sets forth, for each of the periods presented, our consolidated total revenue by geography and the respective percentage of total revenue:\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nrevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nrevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 134,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 92,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EMEA (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rest of the World (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 186,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 132,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) No single country represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenue. \nCost of Revenue\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> variance $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> variance %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Licenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscription\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of License Revenue.

Approximately $3.9 million of the increase in subscription revenue is the result of a decrease in the purchase accounting write down of deferred revenue subsequent to the Acquisition.\nServices and Other Revenue. Services and other revenue increased by $7.4 million, or 35%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily the result of an increase in the number of customers using our consulting and training services. Approximately $0.3 million of the increase in services and other revenue is the result of a decrease in the purchase accounting write down of deferred revenue subsequent to the Acquisition.\nGeographic Regions. Our operations in the United States were responsible for the largest portion of our revenue in each year ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, as well as for our revenue growth in year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year period, because of our larger and more established sales force and partner network in the United States as compared to our other regions. Revenue from both EMEA and the rest of the world also increased for the December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to our investment in increasing the size of our international sales force and strengthening partnerships with global system integrators and resellers worldwide.\nThe following table sets forth, for each of the periods presented, our consolidated total revenue by geography and the respective percentage of total revenue:\nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nrevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nrevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 92,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EMEA (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rest of the World (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 132,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 95,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) No single country represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenue. \nCost of Revenue\nTable 248: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> variance $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> variance %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Licenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (15\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscription\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of License Revenue.

calendar year presented; however, we experienced a decline sequentially from the fourth quarter of each year to the first quarter of the subsequent year due to increased customer purchasing activity in each fourth quarter. We continue to experience growth in license revenue when comparing similar periods year over year as a result of our ability to attract new customers and expand our product offerings within our existing customer base.\nOur quarterly subscription revenue increased in each period presented primarily due to increases in maintenance renewals as a result of our expanding licensed customer base. Sales of subscriptions to our platform also continue to grow as a result of the expanding breadth and functionality of our platform, increasing brand awareness, and the success of our sales efforts with new and existing customers. We recognize revenue from maintenance and subscription fees ratably over the term of the contract period; therefore, changes in our sales activity in a period may not be as apparent as a change to our revenue until future periods.\nOur quarterly services and other revenue increased sequentially in each period presented. We have experienced increasing demand for our consulting and training services as our customer base, including both licensed and recurring, has continued to expand.\nQuarterly Trends in Operating Expenses\nOur operating expenses have generally increased sequentially as a result of our growth and are primarily related to increases in personnel-related costs to support our expanded operations and our continued investment in our platform infrastructure and service capabilities.\nQuarterly Key Business Metrics\nTable 254: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9/30/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6/30/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12/31/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9/30/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6/30/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3/31/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $116.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.4 million of availability under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $3.2 million of cash and cash equivalents held in our foreign subsidiaries. We do not consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, with the exception of India, to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions and have consistently applied Section 956 of the Internal Revenue Code to such earnings. As a result of applying Section 956 consistently to our intercompany cash flows, the majority of the earnings in our foreign subsidiaries represent income that was previously taxed in the United States. As a result, there would be no material income tax consequences to repatriating the cash currently held in our foreign subsidiaries. In India, we continue to invest and grow our research and development activities and have no plans to repatriate undistributed earning held in India back to the U.S. parent company, and therefore consider earnings in India to be permanently reinvested.\nWe believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, any positive cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the continued expansion of sales and marketing activities and the introduction of new solutions and product enhancements. To the extent existing cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facility are not sufficient to fund future activities, we may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness may have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict operations. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Although we are not currently a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, services or technologies, we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future, which could also require us to seek additional equity financing, incur indebtedness, or use cash resources. We have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any such acquisitions. Also, as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures.\nSince inception, we have financed operations primarily through license fees, maintenance fees, subscription fees, consulting and training fees, borrowings under our credit facility and, to a lesser degree, the sale of equity securities. Our principal uses of cash are funding operations and capital expenditures. Over the past several years, revenue has increased significantly from year to year and, as a result, cash flows from customer collections have increased. However, operating expenses have also increased as we have invested in growing our business. Our operating cash requirements may increase in the future as we continue to invest in the strategic growth of our company.\nOur Credit Facility\nOn August 16, 2016, we entered into a senior secured credit facility (our credit facility\u201d), consisting of a $115 million term loan facility and a $5 million revolving credit facility, pursuant to a credit and guaranty agreement by and among SailPoint Technologies, Inc., as the borrower, and SailPoint Technologies Intermediate Holdings, LLC and SailPoint International, Inc., as guarantors, the lenders party thereto from time to time and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as administrative agent and collateral agent, which was subsequently amended and restated on November 2, 2016 to provide for a letter of credit sub-facility with an aggregate limit equal to the lesser of $5 million and the aggregate unused amount of the revolving commitments then in effect. Our credit facility was further amended on June 28, 2017 to provide for (i) an increase to the term loan facility in an additional principal amount of $50 million to partially fund a $50.4 million dividend paid to the holders of our preferred stock and (ii) an increase to the revolving credit facility in an additional principal amount of $2.5 million, and (iii) an increase in the letter of credit sub-facility aggregate limit to the lesser of $7.5 million and the aggregate unused amount of the revolving commitments then in effect. Each of the term loan facility and revolving credit facility has a maturity of five years and will mature on August 16, 2021.\nIn fourth quarter of 2017, we amended our existing credit facility in connection with the consummation of our initial public offering. Such amendment required that we use a portion of our net proceeds from our initial public offering to repay an amount of borrowings outstanding under our term loan facility to reduce the aggregate outstanding principal amount thereof to $70.0 million (which repayment was subject to a prepayment premium of 1.50%). We used a portion of our net proceeds from our initial public offering to repay $90.0 million of such borrowings and paid the related prepayment premium of approximately $1.4 million. In addition, this payment resulted in a non-cash charge of $1.7 million on the modification and partial extinguishment of debt.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the balance outstanding under the term loan facility was $70.0 million and is included in long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. Our revolving line of credit has a face value of $7.5 million and was undrawn as of December 31, 2017. We had $1.4 million available under the revolving credit facility due to $6.1 million in standby letters of credit, issued primarily in connection with our new corporate headquarters lease. See Item 2 Properties\u201d for more information regarding our new corporate headquarters lease.\nAll of our obligations under our credit facility are guaranteed by our existing and future domestic subsidiaries and, subject to certain exceptions, secured by a security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 255: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,521\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,255\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,308\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,962\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 97,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,899\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nDuring 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $21.9 million, which consisted of a net loss of $7.6 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $17.2 million and a net change of $12.2 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges are primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $10.2 million, amortization of debt issuance costs of $0.7 million, loss on modification and partial extinguishment of debt of $1.7 million and stock-based compensation of $4.5 million. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily as a result of an increase in deferred revenue of $28.0 million due to the timing of billings and cash received in advance of revenue recognition primarily for subscription and support services, an increase in accrued expenses of $10.9 million due primarily to accrual of additional commissions and bonuses, an increase in accounts payable of $1.4 million due to timing of cash disbursements, an increase in income taxes payable of $0.6 million, partially offset by an increase in prepayments and other assets of $2.2 million, and increase in other non-current assets of $2.5 million, and an increase in accounts receivable of $24.1 million due to the timing of receipts of payments from customers.\nDuring 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $6.5 million, which consisted of a net loss of $3.2 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $8.8 million and a net change of $0.9 million in our net operating assets and liabilities.

The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily as a result of an increase in deferred revenue of $20.2 million due to the timing of billings and cash received in advance of revenue recognition primarily for subscription and support services and an increase in accrued expenses of $1.7 million related primarily to commissions on our subscription revenue, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $17.2 million due to the timing of receipts of payments from customers, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $3.6 million due to payments for various services to be rendered in subsequent periods and a decrease in accounts payable of $0.3 million due to timing of cash disbursements.\nDuring 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 million, which consisted of a net loss of $10.8 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $6.7 million and a change of $7.7 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges are primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $9.6 million, amortization of debt issuance costs of $0.1 million, and stock-based compensation of $0.2 million, partially offset by $3.3 million in deferred taxes. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, was primarily a result of an increase in deferred revenue of $11.6 million due to the timing of billings and cash received in advance of revenue recognition primarily for subscription and support services and an increase in accrued expenses of $3.1 million related primarily to commissions on our subscription revenue, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $5.3 million due to the timing of receipts of payments from customers, an increase in prepayments and other assets of $1.1 million due to payments for various services to be rendered in subsequent periods, and an increase in accounts payable of $0.6 million due to timing of cash disbursements.\nCash Flows from Investing

by $90.0 million in repayments of debt, $1.4 million of debt issuance cost, $50.4 million for preferred dividend payments, $1.4 million in debt prepayment and $0.7 million in purchase of equity shares.\nDuring 2016, cash used in financing activities was $2.0 million, consisting of $3.1 million in debt issuance costs and $0.2 million for the repurchase of common and preferred stock, partially

from a draw down on our prior credit facility and $0.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock, partially offset by $0.5 million for the repurchase of common and preferred stock.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements and do not have any holdings in variable interest entities, which includes special purposes entities and other structured finance entities.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our non-cancellable contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 256: <table> <tr>

In 2017, we used a portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to repay $90.0 million of such borrowings and paid the related prepayment premium of approximately $1.4 million. \n (2) Amounts represent estimated future interest payments on borrowings under our term loan facility, which are floating rate instruments and were estimated using the interest rate effective at December 31, 2017 of approximately 5.5% multiplied by the principal outstanding on December 31, 2017. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, and expenses and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be effected.\nWe believe that the accounting policies associated with revenue recognition, share-based compensation and income taxes are most significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates. Therefore, these are considered to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue from the following sources: (i) fees for licenses, (ii) ongoing maintenance of our licensed products and subscription fees for access to our cloud-based offering and related support and (iii) fees for consulting with our customers on configuring and optimizing the use of our products and subscription services and training services related to the implementation and configuration of our platform.\nWe recognize revenue net of sales taxes and other applicable taxes, in accordance with GAAP, when all of the following criteria are met: there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or service has been performed, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable.\nWhen non-software arrangements involve multiple elements that qualify as separate units of accounting, we allocate revenue to each deliverable based upon its relative selling price. The estimated selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) of selling price, if available; (ii) third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d) of selling price, if VSOE of selling price is not available; or (iii) best estimate of selling price ( ESP\u201d), if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE of selling price is available. When software arrangements involve multiple elements that qualify as separate units of accounting, we allocate revenue to each element based on VSOE.\nWe frequently enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple elements or deliverables. For arrangements that include both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and separable non-software deliverables as a group based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price used for allocating revenue to the deliverables as follows: (i) VSOE, (ii) TPE and (iii) ESP. Cloud-based services, and professional services related to cloud-based services, are considered to be non-software elements in our arrangements.\nVSOE of fair value for each element is based on our standard rates charged for the product or service when such product or service is sold separately or based upon the price established by our pricing committee when that product or service is not yet being sold separately. We establish VSOE for maintenance and professional services using a bell-shaped curve\u201d approach. When applying the bell-shaped curve\u201d approach, we analyze all maintenance renewal transactions over the past 12 months for that category of license and plot those data points on a bell-shaped curve to ensure that a high percentage of the data points are within an acceptable margin of the established VSOE rate. This analysis is performed quarterly on a rolling 12-month basis.\nWhen we are unable to establish a selling price for non-software arrangements using VSOE or TPE, we use ESP in the allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy, pricing factors and analysis of historical transactions.\nRevenue for software arrangements that include undelivered elements is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements for which we have established VSOE is deferred and recognized as delivered to the customer and the remaining portion of the agreement fee is recognized as license revenue upon delivery. The determination of fair value of each undelivered element in software arrangements is based on VSOE. If VSOE has not been established for certain undelivered elements in an agreement, revenue is deferred until those elements have been delivered or their VSOE has been determined.\nRevenue from maintenance and SaaS services is recognized ratably over the relevant contract period.\nServices revenue includes fees from consulting and training services. Consulting and training services are judged to not be essential to the functionality of our software and SaaS offerings, are listed separately in arrangements, are optional, and are sold separately. As a result, the Company has established VSOE or ESP for consulting and training services and they therefore qualify for separate accounting.\nIn order to account for deliverables in some multiple-deliverable arrangements as separate units of accounting, delivered elements must have standalone value. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the software or SaaS sale, and the contractual dependence of the sale on the customer's satisfaction with the professional services. Professional services sold as part of SaaS arrangements generally qualify for separate accounting.\nConsulting and training service revenue that qualifies for separate accounting is recognized as the services are performed using the proportional performance method for fixed fee consulting contracts, or when the right to the service expires. Many of our consulting contracts are billed on a time and materials basis.\nCustomer advances and billed amounts due from customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation costs related to equity awards, including stock options and incentive units, granted based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of stock-based awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period).\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. Our assumptions are as follows:\n \u2022 Expected volatility. As we have been a public company for a limited amount of time and do not have a sufficient trading history for our common stock, the expected stock price volatility for our common stock is estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for industry peers over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available. \n \u2022 Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group. \n \u2022 Expected dividend yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends to common stockholders and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero. \n \u2022 Expected term. The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. As we do not have sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term of the stock option awards granted, we base our expected term for awards issued to employees or members of our board of directors on the simplified method, which represents the average period from vesting to the expiration of the stock option. \nIn addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation for our equity awards. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected terms and forfeiture rates used for our stock-based compensation calculations on a prospective basis.\nWe analyze the facts and circumstances of each equity instrument to determine if modification accounting is required. This analysis includes a review of factors that influence the probability of vesting. If circumstances arise that have changed the probability that an equity instrument will vest, or other factors have triggered a modification, the revised fair value is calculated, and additional stock-based compensation is recognized over the remaining service period of the modified option.\nHistorically, for all periods prior to our initial public offering, the fair values of the shares of common stock underlying our stock-based awards were estimated on each grant date by our board of directors. In order to determine the fair value of our common stock underlying option grants, our board of directors considered, among other things, enterprise value of comparable public companies evaluated on a quarterly basis and the overall market and economic environment.\nFor stock awards after the completion of our initial public offering, our board of directors determines the fair value of each share of underlying common stock based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date of grant.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to federal, state and local taxes in the United States as well as in other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to current federal and state income tax in the United States.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions based on those positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We determine if the amount of available support indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. We then measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which such determination is made.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had deferred tax assets of approximately $5.6 million, primarily comprised of our net operating loss carryforwards. We have a full valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, and tax credits related primarily to research and development for our operations in the United States. We will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist. Any adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the periods in which the adjustment is determined to be required.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and identified net assets acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives are not be amortized, but rather tested for impairment annually, or more often if and when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We have determined that we operate as one reporting unit and may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not\u201d that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and whether the two-step impairment test on goodwill is required. Goodwill is tested using a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired, and thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test, used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. After a goodwill impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill shall be its new accounting basis. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference. There were no impairments of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, and our reporting unit is not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test.\nIn 2017, we elected to change the annual assessment date for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets from December 31st to October 31st because the change in date creates synergy and enhance the quality of our indefinite lived intangible assets impairment analysis.\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act ( JOBS\u201d) Act Accounting Election\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of all of the reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards, until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Our election to use the phase-in periods permitted by this election may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the longer phase-in periods under the JOBS Act and who will comply with new or revised financial accounting standards. If we were to subsequently elect to instead comply with these public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable pursuant to the JOBS Act.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of our recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted, see Note 2 of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future, and our interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results we expect for the full fiscal year or any other period.\nOverview\nSailPoint is the leading provider of enterprise identity governance solutions. Our open identity platform provides organizations with critical visibility into who currently has access to which resources, who should have access to those resources, and how that access is being used.\nWe offer both on-premises software and cloud-based solutions, which empower our customers to efficiently and securely govern the digital identities of employees, contractors, business partners and other users, and manage their constantly changing access rights to enterprise applications and data across hybrid IT environments, whether comprised of on-premises, cloud or mobile applications. We help customers enable their businesses with more agile and innovative IT, enhance their security posture and better meet compliance and regulatory requirements. We believe that our open identity platform is a critical, foundational layer of a modern cyber security strategy that complements and builds upon traditional perimeter- and endpoint-centric security solutions, which on their own are increasingly insufficient to secure organizations, and their applications and data. Our customers include many of the world's largest and most complex organizations, including commercial enterprises, educational institutions and governments.\nWe were founded by identity industry veterans to develop a new category of identity management solutions and address emerging identity governance challenges. Since our inception, we have focused on driving innovation in the identity market, with our key milestones including:\n \u2022 in 2007, we pioneered identity governance through our release of IdentityIQ, our on-premises identity governance solution; \n \u2022 in 2010, we revolutionized provisioning by integrating it with IdentityIQ into a single solution; \n \u2022 in 2013, we introduced our cloud-based identity governance solution, IdentityNow; \n \u2022 in 2015, we extended identity governance by adding our identity governance for data stored in files solution, SecurityIQ, which manages user access to unstructured data, a rapidly growing area of risk; and \n \u2022 in 2017, we further extended identity governance with the introduction of our advanced identity analytics solution, IdentityAI, which is designed to use machine learning technologies to enable rapid detection of security threats before they turn into security breaches. \nOur solutions address the complex needs of global enterprises and mid-market organizations. As of December 31, 2017, 933 customers across a wide variety of industries were using our products to enable and secure digital identities across the globe. No single customer represented more than 10% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nOur revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 36% from the year ended December 31, 2012 to the year ended December 31, 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our revenue was $186.1 million, $132.4 million, and $95.4 million, respectively. During such periods, purchase accounting adjustments related to the Acquisition reduced our revenue by $0.1 million, $1.4 million and $5.6 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our net loss was $7.6 million, $3.2 million, and $10.8 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our net cash provided by operations was $21.9 million, $6.5 million, and $3.6 million, respectively.\nOur success is principally dependent on our ability to deliver compelling solutions to attract new customers and retain existing customers. Delivering these solutions is challenging because our customers have large, complex IT environments, often rely on both legacy and innovative technologies, and deploy different business models, including on premise and cloud solutions. Rising security threats and evolving regulations and compliance standards for cyber security, data protection, privacy and internal IT controls create new opportunities for our industry and require us to adapt our solutions to be successful. Our ability to continue to maintain our historical growth rates is also challenging because our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our global presence and invest in new vertical markets, while competing against much larger companies with more recognizable brands and financial resources. Although we seek to grow rapidly, we also focus on delivering positive net cash from operations while continuing to invest in our platform and to deliver innovative solutions to our customers. Additionally, our gross margins vary depending on the type of solution we sell, and a shift in the mix of our solutions could affect our performance relative to historical results.\nOur Business Model\nWe deliver an integrated set of solutions that supports all aspects of identity governance, including provisioning, access request, compliance controls, password management and identity governance for data stored in files. Our solutions are built on an open identity platform, which offers connectivity to a variety of security and operational IT applications, extending the reach of our identity governance processes and enabling effective identity governance controls across customer environments.\nOur set of solutions currently consists of (i) IdentityIQ, our on-premises identity governance solution, (ii) IdentityNow, our cloud-based, multi-tenant governance suite, which is delivered as a subscription service, and (iii) SecurityIQ, our on-premises identity governance for files solution that secures access to data stored in file servers, collaboration portals, mailboxes and cloud storage systems, and (iv) IdentityAI, our cloud-based advanced identity analytics solution. See in Part I - Item 1, the section titled Business-Products\u201d for more information regarding our solutions.\nFor our IdentityIQ and SecurityIQ solutions, our customers typically purchase a perpetual software license, which includes one year of maintenance. Our maintenance provides software maintenance as well as access to our technical support services during the maintenance term. After the initial maintenance period, customers with perpetual licenses may renew their maintenance agreement for an additional fee. For our cloud-based solutions, IdentityNow and IdentityAI, for a subscription fee, we offer customers access to this solution and infrastructure support for the duration of their subscription agreement. Our standard subscription agreement for our IdentityNow solution has a duration of three years.\nPricing for each of our solutions is dependent on the number of digital identities of employees, contractors, business partners and other users that the customer is entitled to govern with the solution. We also package and price our IdentityIQ and IdentityNow solutions into modules. Each module has unique functionalities, and our IdentityIQ and IdentityNow customers are able to purchase one or more modules, depending on their needs. We package and price SecurityIQ, our identity governance for files solution, by target storage systems. Thus, our revenue from any customer is generally determined by the number of identities that the customer is entitled to govern as well as the number of modules (for our IdentityIQ and IdentityNow solutions) or target storage systems (for our SecurityIQ solution) purchased by the customer.\nOur go-to-market strategy consists of both direct sales and indirect sales through our partnership network of systems integrators, value-added resellers and adjacent technology vendors. We work closely with systems integrators, many of whom have dedicated SailPoint practices (including Accenture, Deloitte, KPMG and PwC), with some dating back more than seven years, and resellers (including value-added resellers such as Optiv) to identify potential sales opportunities and help us increase our reach, and we frequently cooperate with systems integrators to make joint sales proposals to address our mutual customers' requirements. We also collaborate with leading access management vendors by adding our identity governance capabilities to their access management services (e.g., Microsoft, Okta and VMware). We do not have any material payment obligations to systems integrators, resellers or our technology partners; nor do they have any material payment obligations to us, except that resellers typically purchase solutions directly from us and resell to customers. See the section titled Business-Partnerships and Strategic Relationships\u201d for more information regarding our partnership network.\nIn addition to our solutions, we offer professional services to our customers and partners to configure and optimize the use of our solutions as well as training services related to the configuration and operation of our platform. Most of our professional services activity is in support of our partners, who perform a significant majority of all initial and follow-on implementation work for our customers. Most of our consulting services are priced on a time and materials basis; our training services are provided through multiple pricing models, including on a per-person basis (for courses provided at our headquarters and on-site at our customers' offices) and a flat-rate basis (for our e-learning course).\nWe devote significant resources to acquire new customers, in both existing and new markets, in order to grow our customer base. In addition, we focus on three distinct opportunities to increase sales to existing customers: (i) expand the number of digital identities; (ii) up-sell additional modules or target storage systems, as applicable, within a single solution; and (iii) cross-sell additional solutions.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nOur historical financial performance has been, and we expect our financial performance in the future to be, driven by our ability to:\n \u2022 Add New Customers Within Existing Markets. Based on data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, we believe that we have penetrated less than 2% of the approximately 65,000 companies in the countries where we have customers today and that as a result, there is significant opportunity to expand our footprint in our existing markets through new, greenfield installations and displacement of our competitors' legacy solutions. To do so, we plan to grow our sales organization, increase and leverage our indirect channel partners and enhance our marketing efforts. \n \u2022 Generate Additional Sales to Existing Customers. We believe that our existing customer base provides us with a significant opportunity to drive incremental sales. In most cases, our customers initially purchase a subset of the modules or solutions we offer based on their immediate need. We focus on generating more revenue from the modules that our customers have already purchased from us as our customers grow the number of identities our solutions manage and govern and as our customers deploy our solutions across other business units or geographies within their organizations. Over time, we also identify up-selling and cross-selling opportunities and seek to sell additional modules and solutions to our existing customers. \n \u2022 Retain Customers. We believe that our ability to retain our customers is an important component of our growth strategy and reflects the long-term value of our customer relationships. For example, when we add a new customer, we generate new license revenue. If the customer renews, we generate incremental maintenance revenue. As we add new IdentityIQ customers, our high renewal rates result in incremental maintenance revenue. Our key strategies to maintain our high renewal rates include focusing on the quality and reliability of our solutions, customer service and support to ensure our customers receive value from our solutions, providing consistent software upgrades and having dedicated customer success teams. \n \u2022 Expand into New Markets. We expect to continue to invest significantly in sales, marketing and customer service, as well as our indirect channel partner network, to expand into new geographies and vertical markets. We believe that our market opportunity is large and growing and that the global cyber security market represents a significant growth opportunity for us. In 2017, we generated only 28% of our revenue outside of the United States. \nKey Business Metrics\nIn addition to our GAAP financial information, we monitor the following key metrics to help us measure and evaluate the effectiveness of our operations:\n\n \u2022 Number of Customers. We believe that the size of our customer base is an indicator of our market penetration and that our net customer additions are an indicator of the growth of our business and our future revenue opportunity. We define a customer as a distinct entity, division or business unit of an organization that receives support or has the right to use our cloud-based solutions as of the specified measurement date. \n \u2022 Subscription Revenue as a Percentage of Total Revenue. Subscription revenue is a portion of our total revenue and is derived from (i) IdentityNow, our cloud-based solution where customers enter into SaaS subscription agreements with us, and (ii) IdentityIQ and SecurityIQ maintenance and support agreements, but not licenses. As we generally sell our solutions on a per-identity basis, our subscription revenue for any customer is primarily determined by the number of identities that the customer is entitled to govern as part of a SaaS subscription, and the ongoing price paid per-identity under a maintenance and support agreement or SaaS subscription. Thus, we consider our subscription revenue to be the recurring portion of our revenue base and believe that its continued growth as a percentage of total revenue will lead to a more predictable revenue model and increase our visibility to future period total revenues. Because we recognize our subscription revenue ratably over the duration of those agreements, a portion of the revenue we recognize each period is derived from agreements we entered into in prior periods. In contrast, we typically recognize license revenue upon entering into the applicable license, the timing of which is less predictable and may cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is a measure widely used by securities analysts and investors to evaluate the financial performance of our company and other companies. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is an important measure for evaluating our performance because it facilitates comparisons of our core operating results from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (net interest income or expense from our outstanding debt), asset base (depreciation and amortization), tax consequences, purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition and sponsor related costs and stock-based compensation. In addition, we base certain of our forward-looking estimates and budgets on adjusted EBITDA. See the section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for more information regarding adjusted EBITDA, including the limitations of using adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure, and for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures to clarify and enhance our understanding of past performance and future prospects. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance, financial position or cash flow that includes or excludes amounts that are included or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. As discussed below, we monitor the non-GAAP financial measures described below, and we believe they are helpful to investors.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry because they may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. In particular, interest expense, which is excluded from adjusted EBITDA has been and will continue to be a significant recurring expense in our business for the foreseeable future. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We urge you to review the reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nWe exclude stock-based compensation expense because it is non-cash in nature and excluding this expense provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and allows investors the ability to make more meaningful comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies. We also exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, the partial release of the valuation allowance due to acquisition, facility exit costs, and make adjustments related to a financing lease obligation from our non-GAAP financial measures because these are considered by management to be outside of our core operating results. Accordingly, we believe that excluding these expenses provides investors and management with greater visibility to the underlying performance of our business operations and may also facilitate comparison with the results of other companies in our industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation and amortization, purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition and sponsor related costs and stock-based compensation expense.\nWe believe that adjusted EBITDA is a measure widely used by securities analysts and investors to evaluate the financial performance of our company and other companies. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is an important measure for evaluating our performance because it facilitates comparisons of our core operating results from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (net interest income or expense from our outstanding debt), asset base (depreciation and amortization), tax consequences, purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition and sponsor related costs and stock-based compensation. In addition, we base certain of our forward-looking estimates and budgets on adjusted EBITDA.\nThe following table reflects the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\nThe following table reflects the reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for each of the quarters indicated:\n\n (1) Purchase accounting adjustment related to the fair value write down of deferred revenue from the acquisition. For more information relating to such transaction, please see Note 3 of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nLicense Revenue. We generate license revenue through the sale of our on premises software license agreements. License transactions generally include an amount for first-year maintenance, which we recognize as subscription revenue. We typically recognize license revenue upon delivering the applicable license, assuming all revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. See the section titled -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Revenue Recognition\u201d for more information. Over time, we expect license revenue to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue as we continue to focus on increasing our subscription revenue as a key strategic priority.\nSubscription Revenue. Our subscription revenue consists of fees for (i) ongoing maintenance and support of our licensed solutions and (ii) subscription fees for access to, and related support for, our cloud-based solution. We typically invoice subscription fees in advance, in annual installments, and recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the applicable agreement, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. See the section titled -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Revenue Recognition\u201d for more information. Over time, we expect subscription revenue will increase as a percentage of total revenue as we continue to focus on increasing subscription revenue as a key strategic priority. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our subscription revenue was impacted by purchase accounting adjustments to deferred revenue from the Acquisition. See the section titled -Impact of Purchase Accounting.\u201d\nServices and Other Revenue. Services and other revenue consists primarily of fees from professional services provided to our customers and partners to configure and optimize the use of our solutions as well as training services related to the configuration and operation of our platform. Most of our professional services are priced on a time and materials basis, and we generally invoice customers monthly as the work is performed. We generally have standalone value for our professional services and recognize revenue as services are performed based on an estimated fair value as a separate unit of accounting. See the section titled -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Revenue Recognition\u201d for more information. Most of our professional services activity is in support of our partners, who perform the significant majority of all initial and follow-on configuration and optimization work\nfor our customers. Over time, we expect our professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue to decline as we increasingly rely on partners to help our customers deploy our software. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, our services and other revenue was impacted by purchase accounting adjustments to deferred revenue from the Acquisition. See the section titled -Impact of Purchase Accounting.\u201d\nImpact of Purchase Accounting. On September 8, 2014, SailPoint Technologies Holdings, Inc. acquired all of the capital stock of SailPoint Technologies, Inc. We refer to this transaction as the Acquisition. As a result of the Acquisition, we applied purchase accounting and a new basis of accounting beginning on the date of the Acquisition. As such, we were required by GAAP to record all assets and liabilities, including deferred revenue and long-lived assets, at fair value as of the effective date of the Acquisition, which in some cases was different than their historical book values. This had the effect of reducing revenue and deferred revenue and increasing cost of revenue from that which would have otherwise been recognized, as described in more detail below.\nWe assessed the fair value of deferred revenue acquired in the Acquisition to be $10.2 million, representing a decrease of $12.6 million from its historical book value. Recognizing deferred revenue at fair value reduces revenue in the periods subsequent to the Acquisition. The impact of the Acquisition to revenue was $0.1 million, $1.4 million and $5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effect of the Acquisition on the deferred costs was not material.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of License Revenue. Cost of license revenue consists of amortization expense for developed technology acquired in business combinations and third-party royalties.\nCost of Subscription Revenue. Cost of subscription revenue consists primarily of employee compensation cost (which consists of salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation), costs of our customer support organization, contractor costs to supplement our staff levels, allocated overhead, amortization expense for developed technology acquired in business combinations and third-party cloud-based hosting costs.\nCost of Services and Other Revenue. Cost of services and other revenue consists primarily of employee compensation costs of our professional services and training organizations, travel-related costs, contractor costs to supplement our staff levels and allocated overhead.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit is revenue less cost of revenue, and gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of revenue. Gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including the mix of our license, subscription, and services and other revenue, the costs associated with third-party cloud-based hosting services for our cloud-based subscriptions, and the extent to which we expand our customer support and services organizations. We expect that our overall gross margin will fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these various factors. Also, we expect our investment in technology to expand the capability of our services, enabling us to improve our gross margin over time.\nLicense Gross Margin. License gross margin is primarily affected by the cost of third-party royalties and amortization of developed technology acquired in business combinations, neither of which are expected to fluctuate materially from period to period in the near term.\nSubscription Gross Margin. Subscription gross margin is primarily affected by the growth in our subscription revenue as compared to the growth in, and timing of, cost of subscription revenue. Subscription gross margin is lower than our license gross margin due to, among other things, costs associated with our customer support organization and the costs associated with our cloud-based solution. We expect to continue to grow our subscription revenue, and the timing and rate of that growth might cause subscription gross margins to fluctuate in the near term then improve over time as we expect to see the benefits of scale in the infrastructure investments related to our cloud-based solution.\nServices and Other Gross Margin. Services and other gross margin is impacted by the number of customers using our professional services, the hourly rate we are able to charge for our services and the mix of services provided. Services and other gross margin is lower than our license gross margin and our subscription gross margin due to, among other things, costs associated with our professional services and training organizations.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs, allocated overhead and software and maintenance expenses, which includes cloud-based hosting costs related to the development of our cloud-based solution. We believe that continued investment in our offerings is vital to the growth of our business, and we intend to continue to invest in product development and in SailPoint Labs, our dedicated, stand-alone technology investigation and engineering group, to continue to innovate and offer our customers new solutions and to enhance our existing solutions as our business grows. See the section titled Business-Research and Development\u201d for more information. We expect such investment to increase on a dollar basis as our business grows.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs for corporate personnel, such as those in our executive, human resource, facilities, accounting and finance and information technology departments. In addition, general and administrative expenses include third-party professional fees and sponsor-related costs, as well as all other supporting corporate expenses not allocated to other departments. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase on a dollar basis as our business grows. Also, following the completion of our initial public offering in November 2017, we incur increased general and administrative expenses as a result of becoming a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, and increased expenses for insurance, investor relations and professional services.\nSales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs, sales commissions, costs of general marketing and promotional activities, travel-related expenses and allocated overhead. Sales commissions earned by our sales force on subscription contracts are deferred and amortized over the same period that revenue is recognized for the applicable contract. We expect to continue to invest in our sales force for expansion to new geographic and vertical markets. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase on a dollar basis and continue to be our largest operating expense category for the foreseeable future.\nAllocated Overhead. We allocate shared costs, such as facilities costs (including rent and utilities), information technology costs and recruiting costs, to all departments based on headcount. As such, allocated shared costs are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net consists primarily of interest expense and foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to the impact of transactions denominated in a foreign currency. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies has increased, and we expect this to continue. Interest expense, net of interest income, consists primarily of interest on our term loan facility, amortization of debt issuance costs, loss on the modification and partial extinguishment of debt and prepayment penalties.\nIncome Tax Expense\nProvision for income taxes consists of U.S. and state income taxes and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We have a full valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, and tax credits related primarily to research and development for our operations in the United States. We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance for the foreseeable future.\nOur income tax rate varies from the federal statutory rate due to the valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets and foreign withholding taxes; changing tax laws, regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate; changes to the financial accounting rules for income taxes; unanticipated changes in tax rates; differences in accounting and tax treatment of our stock-based compensation and the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions. We expect this fluctuation in income tax rates, as well as its potential impact on our results of operations, to continue.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods indicated:\n\n (1) Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows: \n\nThe following table sets forth the consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods presented as a percentage of total revenue:\n\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue\n\nLicense Revenue. License revenue increased by $24.8 million, or 46%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Although license revenue from new customers was greater than license revenue from existing customers for December 31, 2017 and 2016, the increase in total license revenue was primarily attributable to follow-on sales to our existing customers. During the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 revenue from new customers was $48.4 million and $42.2 million and license revenue from existing customers was $30.8 million and $12.2 million, respectively. Our revenue from any single customer is determined by the number of identities the customer is entitled to govern as well as the number of modules and solutions purchased.\nSubscription Revenue. Subscription revenue increased by $21.6 million, or 44%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in ongoing maintenance renewals and an increase in maintenance revenue derived from new licenses. Our customer base increased by 238, or 34%, from 695 customers at December 31, 2016 to 933 customers at December 31, 2017. Approximately $1.2 million of the increase in subscription revenue is the result of a decrease in the purchase accounting write down of deferred revenue subsequent to the Acquisition.\nServices and Other Revenue. Services and other revenue increased by $7.2 million, or 25%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily a result of an increase in the number of customers using our consulting and training services.\nGeographic Regions. Our operations in the United States were responsible for the largest portion of our revenue in each year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 because of our larger and more established sales force and partner network in the United States as compared to our other regions. Revenue from both Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA\u201d) and the rest of the world also increased for years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, primarily due to our investment in increasing the size of our international sales force and strengthening partnerships with global system integrators and resellers worldwide.\nThe following table sets forth, for each of the periods presented, our consolidated total revenue by geography and the respective percentage of total revenue:\n\n (1) No single country represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenue. \nCost of Revenue\n\nCost of License Revenue. The cost of license revenue increased by $0.3 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. During each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, cost of license revenue included $4.0 million in amortization of intangibles acquired in business combinations.\nCost of Subscription Revenue. Cost of subscription revenue increased by $3.4 million, or 26%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Approximately $1.7 million was attributable to an increase in headcount and related allocated expenses to support growth of our subscription cloud-based offering and ongoing maintenance for our expanding licensed customer base. Approximately $1.6 million was attributable to our increased cloud-based hosting costs.\nCost of Services and Other Revenue. Cost of services and other revenue increased by $3.9 million, or 20%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Substantially all of the increase was the result of our increased services and training headcount and related allocated overhead.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\n\nLicenses. License gross profit increased by $24.5 million, or 49%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was the result of increased license revenues with only minor increases in third party royalties.\nSubscription. Subscription gross profit increased by $18.3 million, or 50%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was the result of growth in subscription revenue, as described above, coupled with growth in costs of subscription revenue at a rate lower than our revenue growth as we continue to build economies of scale within our customer support organization and our utilization of cloud-based hosting services.\nServices and Other. Services and other gross profit increased by $3.3 million, or 37%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was the result of the volume and mix of services provided in the period yielding a higher price per hour as well as the headcount required to provide such professional services increasing at a slower rate as we continue to build economies of scale within our professional services and training organization.\nOperating Expenses\n\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased by $9.0 million, or 37%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Approximately 81% of this increase was the result of an increase in headcount, and related allocated overhead, to optimize and expand our product offerings as well as pursue innovation in identity governance. Substantially all of the remaining increase in research and development expenses was the result of increased software and maintenance expenses, primarily cloud-based hosting costs related to the development of our cloud-based offering.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $8.0 million, or 83%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Approximately 77% of the increase was the result of an increase in corporate headcount, and related allocated overhead, to support the growth and scale of the business. In 2017, approximately $2.0 million of increase was related to stock compensation expense compared to 2016. Additionally, general and administrative expenses increased as a result of increase in professional services expenses comprised of legal, accounting and consulting fees.\nSales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased by $21.9 million, or 37%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Approximately $17.4 million, or 80%, of the increase was the result of our increased sales and marketing headcount, and related allocated overhead, to support increased penetration into our existing customer base as well as expansion into new industry verticals and geographic markets. As our headcount increased we also experienced related increases in travel and advertising costs of $1.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Substantially all of the remaining increase in sales and marketing expenses was the result of increased partner commissions and consulting costs.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, increased by $7.3 million, or 93%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. These increases were the result of our entry into a new credit facility, effective in August 2016, which increased the stated interest rate from 3.7% to 9.0%, as well as our amendment in June of 2017, which increased the term loan principal by $50 million. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we paid down $90.0 million of our debt resulting in approximately $1.4 million of cash prepayment penalties and $1.7 million in a non-cash loss on the resulting modification and partial extinguishment of our debt.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nRevenue\n\nLicense Revenue. License revenue increased by $10.3 million, or 23%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to sales to new customers. During the years ended December 2015 and 2016, license revenue from new customers was $29.4 million and $42.2 million, respectively and license revenue from existing customers was $14.7 million and $12.2 million, respectively. Our revenue from any single customer is determined by the number of identities the customer is entitled to govern as well as the number of modules and solutions purchased.\nSubscription Revenue. Subscription revenue increased by $19.4 million, or 65%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in maintenance renewals and an increase in maintenance revenue derived from new licenses sales. Our customer base increased by 175, or 34%, from 520 customers at December 31, 2015 to 695 customers at December 31, 2016. Approximately $3.9 million of the increase in subscription revenue is the result of a decrease in the purchase accounting write down of deferred revenue subsequent to the Acquisition.\nServices and Other Revenue. Services and other revenue increased by $7.4 million, or 35%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily the result of an increase in the number of customers using our consulting and training services. Approximately $0.3 million of the increase in services and other revenue is the result of a decrease in the purchase accounting write down of deferred revenue subsequent to the Acquisition.\nGeographic Regions. Our operations in the United States were responsible for the largest portion of our revenue in each year ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, as well as for our revenue growth in year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year period, because of our larger and more established sales force and partner network in the United States as compared to our other regions. Revenue from both EMEA and the rest of the world also increased for the December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to our investment in increasing the size of our international sales force and strengthening partnerships with global system integrators and resellers worldwide.\nThe following table sets forth, for each of the periods presented, our consolidated total revenue by geography and the respective percentage of total revenue:\n\n (1) No single country represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenue. \nCost of Revenue\n\nCost of License Revenue. The cost of license revenue did not materially change in dollar amount from period to period. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, cost of license revenues included $4.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively, of amortization of intangibles acquired in business combinations.\nCost of Subscription Revenue. Cost of subscription revenue increased by $3.2 million, or 33%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Approximately $2.6 million of the increase was the result of our increased headcount, and related allocated overhead, to support growth of our subscription cloud-based offering and ongoing maintenance for our expanding licensed customer base. Approximately $0.6 million of the increase was the result of our increased cloud-based hosting costs for our cloud-based solution. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, cost of subscription revenue included $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of amortization of intangibles acquired in business combinations.\nCost of Services and Other Revenue. Cost of services and other revenue increased by $4.6 million, or 30%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Approximately 95% of the increase was the result of our increased services and training headcount and related allocated overhead.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\n\nLicenses. License gross profit increased by $10.3 million, or 26%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was the result of increased license revenue as well as decreased costs on license revenue as a result of acquiring the SecurityIQ technology in July of 2015.\nSubscription. Subscription gross profit increased by $16.2 million, or 81%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was the result of growth in subscription revenue, as described above, coupled with growth in costs of subscription revenue at a rate lower than our revenue growth as we continue to build economies of scale within our customer support organization and our utilization of cloud-based hosting services.\nServices and Other. Services and other gross profit increased by $2.8 million, or 45%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was the result of the volume and mix of services provided in the period.\nOperating Expenses\n\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased by $4.4 million, or 22%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Approximately $4.0 million of the increase was the result of our increased headcount, and related allocated overhead, to optimize and expand our product offerings as well as pursue innovation in identity governance. Approximately $0.5 million of the increase was the result of increased software and maintenance expenses, primarily cloud-based hosting costs related to the development of our cloud-based solution.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $2.2 million, or 30%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a $0.9 million increase in corporate staff, and related allocated overhead, to support the growth and scale of the business and a $1.3 million increase in professional service expense, including sponsor-related costs and other consulting and advisory costs.\nSales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased by $11.8 million, or 25%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Approximately $10.2 million of the increase was the result of our increased sales and marketing headcount, and related allocated overhead, to support increased penetration into our existing customer base as well as expansion into new industry verticals and geographic markets. Also contributing to the increase in sales and marketing expenses was a $1.6 million increase in expenses related to advertising and marketing programs and a $1.3 million increase in travel expenses, partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in consulting costs, and a $0.6 million decrease in amortization expense.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net increased by $0.8 million, or 55%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, increased by $3.4 million, or 87%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was the result of our entry into a new credit facility, effective in August of 2016, which increased the stated interest rate from 3.7% to 9.0%.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for each of the quarters indicated. The information for each quarter has been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements included, and reflect, in the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information contained in those statements. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future. The following quarterly financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n (1) Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows: \n\nQuarterly Trends in Revenue\nOur quarterly license revenue increased sequentially within each calendar year presented; however, we experienced a decline sequentially from the fourth quarter of each year to the first quarter of the subsequent year due to increased customer purchasing activity in each fourth quarter. We continue to experience growth in license revenue when comparing similar periods year over year as a result of our ability to attract new customers and expand our product offerings within our existing customer base.\nOur quarterly subscription revenue increased in each period presented primarily due to increases in maintenance renewals as a result of our expanding licensed customer base. Sales of subscriptions to our platform also continue to grow as a result of the expanding breadth and functionality of our platform, increasing brand awareness, and the success of our sales efforts with new and existing customers. We recognize revenue from maintenance and subscription fees ratably over the term of the contract period; therefore, changes in our sales activity in a period may not be as apparent as a change to our revenue until future periods.\nOur quarterly services and other revenue increased sequentially in each period presented. We have experienced increasing demand for our consulting and training services as our customer base, including both licensed and recurring, has continued to expand.\nQuarterly Trends in Operating Expenses\nOur operating expenses have generally increased sequentially as a result of our growth and are primarily related to increases in personnel-related costs to support our expanded operations and our continued investment in our platform infrastructure and service capabilities.\nQuarterly Key Business Metrics\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $116.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.4 million of availability under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $3.2 million of cash and cash equivalents held in our foreign subsidiaries. We do not consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, with the exception of India, to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions and have consistently applied Section 956 of the Internal Revenue Code to such earnings. As a result of applying Section 956 consistently to our intercompany cash flows, the majority of the earnings in our foreign subsidiaries represent income that was previously taxed in the United States. As a result, there would be no material income tax consequences to repatriating the cash currently held in our foreign subsidiaries. In India, we continue to invest and grow our research and development activities and have no plans to repatriate undistributed earning held in India back to the U.S. parent company, and therefore consider earnings in India to be permanently reinvested.\nWe believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, any positive cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the continued expansion of sales and marketing activities and the introduction of new solutions and product enhancements. To the extent existing cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facility are not sufficient to fund future activities, we may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness may have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict operations. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Although we are not currently a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, services or technologies, we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future, which could also require us to seek additional equity financing, incur indebtedness, or use cash resources. We have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any such acquisitions. Also, as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures.\nSince inception, we have financed operations primarily through license fees, maintenance fees, subscription fees, consulting and training fees, borrowings under our credit facility and, to a lesser degree, the sale of equity securities. Our principal uses of cash are funding operations and capital expenditures. Over the past several years, revenue has increased significantly from year to year and, as a result, cash flows from customer collections have increased. However, operating expenses have also increased as we have invested in growing our business. Our operating cash requirements may increase in the future as we continue to invest in the strategic growth of our company.\nOur Credit Facility\nOn August 16, 2016, we entered into a senior secured credit facility (our credit facility\u201d), consisting of a $115 million term loan facility and a $5 million revolving credit facility, pursuant to a credit and guaranty agreement by and among SailPoint Technologies, Inc., as the borrower, and SailPoint Technologies Intermediate Holdings, LLC and SailPoint International, Inc., as guarantors, the lenders party thereto from time to time and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as administrative agent and collateral agent, which was subsequently amended and restated on November 2, 2016 to provide for a letter of credit sub-facility with an aggregate limit equal to the lesser of $5 million and the aggregate unused amount of the revolving commitments then in effect. Our credit facility was further amended on June 28, 2017 to provide for (i) an increase to the term loan facility in an additional principal amount of $50 million to partially fund a $50.4 million dividend paid to the holders of our preferred stock and (ii) an increase to the revolving credit facility in an additional principal amount of $2.5 million, and (iii) an increase in the letter of credit sub-facility aggregate limit to the lesser of $7.5 million and the aggregate unused amount of the revolving commitments then in effect. Each of the term loan facility and revolving credit facility has a maturity of five years and will mature on August 16, 2021.\nIn fourth quarter of 2017, we amended our existing credit facility in connection with the consummation of our initial public offering. Such amendment required that we use a portion of our net proceeds from our initial public offering to repay an amount of borrowings outstanding under our term loan facility to reduce the aggregate outstanding principal amount thereof to $70.0 million (which repayment was subject to a prepayment premium of 1.50%). We used a portion of our net proceeds from our initial public offering to repay $90.0 million of such borrowings and paid the related prepayment premium of approximately $1.4 million. In addition, this payment resulted in a non-cash charge of $1.7 million on the modification and partial extinguishment of debt.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the balance outstanding under the term loan facility was $70.0 million and is included in long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. Our revolving line of credit has a face value of $7.5 million and was undrawn as of December 31, 2017. We had $1.4 million available under the revolving credit facility due to $6.1 million in standby letters of credit, issued primarily in connection with our new corporate headquarters lease. See Item 2 Properties\u201d for more information regarding our new corporate headquarters lease.\nAll of our obligations under our credit facility are guaranteed by our existing and future domestic subsidiaries and, subject to certain exceptions, secured by a security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nDuring 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $21.9 million, which consisted of a net loss of $7.6 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $17.2 million and a net change of $12.2 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges are primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $10.2 million, amortization of debt issuance costs of $0.7 million, loss on modification and partial extinguishment of debt of $1.7 million and stock-based compensation of $4.5 million. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily as a result of an increase in deferred revenue of $28.0 million due to the timing of billings and cash received in advance of revenue recognition primarily for subscription and support services, an increase in accrued expenses of $10.9 million due primarily to accrual of additional commissions and bonuses, an increase in accounts payable of $1.4 million due to timing of cash disbursements, an increase in income taxes payable of $0.6 million, partially offset by an increase in prepayments and other assets of $2.2 million, and increase in other non-current assets of $2.5 million, and an increase in accounts receivable of $24.1 million due to the timing of receipts of payments from customers.\nDuring 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $6.5 million, which consisted of a net loss of $3.2 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $8.8 million and a net change of $0.9 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges are primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $10.0 million, amortization of debt issuance costs of $0.7 million, and stock-based compensation of $0.6 million, partially offset by $2.5 million in deferred taxes. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily as a result of an increase in deferred revenue of $20.2 million due to the timing of billings and cash received in advance of revenue recognition primarily for subscription and support services and an increase in accrued expenses of $1.7 million related primarily to commissions on our subscription revenue, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $17.2 million due to the timing of receipts of payments from customers, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $3.6 million due to payments for various services to be rendered in subsequent periods and a decrease in accounts payable of $0.3 million due to timing of cash disbursements.\nDuring 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 million, which consisted of a net loss of $10.8 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $6.7 million and a change of $7.7 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges are primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $9.6 million, amortization of debt issuance costs of $0.1 million, and stock-based compensation of $0.2 million, partially offset by $3.3 million in deferred taxes. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, was primarily a result of an increase in deferred revenue of $11.6 million due to the timing of billings and cash received in advance of revenue recognition primarily for subscription and support services and an increase in accrued expenses of $3.1 million related primarily to commissions on our subscription revenue, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $5.3 million due to the timing of receipts of payments from customers, an increase in prepayments and other assets of $1.1 million due to payments for various services to be rendered in subsequent periods, and an increase in accounts payable of $0.6 million due to timing of cash disbursements.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash used in investing activities was $2.5 million, consisting of $2.7 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $0.2 million in proceeds from sales of property and equipment.\nDuring 2016, cash used in investing activities was $1.3 million, consisting of purchases of property and equipment.\nDuring 2015, cash used in investing activities was $16.3 million, consisting of $15.2 million of cash paid for acquisitions and $1.2 million in purchases of property and equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by financing activities was $78.5 million, consisting of $172.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $13.3 million, proceeds from borrowing of $50.0 million, $0.4 million of the proceeds from exercise of stock options, partially offset by $90.0 million in repayments of debt, $1.4 million of debt issuance cost, $50.4 million for preferred dividend payments, $1.4 million in debt prepayment and $0.7 million in purchase of equity shares.\nDuring 2016, cash used in financing activities was $2.0 million, consisting of $3.1 million in debt issuance costs and $0.2 million for the repurchase of common and preferred stock, partially offset by $1.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock.\nDuring 2015, cash provided by financing activities was $9.8 million, consisting of net proceeds of $10.0 million from a draw down on our prior credit facility and $0.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock, partially offset by $0.5 million for the repurchase of common and preferred stock.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements and do not have any holdings in variable interest entities, which includes special purposes entities and other structured finance entities.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our non-cancellable contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\n\n (1) The amounts included in the table above represent principal maturities only. In 2017, we used a portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to repay $90.0 million of such borrowings and paid the related prepayment premium of approximately $1.4 million. \n (2) Amounts represent estimated future interest payments on borrowings under our term loan facility, which are floating rate instruments and were estimated using the interest rate effective at December 31, 2017 of approximately 5.5% multiplied by the principal outstanding on December 31, 2017. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, and expenses and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be effected.\nWe believe that the accounting policies associated with revenue recognition, share-based compensation and income taxes are most significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates. Therefore, these are considered to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue from the following sources: (i) fees for licenses, (ii) ongoing maintenance of our licensed products and subscription fees for access to our cloud-based offering and related support and (iii) fees for consulting with our customers on configuring and optimizing the use of our products and subscription services and training services related to the implementation and configuration of our platform.\nWe recognize revenue net of sales taxes and other applicable taxes, in accordance with GAAP, when all of the following criteria are met: there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or service has been performed, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable.\nWhen non-software arrangements involve multiple elements that qualify as separate units of accounting, we allocate revenue to each deliverable based upon its relative selling price. The estimated selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) of selling price, if available; (ii) third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d) of selling price, if VSOE of selling price is not available; or (iii) best estimate of selling price ( ESP\u201d), if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE of selling price is available. When software arrangements involve multiple elements that qualify as separate units of accounting, we allocate revenue to each element based on VSOE.\nWe frequently enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple elements or deliverables. For arrangements that include both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and separable non-software deliverables as a group based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price used for allocating revenue to the deliverables as follows: (i) VSOE, (ii) TPE and (iii) ESP. Cloud-based services, and professional services related to cloud-based services, are considered to be non-software elements in our arrangements.\nVSOE of fair value for each element is based on our standard rates charged for the product or service when such product or service is sold separately or based upon the price established by our pricing committee when that product or service is not yet being sold separately. We establish VSOE for maintenance and professional services using a bell-shaped curve\u201d approach. When applying the bell-shaped curve\u201d approach, we analyze all maintenance renewal transactions over the past 12 months for that category of license and plot those data points on a bell-shaped curve to ensure that a high percentage of the data points are within an acceptable margin of the established VSOE rate. This analysis is performed quarterly on a rolling 12-month basis.\nWhen we are unable to establish a selling price for non-software arrangements using VSOE or TPE, we use ESP in the allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy, pricing factors and analysis of historical transactions.\nRevenue for software arrangements that include undelivered elements is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements for which we have established VSOE is deferred and recognized as delivered to the customer and the remaining portion of the agreement fee is recognized as license revenue upon delivery. The determination of fair value of each undelivered element in software arrangements is based on VSOE. If VSOE has not been established for certain undelivered elements in an agreement, revenue is deferred until those elements have been delivered or their VSOE has been determined.\nRevenue from maintenance and SaaS services is recognized ratably over the relevant contract period.\nServices revenue includes fees from consulting and training services. Consulting and training services are judged to not be essential to the functionality of our software and SaaS offerings, are listed separately in arrangements, are optional, and are sold separately. As a result, the Company has established VSOE or ESP for consulting and training services and they therefore qualify for separate accounting.\nIn order to account for deliverables in some multiple-deliverable arrangements as separate units of accounting, delivered elements must have standalone value. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the software or SaaS sale, and the contractual dependence of the sale on the customer's satisfaction with the professional services. Professional services sold as part of SaaS arrangements generally qualify for separate accounting.\nConsulting and training service revenue that qualifies for separate accounting is recognized as the services are performed using the proportional performance method for fixed fee consulting contracts, or when the right to the service expires. Many of our consulting contracts are billed on a time and materials basis.\nCustomer advances and billed amounts due from customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation costs related to equity awards, including stock options and incentive units, granted based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of stock-based awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period).\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. Our assumptions are as follows:\n \u2022 Expected volatility. As we have been a public company for a limited amount of time and do not have a sufficient trading history for our common stock, the expected stock price volatility for our common stock is estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for industry peers over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available. \n \u2022 Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group. \n \u2022 Expected dividend yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends to common stockholders and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero. \n \u2022 Expected term. The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. As we do not have sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term of the stock option awards granted, we base our expected term for awards issued to employees or members of our board of directors on the simplified method, which represents the average period from vesting to the expiration of the stock option. \nIn addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation for our equity awards. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected terms and forfeiture rates used for our stock-based compensation calculations on a prospective basis.\nWe analyze the facts and circumstances of each equity instrument to determine if modification accounting is required. This analysis includes a review of factors that influence the probability of vesting. If circumstances arise that have changed the probability that an equity instrument will vest, or other factors have triggered a modification, the revised fair value is calculated, and additional stock-based compensation is recognized over the remaining service period of the modified option.\nHistorically, for all periods prior to our initial public offering, the fair values of the shares of common stock underlying our stock-based awards were estimated on each grant date by our board of directors. In order to determine the fair value of our common stock underlying option grants, our board of directors considered, among other things, enterprise value of comparable public companies evaluated on a quarterly basis and the overall market and economic environment.\nFor stock awards after the completion of our initial public offering, our board of directors determines the fair value of each share of underlying common stock based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date of grant.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to federal, state and local taxes in the United States as well as in other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to current federal and state income tax in the United States.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions based on those positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We determine if the amount of available support indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. We then measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which such determination is made.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had deferred tax assets of approximately $5.6 million, primarily comprised of our net operating loss carryforwards. We have a full valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, and tax credits related primarily to research and development for our operations in the United States. We will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist. Any adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the periods in which the adjustment is determined to be required.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and identified net assets acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives are not be amortized, but rather tested for impairment annually, or more often if and when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We have determined that we operate as one reporting unit and may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not\u201d that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and whether the two-step impairment test on goodwill is required. Goodwill is tested using a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired, and thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test, used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. After a goodwill impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill shall be its new accounting basis. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference. There were no impairments of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, and our reporting unit is not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test.\nIn 2017, we elected to change the annual assessment date for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets from December 31st to October 31st because the change in date creates synergy and enhance the quality of our indefinite lived intangible assets impairment analysis.\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act ( JOBS\u201d) Act Accounting Election\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of all of the reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards, until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Our election to use the phase-in periods permitted by this election may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the longer phase-in periods under the JOBS Act and who will comply with new or revised financial accounting standards. If we were to subsequently elect to instead comply with these public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable pursuant to the JOBS Act.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a
