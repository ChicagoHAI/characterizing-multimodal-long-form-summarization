MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of financial condition as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and results of operations for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2019 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, included in this report. Average balances, including balances used in calculating certain financial ratios, are generally comprised of average daily balances. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully read Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included in this report.\nIntroduction\nOur continued focus on responsible community banking fundamentals and our strong customer relationships have enabled us to increase our market presence through growth in our loan portfolio, which is primarily funded by steady core deposit growth.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.15 billion in total assets, $751 million in total gross loans, and $1.02 billion in total deposits.\nWe believe the following were key indicators of our performance during 2019:\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Total assets increased to $1.15 billion at the end of 2019, an increase of 4.8%, from $1.09 billion at the end of 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Total deposits increased to $1.02 billion at the end of 2019, an increase of 3.4%, from $986 million at the end of 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Total net loans increased to $741 million at the end of 2019, an increase of 5.5%, from $702 million at the end of 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Net interest income increased to $41.0 million in 2019, an increase of $2.5 million or 6.4%, compared to $38.6 million in 2018, mainly as a result of growth of our loan and investment portfolios.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Provision for loan losses decreased by $10,000 to $545,000 in 2019, compared to $555,000 in 2018, mainly due to slightly higher loan growth in the prior year, as overall credit quality remains strong.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> The ratio of total non-performing loans to total loans increased slightly to 0.15% at December 31, 2019 from 0.13% at December 31, 2018. Management considers the size of the ratio of non-performing assets to total loans to be low and manageable, and reserves have been taken appropriately.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Total noninterest income increased to $5.0 million in 2019, an increase of 7.1%, from $4.7 million in 2018, which is mainly attributable to service charges and debit card fee income generated from our growing deposit base.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Total noninterest expense increased from $27.4 million in 2018 to $28.8 million in 2019, primarily due to one new branch that opened in 2018, two branch relocations in 2018, and increased general operating costs to support our growing loan and deposit portfolios.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Provision from income taxes increased by $390,000 to $4.2 million in 2019, mainly due to the higher pre-tax income, as our effective tax rate was relatively static compared to the prior year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese items, as well as other factors, contributed to the increase in net income for 2019 to $12.5 million from $11.5 million in 2018, which translates into $1.54 per diluted share in 2019 as compared to $1.42 per diluted share in 2018.\nOver the past several years, our network of branches and loan production offices have expanded geographically. We currently maintain seventeen full-service offices. We intend to continue our growth strategy in future years through the opening of additional branches and loan production offices as our needs and resources permit.\n2020 Outlook\nAs we begin our strategic business plan for 2020, we remained focused on relationship-based expansion throughout our market area. We plan to continue to focus on increasing our loan-to-deposit ratio to expand our net interest margin, while attempting to control expenses and credit losses.\nFavorable trends in our economy prompted the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, or FOMC, to increase the target federal funds by 0.25% in 2016, 0.75% in 2017 and 1.00% in 2018, which was followed by a decrease of 0.75% in 2019. The increased market interest rates from 2016 through 2018 had a positive impact on net interest income mainly due to growth of earning assets and the fact that our balance sheet is slightly asset sensitive. In 2019, that trend reversed and we recognized yield compression on our earning assets due to the FOMC rate cuts. We expect this negative impact to continue if there are further interest rate cuts in 2020. The potential compression of net interest income and net interest margin could occur if interest rates remain static or decline, given that our balance sheet is asset sensitive to interest rate changes primarily due to the number of variable rate loans and a high level of interest-earning cash balances. This could in turn result in further decrease on the yield of earning assets compared to the cost of deposits and other funds, which remain at historic lows and cannot reasonably be further reduced.\nGiven our asset sensitive balance sheet, we expect our net interest income to benefit from interest rate increases, but we expect any such benefit to be proportional to the increase in rates. If we experience an increase in our yield on earnings assets, we could then determine to increase the interest rates we pay on our deposit accounts or change our promotional or other interest rates on new deposits in marketing activation programs to attempt to achieve a certain net interest margin. That said, in light of the current economic environment, if the rates increase is modest, it may not be possible to manage the interest margin in this manner, as competitive pressures may dictate that we increase deposit rates at a faster rate than the earning assets increase, thereby offsetting any gains to the net interest margin. The economies and real estate markets in our primary market areas are expected to continue to be significant determinants of the quality of our assets in future periods and, thus, our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nFor 2020, management remains focused on the above challenges and opportunities and other factors affecting the business similar to the factors driving the 2019 results as discussed in this section.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method, although the economics of our transactions would be the same.\nManagement has determined the following accounting policies to be critical:\nAsset Impairment Judgments\nCertain of our assets are carried in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to recognize impairment of such assets. We periodically perform analyses to test for impairment of various assets. In addition to our impairment analyses related to loans, another significant impairment analysis relates to other than temporary declines in the value of our securities.\nLoans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired and are carried at fair value or below. Appraisals are done periodically on impaired loans and if required, an allowance is established based on the fair value of collateral less the cost related to liquidation of the collateral. In some circumstances, an impaired loan may be charged off to bring the carrying value to fair value.\nOther real estate assets ( OREO\u201d) acquired through, or in lieu of, foreclosure, are held-for-sale and are initially recorded at the fair value, less selling costs. Any write-downs to fair value at the time of transfer to OREO are charged to the allowance for loan losses, subsequent to foreclosure. Appraisals or evaluations are then done periodically thereafter, charging any additional write-downs or valuation allowances to the appropriate expense accounts.\nNet realizable value of the underlying collateral is the fair value of the collateral, less estimated selling costs and any prior liens. Appraisals, recent comparable sales, offers and listing prices are factored in when valuing the collateral. We review and verify the qualifications and licenses of the certified general appraisers used for appraising commercial properties or certified residential appraisers for residential properties. Real estate appraisals may utilize a combination of approaches including replacement cost, sales comparison and the income approach. Comparable sales and income data are analyzed by the appraisers and adjusted to reflect differences between them and the subject property such as type, leasing status and physical condition. When the appraisals are received, management reviews the assumptions and methodology utilized in the appraisal, as well as the overall resulting value in conjunction with independent data sources, such as recent market data and industry-wide statistics. We generally use a 6% discount for selling costs which is applied to all properties, regardless of size. Appraised values may be adjusted to reflect changes in market conditions that have occurred subsequent to the appraisal date, or for revised estimates regarding the timing or cost of the property sale. These adjustments are based on qualitative judgments made by management on a case-by-case basis.\nOur available for sale portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity. We conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the value of any security has declined below its carrying value and whether such decline is other than temporary. If such decline is deemed other than temporary, we would adjust the carrying amount of the security by writing down the security to fair value through a charge to current period income for the amount that is determined to be other than temporary . The fair values of our securities are significantly affected by changes in interest rates.\nIn general, as interest rates rise, we expect that the fair value of fixed-rate securities should decrease; as interest rates fall, we expect that the fair value of fixed-rate securities should increase. With significant changes in interest rates, we evaluate our intent and ability to hold the security for a sufficient time to recover the recorded principal balance. Estimated fair values for securities are based on published or securities dealers' market values. Market volatility is unpredictable and may impact such values.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nCredit risk is inherent in the business of lending and making commercial loans. Accounting for our allowance for loan losses involves significant judgment and assumptions by management and is based on historical data and management's view of the current economic environment. At least on a quarterly basis, our management reviews the methodology and adequacy of allowance for loan losses and reports its assessment to the Board of Directors for its review and approval.\nThe allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable incurred losses with regard to our loans. Our loan loss provision for each period is dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loans, delinquencies, management's assessment of the quality of the loans, the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in our market area. We base our allowance for loan losses on an estimation of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio.\nOur methodology for assessing loan loss allowances are intended to reduce the differences between estimated and actual losses and involves a detailed analysis of our loan portfolio, in three phases:\n\u25cf the specific review of individual loans,\n\u25cf the segmenting and review of loan pools with similar characteristics, and\n\u25cf our judgmental estimate based on various subjective factors:\nThe first phase of our methodology involves the specific review of individual loans to identify and measure impairment. We evaluate each loan by use of a risk rating system, except for homogeneous loans, such as automobile loans and home mortgages. Specific risk rated loans are deemed impaired if all amounts, including principal and interest, will likely not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the related loan agreement. Impairment for commercial and real estate loans is measured either based on the present value of the loan's expected future cash flows or, if collection on the loan is collateral dependent, the estimated fair value of the collateral, less selling and holding costs.\nThe second phase involves the segmenting of the remainder of the risk rated loan portfolio into groups or pools of loans, together with loans with similar characteristics, for evaluation. We determine the calculated loss ratio to each loan pool based on its historical net losses and benchmark it against the levels of other peer banks.\nIn the third phase, we consider relevant internal and external factors that may affect the collectability of loan portfolio and each group of loan pool. The factors considered are, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf concentration of credits,\n\u25cf nature and volume of the loan portfolio,\n\u25cf delinquency trends,\n\u25cf non-accrual loan trends,\n\u25cf problem loan trends,\n\u25cf loss and recovery trends,\n\u25cf quality of loan review,\n\u25cf lending and management staff,\n\u25cf lending policies and procedures,\n\u25cf economic and business conditions, and\n\u25cf other external factors.\nOur management estimates the probable effect of such conditions based on our judgment, experience and known or anticipated trends. Such estimation may be reflected as an additional allowance to each group of loans, if necessary. Management reviews these conditions with our senior credit officers. To the extent that any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date, management's estimate of the effect of such condition may be reflected as a specific allowance applicable to such credit or portfolio segment. Where any of these conditions is not evidenced by a specific, identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date, management's evaluation of the inherent loss related to such condition is reflected in the unallocated allowance.\nCentral to our credit risk management and our assessment of appropriate loss allowance is our loan risk rating system. Under this system, the originating credit officer assigns borrowers an initial risk rating based on a thorough analysis of each borrower's financial capacity in conjunction with industry and economic trends. Approvals are made based upon the amount of inherent credit risk specific to the transaction and are reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit administration personnel. Credits are monitored by line and credit administration personnel for deterioration in a borrower's financial condition which may impact the ability of the borrower to perform under the contract. Although management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loans, specific loan pools, and off-balance sheet credit exposures (which are reported separately as part of other liabilities), the adequacy of the allowance is considered in its entirety.\nIt is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate for risks inherent in the overall loan portfolio, however, the loan portfolio can be adversely affected if the state of California's economic conditions and its real estate market in our general market area were to further deteriorate or weaken. Additionally, further weakness of a prolonged nature in the agricultural and general economy would have a negative impact on the local market. The effect of such economic events, although uncertain and unpredictable at this time, could result in an increase in the levels of nonperforming loans and additional loan losses, which could adversely affect our future growth and profitability. No assurance of the level of predicted credit losses can be given with any certainty.\nNon-Accrual Loan Policy\nInterest on loans is credited to income as earned and is accrued only if deemed collectible. Accrual of interest is discontinued when a loan is over 90 days delinquent or if management believes that collection is highly uncertain. Generally, payments received on nonaccrual loans are recorded as principal reductions. Interest income is recognized after all principal has been repaid or an improvement in the condition of the loan has occurred that would warrant resumption of interest accruals.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled using the liability method. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and the state of California. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal or state/local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2015.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. We base our fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Securities available for sale, derivatives, and loans held for sale, if any, are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to record certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis, such as certain impaired loans held for investment and securities held to maturity that are other-than-temporarily impaired. These non-recurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of individual assets due to application of lower-of-cost or market accounting.\nWe have established and documented a process for determining fair value. We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements. Whenever there is no readily available market data, management uses its best estimate and assumptions in determining fair value, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, our recorded earnings or disclosures could have been materially different from those reflected in these financial statements. For detailed information on our use of fair value measurements and our related valuation methodologies, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU is a converged standard involving FASB and International Financial Reporting Standards that provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers across transactions and industries. The core principal of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to reflect the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount and at a time that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Subsequent updates related to Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) are as follows:\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> August 2015 ASU No. 2015-14 - Deferral of the Effective Date, institutes a one-year deferral of the effective date of this amendment to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> March 2016 ASU No. 2016-08 - Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and on the use of indicators that assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> April 2016 ASU No. 2016-10 - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, provides guidance in determining performance obligations in a contract with a customer and clarifies whether a promise to grant a license provides a right to access or the right to use intellectual property.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> May 2016 ASU No. 2016-12 - Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, gives further guidance on assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTopic 606 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2018 and did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. No additional disaggregated revenue disclosures are necessary because interest income sources are scoped out and there are no additional significant non-interest income sources to break out on the consolidated statements of income.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The amendments in this ASU make improvements to GAAP related to financial instruments that include the following as applicable to us.\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Equity investments, except for those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee, are required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment - if impairment exists, this requires measuring the investment at fair value.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Eliminates the requirement for public companies to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is currently required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Public companies will be required to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> The reporting entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity's other deferred tax assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nASU 2016-01 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. This ASU was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2018 and impacted the Company's consolidated financial statement disclosures but did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This ASU was issued to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities, including leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP, on the balance sheet and requiring additional disclosures of key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and was adopted under the current period adjustment method, which allows for prior period accumulated amounts to be recorded as of the effective date. The Company adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2019 and determined that the gross-up of its balance sheet from recording a right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) asset and a lease liability for each lease as a result of adopting this ASU, did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated financial statements. See Note 13 for further discussion of the Company's leases and the impact of this ASU.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). This update changes the methodology used by financial institutions under current U.S. GAAP to recognize credit losses in the financial statements. Currently, U.S. GAAP requires the use of the incurred loss model, whereby financial institutions recognize in current period earnings, incurred credit losses and those inherent in the financial statements, as of the date of the balance sheet. This guidance results in a new model for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses, commonly referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss ( CECL\u201d) model. Under the CECL model, financial institutions are required to estimate future credit losses and recognize those losses in current period earnings. The amendments within the update are effective for fiscal years and all interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. In October 2019, FASB approved an amendment that will delay the adoption of this ASU for three years for certain entities including the Company since we are classified as a Small Reporting Company. Upon adoption of the amendments within this update on January 1, 2023, the Company will be required to make a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this update will have on its financial statements. While the Company has not quantified the impact of this ASU, it does expect changing from the current incurred loss model to an expected loss model should result in an earlier recognition of losses.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Subtopic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The provisions of the update eliminate the existing second step of the goodwill impairment test which provides for the allocation of reporting unit fair value among existing assets and liabilities, with the net leftover amount representing the implied fair value of goodwill. In replacement of the existing goodwill impairment rule, the update will provide that impairment should be recognized as the excess of any of the reporting unit's goodwill over the fair value of the reporting unit. Under the provisions of this update, the amount of the impairment is limited to the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill. For public business entities that are SEC filers, the amendments of the update will become effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We do not expect that the ASU will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The ASU was issued to address certain stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The ASU provides companies with the option to reclassify stranded tax effects within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings in each period in which the effect of the change from the newly enacted corporate tax rate is recorded. The amount of the reclassification would be calculated on the basis of the difference between the historical and newly enacted tax rates for deferred tax liabilities and assets related to items within accumulated other comprehensive income. The ASU requires companies to disclose its accounting policy related to releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income, whether it has elected to reclassify the stranded tax effects, and information about the other income tax effects that are reclassified. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods, therein, and early adoption is permitted for public business entities for which financial statements have not yet been issued. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the ASU and made a reclassification adjustment of $163,000 from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings on the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity, related to the stranded tax effects due to the change in the federal corporate tax rate applied on the unrealized gains (losses) on investments on a portfolio basis, to reflect the provisions of this ASU.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Subtopic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The primary focus of ASU 2018-13 is to improve the effectiveness of the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The changes affect all companies that are required to include fair value measurement disclosures. In general, the amendments in ASU 2018-13 are effective for all entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. An entity is permitted to early adopt the removed or modified disclosures upon the issuance of ASU 2018-13 and may delay adoption of the additional disclosures, which are required for public companies only, until their effective date. The guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842): Codification Improvements. This ASU addresses two lessor implementation issues and clarifies that lessees and lessors are exempt from certain interim disclosure requirements associated with adopting ASU 2016-02. The amendments related to the lessor implementation issues are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. As the ASU's amendments applicable to us only relate to disclosures, the adoption of ASU 2019-01 will not impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments that clarifies and improves areas of guidance related to recently issued standards on credit losses, hedging and recognition and measurement. The provisions of this ASU are effective January 1, 2020 and contain various methods of adoption. We do not expect that the ASU will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief. This ASU allows an option for entities to irrevocably elect the fair value option on an instrument-by-instrument basis for eligible financial assets measured at amortized cost basis upon adoption of the credit loss standards. This amendment provides relief for those entities electing the fair value option on newly originated or purchased financial assets, while maintaining existing similar financial assets at amortized cost, avoiding the requirement to maintain dual measurement methods for similar assets. The fair value option does not apply to held-to-maturity debt securities. The effective date for this ASU is the same as for ASU 2016-13, as discussed above. We will evaluate this ASU in conjunction with ASU 2016-13 to determine its impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nResults of Operations\nThe Company earns income from two primary sources. The first is net interest income, which is interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. The second is noninterest income, which primarily consists of deposit service charges and fees, the increase in cash surrender value of life insurance, investment advisory service fee income and mortgage commissions. The majority of the Company's noninterest expenses are operating costs that relate to providing a full range of banking services to our customers.\nOverview\nWe recorded net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $12,489,000 or $1.54 per diluted share compared to $11,537,000 or $1.42 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase of $2,466,000 in net interest income, mainly from the growth of our loan and investment portfolios. Non-interest income increased by $335,000 in 2019, mainly as a result of increase service charges and debit card fee income. The provision for loan losses decreased by $10,000 in 2019 due to lower loan growth. Non-interest expense increased by $1,469,000 associated with two branch relocations and one de novo branch opened in 2018, in addition to general operating overhead increases to support the growth of our loan and deposit portfolios.\nHighlights of the financial results are presented in the following table:\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of and for the years ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For the period:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income available to common shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,094 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income per common share:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average common equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.78 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.26 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.41 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.15 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.08 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.91 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common stock dividend payout ratio of earnings during the period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.53 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.31 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.23 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Efficiency ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.95 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61.37 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.66 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> At period end:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Book value per common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.09 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11.21 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,147,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,094,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,034,852 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>750,985 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>711,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>662,544 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,019,929 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>986,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>938,882 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loan-to-deposit ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72.66 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.18 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69.55 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nOur primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between interest and fees derived from earning assets and interest paid on liabilities obtained to fund those assets. Our net interest income is affected by changes in the level and mix of interest-earning assets and interest- bearing liabilities, referred to as volume changes. Our net interest income is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities, referred to as rate changes. Interest rates charged on our loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans, the supply of money available for lending purposes and competitive factors. Those factors are, in turn, affected by general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control, such as federal economic policies, the general supply of money in the economy, legislative tax policies, governmental budgetary matters, and the actions of the Federal Reserve Board.\nFor a detailed analysis of interest income and interest expense, see the Average Balance Sheets\u201d and the

<td> Represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet interest income, on a fully tax equivalent basis ( FTE\u201d), increased $2,457,000 or 6.3% to $41,708,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $39,251,000 in 2018. Net interest spread and net interest margin were 4.03% and 4.13%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 3.80% and 3.89%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018. This upward trend is mainly due to the increase in earning asset yield as described below and a change in mix of earning assets with higher loan balances and lower cash balances.\nOur earning asset yield increased 24 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018. The yield on loans recognized an increase of 4 basis points for 2019 compared to 2018, which was primarily due to loan repricing of variable rate loans, higher rate indexes on new loans and an increase in loan fees. The FOMC cut rates three times in 2019 with the first one in August, so rates remained at higher levels for the majority of 2019, as compared to 2018. The increase in loan yield was complemented by growth in the loan portfolio average balance of $59,359,000 in 2019 as compared to 2018. During the same period, average cash balances decreased by $56,139,000, representing a shift in the earning asset mix from low-yielding cash balances to higher yielding loan balances. Lastly, as was the case for all earning assets, the FOMC interest rate hikes in 2017 and 2018 had a positive impact to our cash balances in particular, as evidenced by the increase of 17 basis points during 2019 compared to 2018.\nThe cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities increased slightly to 0.26% in 2019 compared to 0.25% in 2018 as our excess liquidity has allowed us to keep deposit rates low on a relative basis. Average non-interest-bearing demand deposit balances increased by $38,303,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, which contributed in maintaining our low cost of funds.\nIn spite of the interest margin expansion the Company has recognized over recent years, there are certain factors that have limited net interest margin expansion and could possibly result in in net interest margin compression if rates were to fall, which include: 1) deposit interest rates remain at historic lows from which they cannot reasonably be further reduced, 2) competition in the lending market restrict significant increases in new loan rates, and 3) deposit growth has out-paced loan growth in recent years resulting in higher interest-bearing cash balances, which yielded approximately 2.09% on average during 2019.\nChanges in volume resulted in an increase in net interest income (on a FTE basis) of $1,994,000 for the year of 2019 compared to the year 2018, and changes in interest rates and the mix resulted in an increase in net interest income (on a FTE basis) of $463,000 for the year 2019 versus the year 2018. Management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin.\nMarket rates are in part based on the FOMC target Federal funds interest rate (the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term borrowings). The change in the Federal funds sold rates is the result of target rate changes implemented by the FOMC. In 2008, there were seven downward adjustments to the target rate totaling 325 basis points, bringing the target interest rate to a historic low with a range of 0% to 0.25% where it remained until December 2015 when the FOMC increased by 0.25% to a range of 0.25% to 0.50%. The FOMC increased the Federal funds rate again in December 2016 by 0.25% to a range of 0.50% to 0.75%. In 2017, the FOMC increased the Federal funds rate by 0.25% on three occasions resulting in a range of 1.25% to 1.50% as of December 31, 2017. In 2018, the FOMC increased the Federal funds rate by 0.25% on four occasions resulting in a range of 2.25% to 2.50% as of December 31, 2018. In 2019, the FOMC decreased the Federal funds rate by 0.25% on three occasions resulting in a range of 1.50% to 1.75% as of December 31, 2019.\nRate/Volume Analysis\nThe following table below sets forth certain information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense of the Company for the periods indicated. For each category of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (change in average volume multiplied by old rate); and (ii) changes in rates (change in rate multiplied by old average volume). Changes in rate/volume (change in rate multiplied by the change in volume) have been allocated to the changes due to volume and rate in proportion to the absolute value of the changes due to volume and rate prior to the allocation.\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Rate/Volume Analysis of Net Interest Income\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The Company establishes an allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings, which are shown in the consolidated statements of income as the provision for loan losses. Specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are promptly charged off against the allowance. The Company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that it considers to be adequate to provide for credit losses inherent in its loan portfolio. Management determines the level of the allowance by performing a quarterly analysis that considers concentrations of credit, past loss experience, current economic conditions, the amount and composition of the loan portfolio (including nonperforming and potential problem loans), estimated fair value of underlying collateral, and other information relevant to assessing the risk of loss inherent in the loan portfolio such as loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, and delinquencies. As a result of management's analysis, a range of the potential amount of the allowance for loan losses is determined.\nThe Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $545,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019 mainly to provide an adequate loan loss reserve for the new loan funding, as compared to provisions of $555,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Nonperforming loans were $1,103,000 at December 31, 2019 and $920,000 at December 31, 2018, or 0.15% and 0.13%, respectively, of total loans. Nonperforming loans are primarily in nonperforming real estate construction and development loans. The allowance for loan losses was $9,146,000 and $8,685,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, or 1.22% of total loans for each period. The strong credit quality has resulted in relatively low net charge-off totals of $84,000 in 2019 and $36,000 in 2018.\nThe Company will continue to monitor the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and make additions to the allowance in accordance with the analysis referred to above. Because of uncertainties inherent in estimating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, actual results may differ from management's estimate of credit losses and the related allowance.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table sets forth a summary of noninterest income for the periods indicated:\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Amount)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Amount)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(%) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges on deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,619 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debit card transaction fee income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings on cash surrender value of life insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>602 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage commissions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gains on sales and calls of securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of other real estate owned\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,084,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,067,483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest income as a % of average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest income was $5,047,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $4,712,000 for the year 2018. Service charge income and debit card transaction fee income increased to $1,619,000 and $1,297,000, respectively, for the year 2019 compared to $1,549,000 and $1,185,000 for the year 2018, as a result of the increase in the aggregate number of transaction deposit accounts and corresponding service fee income. Earnings on the cash surrender value of life insurance recognized an increase of $91,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, due to four new life insurance policies that began earning revenue in July of 2018. Mortgage commissions have decreased by $22,000 for the year 2019, as compared to 2018, as a result of the decreased demand for home purchases and refinancing. Gains on called and sold securities increased from $81,000 in 2018 to $138,000 in 2019, mainly from one security that was called during the first quarter of 2019. There was one sale of an OREO property in 2018, which resulted in a gain of $193,000 for 2018 as compared to no sales or corresponding gains in 2019. In 2019, other income increased by $220,000, which was attributable to an unrealized gain on equity securities of $101,000 in 2019, as compared to an unrealized loss of $90,000 in 2018. The Company continues to evaluate its deposit product offerings with the intention of continuing to expand its offerings to the consumer and business depositors.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table sets forth a summary of noninterest expenses for the periods indicated:\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Amount)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Amount)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(%) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data processing fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,907 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,707 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Regulatory assessments (FDIC & DBO)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,777 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,313 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,084,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,067,483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest expenses as a % of average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest expense was $28,847,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1,469,000 or 5.4% compared to $27,378,000 for the year ended 2018. Salaries and employee benefits increased by $1,113,000 in 2019 to $17,400,000 compared to the prior year. To support loan and deposit growth, we increased our full-time equivalent staff by five as of December 31, 2019 compared to last year, which combined with the Sacramento branch staffing expense, resulted in increased salary expense and group medical insurance benefits. The Sacramento branch opened its doors in September 2018, and therefore we recognized higher operating expenses in 2019 as the branch was in operation for the full year compared to only four months in 2018.\nOccupancy expense realized a decrease of $138,000 in 2019 compared to the prior year, primarily from rent and other overhead expenses. The 2018 total includes a non-recurring charge of $85,000 for the remaining lease obligation on our vacated Turlock branch, which was relocated during the second quarter of 2018. In addition, depreciation expense on fixed assets decreased by $96,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, due to certain assets that became fully depreciated.\nData processing costs increased in 2019 over 2018 by $200,000, primarily due to servicing costs on the growing number of loan and deposit accounts.\nFDIC and DBO regulatory assessments decreased by $170,000 to $270,000 in 2019 compared to $440,000 in 2018. In January 2019, the FDIC sent notification that small banks less than $10 billion would receive assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%, to be applied when the reserve ratio reached 1.38%. That threshold has since been met and therefore the Company did not recognize any expense for FDIC assessments during the third quarter of 2019. Additionally, the initial base assessment rate for financial institutions varies based on the overall risk profile of the institution as defined by the FDIC and our risk profile was stable during 2018 and 2019, with a slight improvement for both years in asset quality metrics that are included in the risk profile. The result was a reduction in our assessment rate in 2019; however, we expect this should be offset by deposit growth in 2020. The decrease to our recorded expense in 2019 was despite the higher deposit balances in 2019, as the FDIC assessment rates are applied to average quarterly total liabilities as the primary basis. Management is also aware of the potential for further assessment credits to be recognized in future periods if the FDIC reserve ratio remains above 1.38%.\nOther operating expenses increased by $464,000 or 8.7% to $5,777,000 in 2019, primarily as a result of various general operating expense increases required to support our growing business portfolios and compliance mandates, some of which included telephone and data communications, software license fees, provision for losses on undisbursed loan commitments, audit expenses and director expenses.\nManagement anticipates that noninterest expense should continue to increase as we continue to grow, and management believes the Company's administration as currently set up is scalable to handle future deposit growth. However, management remains committed to cost-control and efficiency, and we expect to keep these increases to a minimum relative to growth.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe reported a provision for income taxes of $4,200,000 and $3,810,000 for the years 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 25.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 24.8% for the year 2018. These provisions reflect accruals for taxes at the applicable rates for federal income tax and California franchise tax based upon reported pre-tax income and adjusted for the effects of all permanent differences between income for tax and financial reporting purposes (such as earnings on qualified municipal securities, BOLI and certain tax-exempt loans).\nFinancial Condition\nThe Company's total assets were $1,147,785,000 at December 31, 2019 compared to $1,094,887,000 at December 31, 2018, an increase of $52,898,000 or 4.8%. Net loans increased $38,827,000, investments decreased $16,433,000, bank premises and equipment increased $292,000, interest receivable and other assets increased $3,265,000, while cash and cash equivalents increased $21,449,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018.\nLoans gross of the allowance for loan losses and deferred fees were $750,985,000 at December 31, 2019, compared to $711,902,000 at December 31, 2018, an increase of $39,083,000 or 5.5%. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $52,483,000 or 9.5% in commercial real estate loans, a decrease of $4,548,000 or 5.5% in commercial and industrial loans, an increase of $866,000 or 2.3% in consumer loans and consumer residential loans and a decrease of $9,718,000 or 25.5% in agriculture loans. The composition of the loan portfolio categories remained relatively unchanged as a percentage of total loans, with commercial real estate comprising 81% and 78% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nDeposits increased $33,434,000 or 3.4% to $1,019,929,000 at December 31, 2019 compared to $986,495,000 at December 31, 2018. Money Market and Time Deposits decreased by $39,240,000 and $3,385,000, respectively, while Demand and Savings increased by $70,185,000 and $5,874,000, respectively, as of December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018.\nThere were no short-term borrowing or long-term debt outstanding balances at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Company uses short-term borrowings, primarily short-term FHLB advances, to fund short-term liquidity needs and manage net interest margin.\nEquity increased $13,532,000 or 13.7% to $112,570,000 at December 31, 2019, compared to $99,038,000 at December 31, 2018.\nInvestment Activities\nInvestments are a key source of interest income. Management of our investment portfolio is set in accordance with strategies developed and overseen by our Investment Committee. Investment balances, including cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, are subject to change over time based on our asset/liability funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives. Our liquidity levels take into consideration anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of credits and are maintained at levels management believes are appropriate to assure future flexibility in meeting anticipated funding needs.\nCash Equivalents and Interest-bearing Deposits in other Financial Institutions\nThe Company holds federal funds sold, unpledged available-for-sale securities and salable government guaranteed loans to help meet liquidity requirements and provide temporary holdings until the funds can be otherwise deployed or invested. As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, we had $13,785,000 and $9,720,000, respectively, in federal funds sold.\nInvestment Securities\nManagement of our investment securities portfolio focuses on providing an adequate level of liquidity and establishing an interest rate-sensitive position, while earning an adequate level of investment income without taking undue risk. Investment securities that we intend to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity securities, and all other investment securities are classified as either available-for-sale or equity securities. Currently, all of our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale, except for one mutual fund classified as an equity security.\nThe fair value of the equity security was $3,297,000 and $3,106,000 at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Consistent with ASU 2016-01, equity securities are carried at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of income. Accordingly, the Company recognized an unrealized gain of $101,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to an unrealized loss of $90,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOur available for sale investment securities holdings decreased by $16,624,000 or 8.0%, to $190,088,000 at December 31, 2019, compared to holdings of $206,712,000 at December 31, 2018.

At December 31, 2019, three U.S. agencies, eight asset backed securities, two SBA pools and two corporate debts make up the total debt securities in a loss position for less than 12 months. Management periodically evaluates each available-for-sale investment security in an unrealized loss position to determine if the impairment is temporary or other than temporary. This evaluation encompasses various factors including, the nature of the investment, the cause of the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, credit ratings and other credit related factors such as third party guarantees and the volatility of the security's fair value. Management has determined that no investment security is other than temporarily impaired. The unrealized losses are due primarily to interest rate changes and the Company does not intend to sell the securities and it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the earlier of the forecasted recovery or the maturity of the underlying investment security. As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any investment securities that constituted 10% or more of the stockholders' equity of any third-party issuer.\nThe following table summarizes the maturity and

intervals of the outstanding loans in our portfolio, as of December 31, 2019. In addition, the table shows the distribution of such loans between those with variable or floating interest rates and those with fixed or predetermined interest rates. The large majority of the variable rate loans are tied to independent indices (such as the Wall Street Journal prime rate or a Treasury Constant Maturity Rate). Substantially all loans with an original term of more than five years have provisions for the fixed rates to reset, or convert to a variable rate, after one, three or five years and are therefore classified as a variable rate loan in the table below.\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Loan Maturities and Repricing Schedule\n\t\t\tAt December 31, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In Thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Within\n\t\t\tOne Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After One But\nWithin\n\t\t\tFive Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After\n\t\t\tFive Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>324,926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>177,909 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>607,002 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and industrial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,098 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,704 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,274 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,647 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agriculture\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,974 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,358 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred loan fees and costs, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(172 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(387 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(233 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(792 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loans, net of deferred loan fees and costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>162,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>367,055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>220,553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>750,193 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans with variable (floating) interest rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>269,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>490,997 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans with predetermined (fixed) interest rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>97,476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>132,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>259,196 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe majority of the properties taken as collateral are located in Northern California. We employ strict guidelines regarding the use of collateral located in less familiar market areas. Positive trends in Northern California real estate values, the low loan-to-value ratios in our commercial real estate portfolio, and the high percentage of owner-occupied properties further solidify our credit quality position.\nNonperforming Assets\nFinancial institutions generally have a certain level of exposure to credit quality risk and could potentially receive less than a full return of principal and interest if a debtor becomes unable or unwilling to repay. Since loans are the most significant assets of the Company and generate the largest portion of its revenues, the Company's management of credit quality risk is focused primarily on loan quality. Banks have generally suffered their most severe earnings declines due to customers' inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debts and/or downturns in national and regional economies which have brought about declines in overall property values. In addition, certain debt securities that the Company may purchase have the potential of declining in value if the obligor's financial capacity to repay deteriorates.\nNonperforming assets consist of loans on non-accrual status, loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest, loans restructured, where the terms of repayment have been renegotiated resulting in a reduction or deferral of interest or principal and OREO.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days past due, unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection. The past due loans may or may not be adequately collateralized, but collection efforts are continuously pursued. Loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some changes in financial status, causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms, and where we believe the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and repay the loan in full. OREO consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means and which management intends to offer for sale.\nThe Company had nonperforming loans of $1.1 million at December 31, 2019, as compared to $0.9 million at December 31, 2018. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.15% and 0.13% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIn addition, the Company held one OREO property as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, a residential land property that was acquired through foreclosure that was written down to a zero balance because the public utilities have not been obtainable, thereby rendering these land lots unmarketable at this time.\nManagement believes that the reserve provided for nonperforming loans, together with the tangible collateral, were adequate as of December 31, 2019. See Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d below for further discussion. Except as disclosed above, as of December 31, 2019, management was not aware of any material credit problems of borrowers that would cause it to have serious doubts about the ability of a borrower to comply with the present loan payment terms. However, no assurance can be given that credit problems may exist that may not have been brought to the attention of management, or that credit problems may not arise in the future.\nThe following table provides information with respect to the components of our nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Additional interest income of approximately $62,000 and $68,000 would have been recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, if these loans had been paid in accordance with their original terms.\n(2) A restructured loan\u201d is one the terms of which were renegotiated to provide a concession because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nIn anticipation of credit risk inherent in our lending business, we set aside allowances through charges to earnings. Such charges are not only made for the outstanding loan portfolio, but also for off-balance sheet items, such as commitments to extend credits or letters of credit. The charges made for the outstanding loan portfolio are credited to the allowance for loan losses, whereas charges for off-balance sheet items are credited to the reserve for off-balance sheet items, which is presented as a component of other liabilities. The provision for loan losses is discussed in the section entitled Provision for Loan Losses\u201d above.\nThe balance of our allowance for loan losses is management's best estimate of the probable losses inherent in the portfolio. The ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the real estate market, changes in interest rate and economic and political environments.\nIn recent years, the economic recovery has had a positive impact on the financial stability of our borrowers resulting in improvements in credit quality of our loan portfolio which has allowed us to reduce the reserve for loan losses as a percentage of gross loans. In 2019, we have continued to benefit from the improved credit quality but due to loan growth, we recognized an increase of $461,000 in the allowance for loan losses to $9,146,000 at December 31, 2019, as compared with $8,685,000 at December 31, 2018. In 2019, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans stabilized at 1.22% as of December 31, 2019 corresponding to our improved credit quality and loan growth, as compared to 1.22% as of December 31, 2018. Based on the current conditions of the loan portfolio, management believes that the $9,146,000 allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio. No assurance can be given, however, that adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the portfolio.\nDiversification, low loan-to-values, strong credit quality and enhanced credit monitoring contribute to a reduction in the portfolio's overall risk in recent years and help to offset the economic risk. We continue to monitor the impact of the economic environment, and adjustments to the provision for loan loss will be made accordingly. During 2019, the Company recognized net loan charge-offs of $84,000 as compared to $36,000 in 2018.\nManagement reviews these conditions with our senior credit officers. To the extent that any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date, management's estimate of the effect of such condition may be reflected as a specific allowance applicable to such credit or portfolio segment. Where any of these conditions is not evidenced by a specific, identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date, management's evaluation of the inherent loss related to such condition is reflected in the unallocated allowance. Although management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loan categories, the adequacy of the allowance is considered in its entirety.\nOur allowance for loan losses consisted of amounts allocated to three phases of our methodology for assessing loan loss allowances, as follows (see details of methodology for assessing allowance for loan losses in the section entitled Critical Accounting Policies\u201d):\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Phase of Methodology\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specific review of individual loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>680 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Review of portfolio based on loss trends and current economic climate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,051 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Review of portfolio based on inherent risk and other subjective factors\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,954 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,685 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Components of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nAs stated previously in \"Critical Accounting Policies,\" the overall allowance consists of a specific allowance for individually identified impaired loans, an allowance factor for categories of credits with similar characteristics and trends, and an allowance for changing environmental factors.\nThe first component, the specific allowance, results from the analysis of identified problem credits and the evaluation of sources of repayment including collateral, as applicable. Through management's ongoing loan grading process, individual loans are identified that have conditions that indicate the borrower may be unable to pay all amounts due under the contractual terms. These loans are evaluated individually by management and specified allowances for loan losses are established when the discounted cash flows of future payments or collateral value of collateral-dependent loans are lower than the recorded investment in the loan. Generally, with problem credits that are collateral-dependent, we obtain appraisals of the collateral at least annually. We may obtain appraisals more frequently if we believe the collateral value is subject to market volatility, if a specific event has occurred to the collateral (e.g. tentative map has been filed), or if we believe foreclosure is imminent. Impaired loan balances increased from $920,000 at December 31, 2018 to $1,103,000 at December 31, 2019. The specific allowance totaled $680,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, as we charge off substantially all of our estimated losses related to specifically identified impaired loans as the losses are identified.\nThe second component, the allowance factor, is an estimate of the probable inherent losses in each loan pool stratified by major categories or loans with similar characteristics in our loan portfolio. This analysis encompasses segmenting and reviewing historical losses, loan grades by pool and current general economic and business conditions. Confirmation of the quality of our grading process is obtained by independent reviews conducted by consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by various bank regulatory agencies. This analysis covers our entire loan portfolio but excludes any loans that were analyzed individually for specific allowances as discussed above. There are limitations to any credit risk grading process. The number of loans makes it impractical to review every loan every quarter. Therefore, it is possible that in the future, some currently performing loans not recently graded will not be as strong as their last grading and an insufficient portion of the allowance will have been allocated to them. Grading and loan review often must be done without knowing whether all relevant facts are at hand. Troubled borrowers may deliberately or inadvertently omit important information from reports or conversations with lending officers regarding their financial condition and the diminished strength of repayment sources.\nThe total amount allocated for the second component is determined by applying loss estimation factors based on loss history to outstanding loans. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the allowance allocated by categories of credits totaled $5.3 million and $5.1 million, respectively.\nThe third component of the allowance for loan losses is an economic and qualitative component that is intended to absorb losses caused by portfolio trends, concentration of credit, growth, and economic trends, as stated previously in \"Critical Accounting Policies\". At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the general valuation allowance, including the economic component, totaled $3.1 million and $3.0 million, respectively. While published economic data indicates that the current economic recovery cycle is approaching 10 years, which would be the longest in U.S history, it is uncertain that the recovery cycle will continue for any definite period of time. In response to this, we have been proactive in evaluating reserve percentages for economic and other qualitative loss factors used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The increase to the third component of the allowance for loan losses reflected such evaluation.\nThe table below summarizes, for the periods indicated, loan balances at the end of each period, the daily averages during the period, changes in the allowance for loan losses arising from loans charged off, recoveries on loans previously charged off, additions to the allowance and certain ratios related to the allowance for loan losses:\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td>

Assets\nFor various business purposes, we make investments in earning assets other than the interest-earning securities and loans discussed above. The primary other earning assets held by the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, includes the cash surrender value of the Bank Owned Life Insurance ( BOLI\u201d) policies, Federal Home Loan Bank stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock. During 2019, we purchased 4 new life insurance policies on certain directors and employees for a total investment of $5 million. During 2018, we committed to invest $5 million in a new low-income housing tax credit fund ( LIHTC\u201d) to promote our participation in CRA activities, which had an unfunded commitment of $2,998,000 as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we held another LIHTC investment that we've participated in since 2006, for which the original investment was $1 million, and there were no unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. For both LIHTC investments, we receive the return in the form of tax credits and tax deductions over a period of approximately 15 years. In 2017, we made a $1 million commitment as a limited partner, to a small business private equity partnership to promote our participation in CRA activities. Returns will be received in the form of dividends from the general partner. As of December 31, 2019, we have remaining commitments to fund an additional $520,000 on this investment.\nThe balances of other earning assets as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were as follows:\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BOLI\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,028 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> LIHTCs\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,640 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,076 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Small business private equity partnership\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>400 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal Reserve Bank Stock\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>758 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal Home Loan Bank Stock\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,599 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeposits and Other Sources of Funds\nDeposits\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $1,019,929 and $986,495,000, respectively, representing an increase of $33,434,000 or 3.4% in 2019. The average deposits for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $3,536,000 or 0.4% to $964,444,000 compared to $967,980,000 at December 31, 2018.\nDeposits are the Company's primary source of funds. Due to strategic emphasis by management, core deposits (based on definition provided by FDIC's Uniform Bank Performance Report) increased by $33.5 million or 3.3% in 2019 to $1.00 billion at December 31, 2019. The percentage of core deposits to total deposits increased slightly to 98.2% at December 31, 2019 as compared to 98.1% at December 31, 2018. The average rate paid on time deposits in denominations of over $250,000 was 0.47% and 0.36% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The composition and cost of the Company's deposit base are important components in analyzing the Company's net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics, both of which are discussed in greater detail in other sections herein. See Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\u201d for further discussion.\nThe Company's liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments or, in other words, by the propensity of that money to leave the institution for rate-related or other reasons. Deposits can be adversely affected if economic conditions in California and the Company's market area in particular, continue to weaken. Potentially, the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are jumbo certificates of deposit, meaning time deposits with balances that equal or exceed $250,000, as customers with balances of that magnitude are typically more rate-sensitive than customers with smaller balances.\nThe following tables summarize the distribution of average daily deposits and the average daily rates paid for the periods indicated:\nDistribution of Average Daily Deposits\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in Thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Demand\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>610,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>559,639 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Money market\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>232,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>288,454 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Savings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.06 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits $250,000 and under\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits over $250,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.47 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.36 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>964,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>967,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe scheduled maturities of our time deposits in denominations of more than $250,000 at December 31, 2019 are, as follows:\nMaturities of Time Deposits over $250,000\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> Three months or less\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,311 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over three months through six months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,270 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over six months through twelve months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,217 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over twelve months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,344 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,142 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause our client base is comprised primarily of commercial and industrial accounts, individual account balances are generally higher than those of consumer-oriented banks. Four of our clients carry deposit balances of more than 1% of our total deposits, none of which had a deposit balance of more than 3% of total deposits at December 31, 2019. The Company had no brokered deposits as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nFHLB Borrowings\nAlthough deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for general business purposes, we may obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco ( FHLB\u201d) as an alternative to retail deposit funds. We had no outstanding balances as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 or at any time during 2019 and 2018. See Liquidity Management\u201d below for the details on the FHLB borrowings program.\nReturn on Equity and Assets\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding our return on equity and assets for the periods indicated:\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.15 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.08 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average common equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.78 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.26 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividend payout ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.53 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.31 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity to assets ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.81 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.05 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeferred Compensation Obligations\nWe maintain a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan for certain key management personnel. Under this plan, participating employees may defer compensation, which will entitle them to receive certain payments upon retirement, death, or disability. The plan provides for payments commencing upon retirement and reduced benefits upon early retirement, disability, or termination of employment. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our aggregate payment obligations under this plan totaled $9.9 million and $8.0 million, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the ordinary course of business, we provide various forms of credit lines to meet the financing needs of our customers. These commitments, which represent a credit risk to us, are not represented in any form on our balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2019, and 2018, we had commitments to extend credit of $164.7 million and $153.9 million, respectively. Obligations under standby letters of credit, included in total commitments to extend credit, were $3.1 million and $2.3 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and there were no obligations under commercial letters of credit for either period.\nThe effect on our revenues, expenses, cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used. For more information regarding our off balance sheet arrangements, see Note 13- Commitments and Other Contingencies- to our 2019 year-end consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following chart summarizes certain contractual obligations of the Company as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than 1\nyear\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than 5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,080 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,193 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Supplemental retirement plans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,212 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,978 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposit maturities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,927 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,743 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,501 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,098 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs permitted or required under California law and to the maximum extent allowable under that law, we have certain obligations to indemnify our current and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. These indemnification obligations are valid as long as the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, our best interests, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited; however, we have a director and officer insurance policy that mitigates our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal.\nLiquidity and Asset/Liability Management\nManagement seeks to ascertain optimum and stable utilization of available assets and liabilities as a vehicle to attain our overall business plans and objectives. In this regard, management focuses on measurement and control of liquidity risk, interest rate risk and market risk, capital adequacy, operation risk and credit risk.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity to meet borrowers' credit and depositors' withdrawal demands is provided by maturing assets, short-term liquid assets that can be converted to cash and the ability to attract funds from depositors. Additional sources of liquidity may include institutional deposits, advances from the FHLB and other short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased.\nSince our deposit growth strategy emphasizes core deposit growth, we have avoided relying on brokered deposits as a consistent source of funds. The Company had no brokered deposits as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nAs a secondary source of liquidity, we rely on advances from the FHLB to supplement our supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. Advances from the FHLB are typically secured by a portion of our loan portfolio and stock issued by the FHLB. The FHLB determines limitations on the amounts of advances by assigning a percentage to each eligible loan category that will count towards the borrowing capacity. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no FHLB advances outstanding and had sufficient collateral to borrow an additional $275.2 million and $268.9 million, respectively. In addition, the Company had lines of credit with its correspondent banks to purchase overnight federal funds totaling $30 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. No advances were made on these lines of credit as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe Company's liquidity depends primarily on dividends paid to it as the sole shareholder of the Bank. The Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Company may depend on whether the Bank will be in a position to pay dividends based on regulatory requirements and the performance of the Bank.\nMaintenance of adequate liquidity requires that sufficient resources be available at all time to meet our cash flow requirements. Liquidity in a banking institution is required primarily to provide for deposit withdrawals and the credit needs of its customers and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise. Liquidity management involves our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without incurring significant loss, and to raise cash or maintain funds without incurring excessive additional cost. For this purpose, we maintain a portion of our funds in cash and cash equivalents, loans and securities available for sale. Our liquid assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018 totaled approximately $227.6 million and $238.5 million, respectively. Our liquidity level measured as the percentage of liquid assets to total assets was 19.8% and 21.8% at December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nCapital Resources and Capital Adequacy Requirements\nIn the past two years, our primary source of capital has been internally generated operating income through retained earnings. At December 31, 2019, total shareholders' equity increased to $112.6 million, representing an increase of $13.5 million from December 31, 2018. The increase was due to net income of $12.5 million recorded to retained earnings, and other comprehensive income of $2.8 million, net of income taxes, due to the positive effect that declining treasury yields had on the unrealized market value adjustment of our available for sale investment portfolio during 2019. Also, retained earnings was reduced by the common stock dividend payments totaling $2.2 million during 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures.\nWe are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements and operations. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we must meet specific capital guidelines that rely on the quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. (See Description of Business-Regulation and Supervision-Capital Adequacy Requirements\u201d in this report for exact definitions and regulatory capital requirements.)\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were qualified as a well capitalized institution\u201d under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. The following table presents the regulatory minimums for well-capitalized institutions, compared to the Bank's capital ratios as of the dates specified:\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Regulatory Minimum (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capital to risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>10.5% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>8.5% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common equity tier 1 risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>7.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier I capital to average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>4.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The Regulatory Minimum\u201d thresholds in the table above are reflected on a fully phased-in basis, which occurred in January 2019.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of financial condition as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and results of operations for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2019 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, included in this report. Average balances, including balances used in calculating certain financial ratios, are generally comprised of average daily balances. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully read Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included in this report.\nIntroduction\nOur continued focus on responsible community banking fundamentals and our strong customer relationships have enabled us to increase our market presence through growth in our loan portfolio, which is primarily funded by steady core deposit growth.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.15 billion in total assets, $751 million in total gross loans, and $1.02 billion in total deposits.\nWe believe the following were key indicators of our performance during 2019:\n \u25cf Total assets increased to $1.15 billion at the end of 2019, an increase of 4.8%, from $1.09 billion at the end of 2018. \n \u25cf Total deposits increased to $1.02 billion at the end of 2019, an increase of 3.4%, from $986 million at the end of 2018. \n \u25cf Total net loans increased to $741 million at the end of 2019, an increase of 5.5%, from $702 million at the end of 2018. \n \u25cf Net interest income increased to $41.0 million in 2019, an increase of $2.5 million or 6.4%, compared to $38.6 million in 2018, mainly as a result of growth of our loan and investment portfolios. \n \u25cf Provision for loan losses decreased by $10,000 to $545,000 in 2019, compared to $555,000 in 2018, mainly due to slightly higher loan growth in the prior year, as overall credit quality remains strong. \n \u25cf The ratio of total non-performing loans to total loans increased slightly to 0.15% at December 31, 2019 from 0.13% at December 31, 2018. Management considers the size of the ratio of non-performing assets to total loans to be low and manageable, and reserves have been taken appropriately. \n \u25cf Total noninterest income increased to $5.0 million in 2019, an increase of 7.1%, from $4.7 million in 2018, which is mainly attributable to service charges and debit card fee income generated from our growing deposit base. \n \u25cf Total noninterest expense increased from $27.4 million in 2018 to $28.8 million in 2019, primarily due to one new branch that opened in 2018, two branch relocations in 2018, and increased general operating costs to support our growing loan and deposit portfolios. \n \u25cf Provision from income taxes increased by $390,000 to $4.2 million in 2019, mainly due to the higher pre-tax income, as our effective tax rate was relatively static compared to the prior year. \nThese items, as well as other factors, contributed to the increase in net income for 2019 to $12.5 million from $11.5 million in 2018, which translates into $1.54 per diluted share in 2019 as compared to $1.42 per diluted share in 2018.\nOver the past several years, our network of branches and loan production offices have expanded geographically. We currently maintain seventeen full-service offices. We intend to continue our growth strategy in future years through the opening of additional branches and loan production offices as our needs and resources permit.\n2020 Outlook\nAs we begin our strategic business plan for 2020, we remained focused on relationship-based expansion throughout our market area. We plan to continue to focus on increasing our loan-to-deposit ratio to expand our net interest margin, while attempting to control expenses and credit losses.\nFavorable trends in our economy prompted the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, or FOMC, to increase the target federal funds by 0.25% in 2016, 0.75% in 2017 and 1.00% in 2018, which was followed by a decrease of 0.75% in 2019. The increased market interest rates from 2016 through 2018 had a positive impact on net interest income mainly due to growth of earning assets and the fact that our balance sheet is slightly asset sensitive. In 2019, that trend reversed and we recognized yield compression on our earning assets due to the FOMC rate cuts. We expect this negative impact to continue if there are further interest rate cuts in 2020. The potential compression of net interest income and net interest margin could occur if interest rates remain static or decline, given that our balance sheet is asset sensitive to interest rate changes primarily due to the number of variable rate loans and a high level of interest-earning cash balances. This could in turn result in further decrease on the yield of earning assets compared to the cost of deposits and other funds, which remain at historic lows and cannot reasonably be further reduced.\nGiven our asset sensitive balance sheet, we expect our net interest income to benefit from interest rate increases, but we expect any such benefit to be proportional to the increase in rates. If we experience an increase in our yield on earnings assets, we could then determine to increase the interest rates we pay on our deposit accounts or change our promotional or other interest rates on new deposits in marketing activation programs to attempt to achieve a certain net interest margin. That said, in light of the current economic environment, if the rates increase is modest, it may not be possible to manage the interest margin in this manner, as competitive pressures may dictate that we increase deposit rates at a faster rate than the earning assets increase, thereby offsetting any gains to the net interest margin. The economies and real estate markets in our primary market areas are expected to continue to be significant determinants of the quality of our assets in future periods and, thus, our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nFor 2020, management remains focused on the above challenges and opportunities and other factors affecting the business similar to the factors driving the 2019 results as discussed in this section.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method, although the economics of our transactions would be the same.\nManagement has determined the following accounting policies to be critical:\nAsset Impairment Judgments\nCertain of our assets are carried in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to recognize impairment of such assets. We periodically perform analyses to test for impairment of various assets. In addition to our impairment analyses related to loans, another significant impairment analysis relates to other than temporary declines in the value of our securities.\nLoans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired and are carried at fair value or below. Appraisals are done periodically on impaired loans and if required, an allowance is established based on the fair value of collateral less the cost related to liquidation of the collateral. In some circumstances, an impaired loan may be charged off to bring the carrying value to fair value.\nOther real estate assets ( OREO\u201d) acquired through, or in lieu of, foreclosure, are held-for-sale and are initially recorded at the fair value, less selling costs. Any write-downs to fair value at the time of transfer to OREO are charged to the allowance for loan losses, subsequent to foreclosure. Appraisals or evaluations are then done periodically thereafter, charging any additional write-downs or valuation allowances to the appropriate expense accounts.\nNet realizable value of the underlying collateral is the fair value of the collateral, less estimated selling costs and any prior liens. Appraisals, recent comparable sales, offers and listing prices are factored in when valuing the collateral. We review and verify the qualifications and licenses of the certified general appraisers used for appraising commercial properties or certified residential appraisers for residential properties. Real estate appraisals may utilize a combination of approaches including replacement cost, sales comparison and the income approach. Comparable sales and income data are analyzed by the appraisers and adjusted to reflect differences between them and the subject property such as type, leasing status and physical condition. When the appraisals are received, management reviews the assumptions and methodology utilized in the appraisal, as well as the overall resulting value in conjunction with independent data sources, such as recent market data and industry-wide statistics. We generally use a 6% discount for selling costs which is applied to all properties, regardless of size. Appraised values may be adjusted to reflect changes in market conditions that have occurred subsequent to the appraisal date, or for revised estimates regarding the timing or cost of the property sale. These adjustments are based on qualitative judgments made by management on a case-by-case basis.\nOur available for sale portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity. We conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the value of any security has declined below its carrying value and whether such decline is other than temporary. If such decline is deemed other than temporary, we would adjust the carrying amount of the security by writing down the security to fair value through a charge to current period income for the amount that is determined to be other than temporary . The fair values of our securities are significantly affected by changes in interest rates.\nIn general, as interest rates rise, we expect that the fair value of fixed-rate securities should decrease; as interest rates fall, we expect that the fair value of fixed-rate securities should increase. With significant changes in interest rates, we evaluate our intent and ability to hold the security for a sufficient time to recover the recorded principal balance. Estimated fair values for securities are based on published or securities dealers' market values. Market volatility is unpredictable and may impact such values.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nCredit risk is inherent in the business of lending and making commercial loans. Accounting for our allowance for loan losses involves significant judgment and assumptions by management and is based on historical data and management's view of the current economic environment. At least on a quarterly basis, our management reviews the methodology and adequacy of allowance for loan losses and reports its assessment to the Board of Directors for its review and approval.\nThe allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable incurred losses with regard to our loans. Our loan loss provision for each period is dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loans, delinquencies, management's assessment of the quality of the loans, the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in our market area. We base our allowance for loan losses on an estimation of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio.\nOur methodology for assessing loan loss allowances are intended to reduce the differences between estimated and actual losses and involves a detailed analysis of our loan portfolio, in three phases:\n\u25cf the specific review of individual loans,\n\u25cf the segmenting and review of loan pools with similar characteristics, and\n\u25cf our judgmental estimate based on various subjective factors:\nThe first phase of our methodology involves the specific review of individual loans to identify and measure impairment. We evaluate each loan by use of a risk rating system, except for homogeneous loans, such as automobile loans and home mortgages. Specific risk rated loans are deemed impaired if all amounts, including principal and interest, will likely not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the related loan agreement. Impairment for commercial and real estate loans is measured either based on the present value of the loan's expected future cash flows or, if collection on the loan is collateral dependent, the estimated fair value of the collateral, less selling and holding costs.\nThe second phase involves the segmenting of the remainder of the risk rated loan portfolio into groups or pools of loans, together with loans with similar characteristics, for evaluation. We determine the calculated loss ratio to each loan pool based on its historical net losses and benchmark it against the levels of other peer banks.\nIn the third phase, we consider relevant internal and external factors that may affect the collectability of loan portfolio and each group of loan pool. The factors considered are, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf concentration of credits,\n\u25cf nature and volume of the loan portfolio,\n\u25cf delinquency trends,\n\u25cf non-accrual loan trends,\n\u25cf problem loan trends,\n\u25cf loss and recovery trends,\n\u25cf quality of loan review,\n\u25cf lending and management staff,\n\u25cf lending policies and procedures,\n\u25cf economic and business conditions, and\n\u25cf other external factors.\nOur management estimates the probable effect of such conditions based on our judgment, experience and known or anticipated trends. Such estimation may be reflected as an additional allowance to each group of loans, if necessary. Management reviews these conditions with our senior credit officers. To the extent that any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date, management's estimate of the effect of such condition may be reflected as a specific allowance applicable to such credit or portfolio segment. Where any of these conditions is not evidenced by a specific, identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date, management's evaluation of the inherent loss related to such condition is reflected in the unallocated allowance.\nCentral to our credit risk management and our assessment of appropriate loss allowance is our loan risk rating system. Under this system, the originating credit officer assigns borrowers an initial risk rating based on a thorough analysis of each borrower's financial capacity in conjunction with industry and economic trends. Approvals are made based upon the amount of inherent credit risk specific to the transaction and are reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit administration personnel. Credits are monitored by line and credit administration personnel for deterioration in a borrower's financial condition which may impact the ability of the borrower to perform under the contract. Although management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loans, specific loan pools, and off-balance sheet credit exposures (which are reported separately as part of other liabilities), the adequacy of the allowance is considered in its entirety.\nIt is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate for risks inherent in the overall loan portfolio, however, the loan portfolio can be adversely affected if the state of California's economic conditions and its real estate market in our general market area were to further deteriorate or weaken. Additionally, further weakness of a prolonged nature in the agricultural and general economy would have a negative impact on the local market. The effect of such economic events, although uncertain and unpredictable at this time, could result in an increase in the levels of nonperforming loans and additional loan losses, which could adversely affect our future growth and profitability. No assurance of the level of predicted credit losses can be given with any certainty.\nNon-Accrual Loan Policy\nInterest on loans is credited to income as earned and is accrued only if deemed collectible. Accrual of interest is discontinued when a loan is over 90 days delinquent or if management believes that collection is highly uncertain. Generally, payments received on nonaccrual loans are recorded as principal reductions. Interest income is recognized after all principal has been repaid or an improvement in the condition of the loan has occurred that would warrant resumption of interest accruals.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled using the liability method. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and the state of California. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal or state/local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2015.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. We base our fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Securities available for sale, derivatives, and loans held for sale, if any, are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to record certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis, such as certain impaired loans held for investment and securities held to maturity that are other-than-temporarily impaired. These non-recurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of individual assets due to application of lower-of-cost or market accounting.\nWe have established and documented a process for determining fair value. We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements. Whenever there is no readily available market data, management uses its best estimate and assumptions in determining fair value, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, our recorded earnings or disclosures could have been materially different from those reflected in these financial statements. For detailed information on our use of fair value measurements and our related valuation methodologies, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU is a converged standard involving FASB and International Financial Reporting Standards that provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers across transactions and industries. The core principal of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to reflect the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount and at a time that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Subsequent updates related to Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) are as follows:\n \u25cf August 2015 ASU No. 2015-14 - Deferral of the Effective Date, institutes a one-year deferral of the effective date of this amendment to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. \n \u25cf March 2016 ASU No. 2016-08 - Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and on the use of indicators that assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer. \n \u25cf April 2016 ASU No. 2016-10 - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, provides guidance in determining performance obligations in a contract with a customer and clarifies whether a promise to grant a license provides a right to access or the right to use intellectual property. \n \u25cf May 2016 ASU No. 2016-12 - Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, gives further guidance on assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. \nTopic 606 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2018 and did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. No additional disaggregated revenue disclosures are necessary because interest income sources are scoped out and there are no additional significant non-interest income sources to break out on the consolidated statements of income.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The amendments in this ASU make improvements to GAAP related to financial instruments that include the following as applicable to us.\n \u25cf Equity investments, except for those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee, are required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. \n \u25cf Simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment - if impairment exists, this requires measuring the investment at fair value. \n \u25cf Eliminates the requirement for public companies to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is currently required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. \n \u25cf Public companies will be required to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. \n \u25cf Requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. \n \u25cf The reporting entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity's other deferred tax assets. \nASU 2016-01 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. This ASU was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2018 and impacted the Company's consolidated financial statement disclosures but did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This ASU was issued to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities, including leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP, on the balance sheet and requiring additional disclosures of key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and was adopted under the current period adjustment method, which allows for prior period accumulated amounts to be recorded as of the effective date. The Company adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2019 and determined that the gross-up of its balance sheet from recording a right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) asset and a lease liability for each lease as a result of adopting this ASU, did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated financial statements. See Note 13 for further discussion of the Company's leases and the impact of this ASU.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). This update changes the methodology used by financial institutions under current U.S. GAAP to recognize credit losses in the financial statements. Currently, U.S. GAAP requires the use of the incurred loss model, whereby financial institutions recognize in current period earnings, incurred credit losses and those inherent in the financial statements, as of the date of the balance sheet. This guidance results in a new model for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses, commonly referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss ( CECL\u201d) model. Under the CECL model, financial institutions are required to estimate future credit losses and recognize those losses in current period earnings. The amendments within the update are effective for fiscal years and all interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. In October 2019, FASB approved an amendment that will delay the adoption of this ASU for three years for certain entities including the Company since we are classified as a Small Reporting Company. Upon adoption of the amendments within this update on January 1, 2023, the Company will be required to make a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this update will have on its financial statements. While the Company has not quantified the impact of this ASU, it does expect changing from the current incurred loss model to an expected loss model should result in an earlier recognition of losses.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Subtopic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The provisions of the update eliminate the existing second step of the goodwill impairment test which provides for the allocation of reporting unit fair value among existing assets and liabilities, with the net leftover amount representing the implied fair value of goodwill. In replacement of the existing goodwill impairment rule, the update will provide that impairment should be recognized as the excess of any of the reporting unit's goodwill over the fair value of the reporting unit. Under the provisions of this update, the amount of the impairment is limited to the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill. For public business entities that are SEC filers, the amendments of the update will become effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We do not expect that the ASU will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The ASU was issued to address certain stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The ASU provides companies with the option to reclassify stranded tax effects within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings in each period in which the effect of the change from the newly enacted corporate tax rate is recorded. The amount of the reclassification would be calculated on the basis of the difference between the historical and newly enacted tax rates for deferred tax liabilities and assets related to items within accumulated other comprehensive income. The ASU requires companies to disclose its accounting policy related to releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income, whether it has elected to reclassify the stranded tax effects, and information about the other income tax effects that are reclassified. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods, therein, and early adoption is permitted for public business entities for which financial statements have not yet been issued. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the ASU and made a reclassification adjustment of $163,000 from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings on the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity, related to the stranded tax effects due to the change in the federal corporate tax rate applied on the unrealized gains (losses) on investments on a portfolio basis, to reflect the provisions of this ASU.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Subtopic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The primary focus of ASU 2018-13 is to improve the effectiveness of the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The changes affect all companies that are required to include fair value measurement disclosures. In general, the amendments in ASU 2018-13 are effective for all entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. An entity is permitted to early adopt the removed or modified disclosures upon the issuance of ASU 2018-13 and may delay adoption of the additional disclosures, which are required for public companies only, until their effective date. The guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842): Codification Improvements. This ASU addresses two lessor implementation issues and clarifies that lessees and lessors are exempt from certain interim disclosure requirements associated with adopting ASU 2016-02. The amendments related to the lessor implementation issues are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. As the ASU's amendments applicable to us only relate to disclosures, the adoption of ASU 2019-01 will not impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments that clarifies and improves areas of guidance related to recently issued standards on credit losses, hedging and recognition and measurement. The provisions of this ASU are effective January 1, 2020 and contain various methods of adoption. We do not expect that the ASU will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief. This ASU allows an option for entities to irrevocably elect the fair value option on an instrument-by-instrument basis for eligible financial assets measured at amortized cost basis upon adoption of the credit loss standards. This amendment provides relief for those entities electing the fair value option on newly originated or purchased financial assets, while maintaining existing similar financial assets at amortized cost, avoiding the requirement to maintain dual measurement methods for similar assets. The fair value option does not apply to held-to-maturity debt securities. The effective date for this ASU is the same as for ASU 2016-13, as discussed above. We will evaluate this ASU in conjunction with ASU 2016-13 to determine its impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nResults of Operations\nThe Company earns income from two primary sources. The first is net interest income, which is interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. The second is noninterest income, which primarily consists of deposit service charges and fees, the increase in cash surrender value of life insurance, investment advisory service fee income and mortgage commissions. The majority of the Company's noninterest expenses are operating costs that relate to providing a full range of banking services to our customers.\nOverview\nWe recorded net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $12,489,000 or $1.54 per diluted share compared to $11,537,000 or $1.42 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase of $2,466,000 in net interest income, mainly from the growth of our loan and investment portfolios. Non-interest income increased by $335,000 in 2019, mainly as a result of increase service charges and debit card fee income. The provision for loan losses decreased by $10,000 in 2019 due to lower loan growth. Non-interest expense increased by $1,469,000 associated with two branch relocations and one de novo branch opened in 2018, in addition to general operating overhead increases to support the growth of our loan and deposit portfolios.\nHighlights of the financial results are presented in the following table:\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of and for the years ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> For the period:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income available to common shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,094 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income per common share:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average common equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.78 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.26 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.41 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.15 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.08 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.91 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common stock dividend payout ratio of earnings during the period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.53 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.31 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.23 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Efficiency ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.95 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61.37 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.66 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> At period end:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Book value per common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.09 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11.21 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,147,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,094,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,034,852 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>750,985 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>711,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>662,544 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,019,929 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>986,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>938,882 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loan-to-deposit ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72.66 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.18 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69.55 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nOur primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between interest and fees derived from earning assets and interest paid on liabilities obtained to fund those assets. Our net interest income is affected by changes in the level and mix of interest-earning assets and interest- bearing liabilities, referred to as volume changes. Our net interest income is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities, referred to as rate changes. Interest rates charged on our loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans, the supply of money available for lending purposes and competitive factors. Those factors are, in turn, affected by general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control, such as federal economic policies, the general supply of money in the economy, legislative tax policies, governmental budgetary matters, and the actions of the Federal Reserve Board.\nFor a detailed analysis of interest income and interest expense, see the Average Balance Sheets\u201d and the

(1) Loan fees have been included in the calculation of interest income. \n (2) Yields on municipal securities and loans have been adjusted to their fully-taxable equivalents (FTE), based on a federal marginal tax rate of 21.0%. \n (3) Represents the average rate earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. \n (4) Represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. \nNet interest income, on a fully tax equivalent basis ( FTE\u201d), increased $2,457,000 or 6.3% to $41,708,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $39,251,000 in 2018. Net interest spread and net interest margin were 4.03% and 4.13%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 3.80% and 3.89%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018. This upward trend is mainly due to the increase in earning asset yield as described below and a change in mix of earning assets with higher loan balances and lower cash balances.\nOur earning asset yield increased 24 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018. The yield on loans recognized an increase of 4 basis points for 2019 compared to 2018, which was primarily due to loan repricing of variable rate loans, higher rate indexes on new loans and an increase in loan fees. The FOMC cut rates three times in 2019 with the first one in August, so rates remained at higher levels for the majority of 2019, as compared to 2018. The increase in loan yield was complemented by growth in the loan portfolio average balance of $59,359,000 in 2019 as compared to 2018. During the same period, average cash balances decreased by $56,139,000, representing a shift in the earning asset mix from low-yielding cash balances to higher yielding loan balances. Lastly, as was the case for all earning assets, the FOMC interest rate hikes in 2017 and 2018 had a positive impact to our cash balances in particular, as evidenced by the increase of 17 basis points during 2019 compared to 2018.\nThe cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities increased slightly to 0.26% in 2019 compared to 0.25% in 2018 as our excess liquidity has allowed us to keep deposit rates low on a relative basis. Average non-interest-bearing demand deposit balances increased by $38,303,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, which contributed in maintaining our low cost of funds.\nIn spite of the interest margin expansion the Company has recognized over recent years, there are certain factors that have limited net interest margin expansion and could possibly result in in net interest margin compression if rates were to fall, which include: 1) deposit interest rates remain at historic lows from which they cannot reasonably be further reduced, 2) competition in the lending market restrict significant increases in new loan rates, and 3) deposit growth has out-paced loan growth in recent years resulting in higher interest-bearing cash balances, which yielded approximately 2.09% on average during 2019.\nChanges in volume resulted in an increase in net interest income (on a FTE basis) of $1,994,000 for the year of 2019 compared to the year 2018, and changes in interest rates and the mix resulted in an increase in net interest income (on a FTE basis) of $463,000 for the year 2019 versus the year 2018. Management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin.\nMarket rates are in part based on the FOMC target Federal funds interest rate (the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term borrowings). The change in the Federal funds sold rates is the result of target rate changes implemented by the FOMC. In 2008, there were seven downward adjustments to the target rate totaling 325 basis points, bringing the target interest rate to a historic low with a range of 0% to 0.25% where it remained until December 2015 when the FOMC increased by 0.25% to a range of 0.25% to 0.50%. The FOMC increased the Federal funds rate again in December 2016 by 0.25% to a range of 0.50% to 0.75%. In 2017, the FOMC increased the Federal funds rate by 0.25% on three occasions resulting in a range of 1.25% to 1.50% as of December 31, 2017. In 2018, the FOMC increased the Federal funds rate by 0.25% on four occasions resulting in a range of 2.25% to 2.50% as of December 31, 2018. In 2019, the FOMC decreased the Federal funds rate by 0.25% on three occasions resulting in a range of 1.50% to 1.75% as of December 31, 2019.\nRate/Volume Analysis\nThe following table below sets forth certain information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense of the Company for the periods indicated. For each category of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (change in average volume multiplied by old rate); and (ii) changes in rates (change in rate multiplied by old average volume). Changes in rate/volume (change in rate multiplied by the change in volume) have been allocated to the changes due to volume and rate in proportion to the absolute value of the changes due to volume and rate prior to the allocation.\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Rate/Volume Analysis of Net Interest Income\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Losses\nCredit risk is inherent in the business of making loans. The Company establishes an allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings, which are shown in the consolidated statements of income as the provision for loan losses. Specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are promptly charged off against the allowance. The Company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that it considers to be adequate to provide for credit losses inherent in its loan portfolio. Management determines the level of the allowance by performing a quarterly analysis that considers concentrations of credit, past loss experience, current economic conditions, the amount and composition of the loan portfolio (including nonperforming and potential problem loans), estimated fair value of underlying collateral, and other information relevant to assessing the risk of loss inherent in the loan portfolio such as loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, and delinquencies. As a result of management's analysis, a range of the potential amount of the allowance for loan losses is determined.\nThe Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $545,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019 mainly to provide an adequate loan loss reserve for the new loan funding, as compared to provisions of $555,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Nonperforming loans were $1,103,000 at December 31, 2019 and $920,000 at December 31, 2018, or 0.15% and 0.13%, respectively, of total loans. Nonperforming loans are primarily in nonperforming real estate construction and development loans. The allowance for loan losses was $9,146,000 and $8,685,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, or 1.22% of total loans for each period. The strong credit quality has resulted in relatively low net charge-off totals of $84,000 in 2019 and $36,000 in 2018.\nThe Company will continue to monitor the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and make additions to the allowance in accordance with the analysis referred to above. Because of uncertainties inherent in estimating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, actual results may differ from management's estimate of credit losses and the related allowance.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table sets forth a summary of noninterest income for the periods indicated:\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Amount)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Amount)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(%) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges on deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,619 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debit card transaction fee income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings on cash surrender value of life insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>602 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage commissions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gains on sales and calls of securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of other real estate owned\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,084,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,067,483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest income as a % of average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest income was $5,047,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $4,712,000 for the year 2018. Service charge income and debit card transaction fee income increased to $1,619,000 and $1,297,000, respectively, for the year 2019 compared to $1,549,000 and $1,185,000 for the year 2018, as a result of the increase in the aggregate number of transaction deposit accounts and corresponding service fee income. Earnings on the cash surrender value of life insurance recognized an increase of $91,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, due to four new life insurance policies that began earning revenue in July of 2018. Mortgage commissions have decreased by $22,000 for the year 2019, as compared to 2018, as a result of the decreased demand for home purchases and refinancing. Gains on called and sold securities increased from $81,000 in 2018 to $138,000 in 2019, mainly from one security that was called during the first quarter of 2019. There was one sale of an OREO property in 2018, which resulted in a gain of $193,000 for 2018 as compared to no sales or corresponding gains in 2019. In 2019, other income increased by $220,000, which was attributable to an unrealized gain on equity securities of $101,000 in 2019, as compared to an unrealized loss of $90,000 in 2018. The Company continues to evaluate its deposit product offerings with the intention of continuing to expand its offerings to the consumer and business depositors.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table sets forth a summary of noninterest expenses for the periods indicated:\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Amount)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (Amount)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(%) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data processing fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,907 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,707 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Regulatory assessments (FDIC & DBO)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,777 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,313 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,084,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,067,483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest expenses as a % of average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest expense was $28,847,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1,469,000 or 5.4% compared to $27,378,000 for the year ended 2018. Salaries and employee benefits increased by $1,113,000 in 2019 to $17,400,000 compared to the prior year. To support loan and deposit growth, we increased our full-time equivalent staff by five as of December 31, 2019 compared to last year, which combined with the Sacramento branch staffing expense, resulted in increased salary expense and group medical insurance benefits. The Sacramento branch opened its doors in September 2018, and therefore we recognized higher operating expenses in 2019 as the branch was in operation for the full year compared to only four months in 2018.\nOccupancy expense realized a decrease of $138,000 in 2019 compared to the prior year, primarily from rent and other overhead expenses. The 2018 total includes a non-recurring charge of $85,000 for the remaining lease obligation on our vacated Turlock branch, which was relocated during the second quarter of 2018. In addition, depreciation expense on fixed assets decreased by $96,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, due to certain assets that became fully depreciated.\nData processing costs increased in 2019 over 2018 by $200,000, primarily due to servicing costs on the growing number of loan and deposit accounts.\nFDIC and DBO regulatory assessments decreased by $170,000 to $270,000 in 2019 compared to $440,000 in 2018. In January 2019, the FDIC sent notification that small banks less than $10 billion would receive assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%, to be applied when the reserve ratio reached 1.38%. That threshold has since been met and therefore the Company did not recognize any expense for FDIC assessments during the third quarter of 2019. Additionally, the initial base assessment rate for financial institutions varies based on the overall risk profile of the institution as defined by the FDIC and our risk profile was stable during 2018 and 2019, with a slight improvement for both years in asset quality metrics that are included in the risk profile. The result was a reduction in our assessment rate in 2019; however, we expect this should be offset by deposit growth in 2020. The decrease to our recorded expense in 2019 was despite the higher deposit balances in 2019, as the FDIC assessment rates are applied to average quarterly total liabilities as the primary basis. Management is also aware of the potential for further assessment credits to be recognized in future periods if the FDIC reserve ratio remains above 1.38%.\nOther operating expenses increased by $464,000 or 8.7% to $5,777,000 in 2019, primarily as a result of various general operating expense increases required to support our growing business portfolios and compliance mandates, some of which included telephone and data communications, software license fees, provision for losses on undisbursed loan commitments, audit expenses and director expenses.\nManagement anticipates that noninterest expense should continue to increase as we continue to grow, and management believes the Company's administration as currently set up is scalable to handle future deposit growth. However, management remains committed to cost-control and efficiency, and we expect to keep these increases to a minimum relative to growth.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe reported a provision for income taxes of $4,200,000 and $3,810,000 for the years 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 25.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 24.8% for the year 2018. These provisions reflect accruals for taxes at the applicable rates for federal income tax and California franchise tax based upon reported pre-tax income and adjusted for the effects of all permanent differences between income for tax and financial reporting purposes (such as earnings on qualified municipal securities, BOLI and certain tax-exempt loans).\nFinancial Condition\nThe Company's total assets were $1,147,785,000 at December 31, 2019 compared to $1,094,887,000 at December 31, 2018, an increase of $52,898,000 or 4.8%. Net loans increased $38,827,000, investments decreased $16,433,000, bank premises and equipment increased $292,000, interest receivable and other assets increased $3,265,000, while cash and cash equivalents increased $21,449,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018.\nLoans gross of the allowance for loan losses and deferred fees were $750,985,000 at December 31, 2019, compared to $711,902,000 at December 31, 2018, an increase of $39,083,000 or 5.5%. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $52,483,000 or 9.5% in commercial real estate loans, a decrease of $4,548,000 or 5.5% in commercial and industrial loans, an increase of $866,000 or 2.3% in consumer loans and consumer residential loans and a decrease of $9,718,000 or 25.5% in agriculture loans. The composition of the loan portfolio categories remained relatively unchanged as a percentage of total loans, with commercial real estate comprising 81% and 78% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nDeposits increased $33,434,000 or 3.4% to $1,019,929,000 at December 31, 2019 compared to $986,495,000 at December 31, 2018. Money Market and Time Deposits decreased by $39,240,000 and $3,385,000, respectively, while Demand and Savings increased by $70,185,000 and $5,874,000, respectively, as of December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018.\nThere were no short-term borrowing or long-term debt outstanding balances at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Company uses short-term borrowings, primarily short-term FHLB advances, to fund short-term liquidity needs and manage net interest margin.\nEquity increased $13,532,000 or 13.7% to $112,570,000 at December 31, 2019, compared to $99,038,000 at December 31, 2018.\nInvestment Activities\nInvestments are a key source of interest income. Management of our investment portfolio is set in accordance with strategies developed and overseen by our Investment Committee. Investment balances, including cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, are subject to change over time based on our asset/liability funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives. Our liquidity levels take into consideration anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of credits and are maintained at levels management believes are appropriate to assure future flexibility in meeting anticipated funding needs.\nCash Equivalents and Interest-bearing Deposits in other Financial Institutions\nThe Company holds federal funds sold, unpledged available-for-sale securities and salable government guaranteed loans to help meet liquidity requirements and provide temporary holdings until the funds can be otherwise deployed or invested. As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, we had $13,785,000 and $9,720,000, respectively, in federal funds sold.\nInvestment Securities\nManagement of our investment securities portfolio focuses on providing an adequate level of liquidity and establishing an interest rate-sensitive position, while earning an adequate level of investment income without taking undue risk. Investment securities that we intend to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity securities, and all other investment securities are classified as either available-for-sale or equity securities. Currently, all of our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale, except for one mutual fund classified as an equity security.\nThe fair value of the equity security was $3,297,000 and $3,106,000 at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Consistent with ASU 2016-01, equity securities are carried at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of income. Accordingly, the Company recognized an unrealized gain of $101,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to an unrealized loss of $90,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOur available for sale investment securities holdings decreased by $16,624,000 or 8.0%, to $190,088,000 at December 31, 2019, compared to holdings of $206,712,000 at December 31, 2018.

At December 31, 2019, three U.S. agencies, eight asset backed securities, two SBA pools and two corporate debts make up the total debt securities in a loss position for less than 12 months. Management periodically evaluates each available-for-sale investment security in an unrealized loss position to determine if the impairment is temporary or other than temporary. This evaluation encompasses various factors including, the nature of the investment, the cause of the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, credit ratings and other credit related factors such as third party guarantees and the volatility of the security's fair value. Management has determined that no investment security is other than temporarily impaired. The unrealized losses are due primarily to interest rate changes and the Company does not intend to sell the securities and it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the earlier of the forecasted recovery or the maturity of the underlying investment security. As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any investment securities that constituted 10% or more of the stockholders' equity of any third-party issuer.\nThe following table summarizes the maturity and

intervals of the outstanding loans in our portfolio, as of December 31, 2019. In addition, the table shows the distribution of such loans between those with variable or floating interest rates and those with fixed or predetermined interest rates. The large majority of the variable rate loans are tied to independent indices (such as the Wall Street Journal prime rate or a Treasury Constant Maturity Rate). Substantially all loans with an original term of more than five years have provisions for the fixed rates to reset, or convert to a variable rate, after one, three or five years and are therefore classified as a variable rate loan in the table below.\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Loan Maturities and Repricing Schedule\n\t\t\tAt December 31, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In Thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Within\n\t\t\tOne Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After One But\nWithin\n\t\t\tFive Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After\n\t\t\tFive Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>324,926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>177,909 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>607,002 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and industrial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,098 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,704 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,274 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,647 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agriculture\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,974 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,358 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred loan fees and costs, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(172 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(387 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(233 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(792 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loans, net of deferred loan fees and costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>162,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>367,055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>220,553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>750,193 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans with variable (floating) interest rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>269,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>490,997 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans with predetermined (fixed) interest rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>97,476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>132,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>259,196 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe majority of the properties taken as collateral are located in Northern California. We employ strict guidelines regarding the use of collateral located in less familiar market areas. Positive trends in Northern California real estate values, the low loan-to-value ratios in our commercial real estate portfolio, and the high percentage of owner-occupied properties further solidify our credit quality position.\nNonperforming Assets\nFinancial institutions generally have a certain level of exposure to credit quality risk and could potentially receive less than a full return of principal and interest if a debtor becomes unable or unwilling to repay. Since loans are the most significant assets of the Company and generate the largest portion of its revenues, the Company's management of credit quality risk is focused primarily on loan quality. Banks have generally suffered their most severe earnings declines due to customers' inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debts and/or downturns in national and regional economies which have brought about declines in overall property values. In addition, certain debt securities that the Company may purchase have the potential of declining in value if the obligor's financial capacity to repay deteriorates.\nNonperforming assets consist of loans on non-accrual status, loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest, loans restructured, where the terms of repayment have been renegotiated resulting in a reduction or deferral of interest or principal and OREO.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days past due, unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection. The past due loans may or may not be adequately collateralized, but collection efforts are continuously pursued. Loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some changes in financial status, causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms, and where we believe the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and repay the loan in full. OREO consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means and which management intends to offer for sale.\nThe Company had nonperforming loans of $1.1 million at December 31, 2019, as compared to $0.9 million at December 31, 2018. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.15% and 0.13% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIn addition, the Company held one OREO property as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, a residential land property that was acquired through foreclosure that was written down to a zero balance because the public utilities have not been obtainable, thereby rendering these land lots unmarketable at this time.\nManagement believes that the reserve provided for nonperforming loans, together with the tangible collateral, were adequate as of December 31, 2019. See Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d below for further discussion. Except as disclosed above, as of December 31, 2019, management was not aware of any material credit problems of borrowers that would cause it to have serious doubts about the ability of a borrower to comply with the present loan payment terms. However, no assurance can be given that credit problems may exist that may not have been brought to the attention of management, or that credit problems may not arise in the future.\nThe following table provides information with respect to the components of our nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Additional interest income of approximately $62,000 and $68,000 would have been recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, if these loans had been paid in accordance with their original terms.\n(2) A restructured loan\u201d is one the terms of which were renegotiated to provide a concession because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nIn anticipation of credit risk inherent in our lending business, we set aside allowances through charges to earnings. Such charges are not only made for the outstanding loan portfolio, but also for off-balance sheet items, such as commitments to extend credits or letters of credit. The charges made for the outstanding loan portfolio are credited to the allowance for loan losses, whereas charges for off-balance sheet items are credited to the reserve for off-balance sheet items, which is presented as a component of other liabilities. The provision for loan losses is discussed in the section entitled Provision for Loan Losses\u201d above.\nThe balance of our allowance for loan losses is management's best estimate of the probable losses inherent in the portfolio. The ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the real estate market, changes in interest rate and economic and political environments.\nIn recent years, the economic recovery has had a positive impact on the financial stability of our borrowers resulting in improvements in credit quality of our loan portfolio which has allowed us to reduce the reserve for loan losses as a percentage of gross loans. In 2019, we have continued to benefit from the improved credit quality but due to loan growth, we recognized an increase of $461,000 in the allowance for loan losses to $9,146,000 at December 31, 2019, as compared with $8,685,000 at December 31, 2018. In 2019, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans stabilized at 1.22% as of December 31, 2019 corresponding to our improved credit quality and loan growth, as compared to 1.22% as of December 31, 2018. Based on the current conditions of the loan portfolio, management believes that the $9,146,000 allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio. No assurance can be given, however, that adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the portfolio.\nDiversification, low loan-to-values, strong credit quality and enhanced credit monitoring contribute to a reduction in the portfolio's overall risk in recent years and help to offset the economic risk. We continue to monitor the impact of the economic environment, and adjustments to the provision for loan loss will be made accordingly. During 2019, the Company recognized net loan charge-offs of $84,000 as compared to $36,000 in 2018.\nManagement reviews these conditions with our senior credit officers. To the extent that any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date, management's estimate of the effect of such condition may be reflected as a specific allowance applicable to such credit or portfolio segment. Where any of these conditions is not evidenced by a specific, identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date, management's evaluation of the inherent loss related to such condition is reflected in the unallocated allowance. Although management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loan categories, the adequacy of the allowance is considered in its entirety.\nOur allowance for loan losses consisted of amounts allocated to three phases of our methodology for assessing loan loss allowances, as follows (see details of methodology for assessing allowance for loan losses in the section entitled Critical Accounting Policies\u201d):\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Phase of Methodology\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specific review of individual loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>680 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Review of portfolio based on loss trends and current economic climate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,051 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Review of portfolio based on inherent risk and other subjective factors\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,954 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,685 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Components of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nAs stated previously in \"Critical Accounting Policies,\" the overall allowance consists of a specific allowance for individually identified impaired loans, an allowance factor for categories of credits with similar characteristics and trends, and an allowance for changing environmental factors.\nThe first component, the specific allowance, results from the analysis of identified problem credits and the evaluation of sources of repayment including collateral, as applicable. Through management's ongoing loan grading process, individual loans are identified that have conditions that indicate the borrower may be unable to pay all amounts due under the contractual terms. These loans are evaluated individually by management and specified allowances for loan losses are established when the discounted cash flows of future payments or collateral value of collateral-dependent loans are lower than the recorded investment in the loan. Generally, with problem credits that are collateral-dependent, we obtain appraisals of the collateral at least annually. We may obtain appraisals more frequently if we believe the collateral value is subject to market volatility, if a specific event has occurred to the collateral (e.g. tentative map has been filed), or if we believe foreclosure is imminent. Impaired loan balances increased from $920,000 at December 31, 2018 to $1,103,000 at December 31, 2019. The specific allowance totaled $680,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, as we charge off substantially all of our estimated losses related to specifically identified impaired loans as the losses are identified.\nThe second component, the allowance factor, is an estimate of the probable inherent losses in each loan pool stratified by major categories or loans with similar characteristics in our loan portfolio. This analysis encompasses segmenting and reviewing historical losses, loan grades by pool and current general economic and business conditions. Confirmation of the quality of our grading process is obtained by independent reviews conducted by consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by various bank regulatory agencies. This analysis covers our entire loan portfolio but excludes any loans that were analyzed individually for specific allowances as discussed above. There are limitations to any credit risk grading process. The number of loans makes it impractical to review every loan every quarter. Therefore, it is possible that in the future, some currently performing loans not recently graded will not be as strong as their last grading and an insufficient portion of the allowance will have been allocated to them. Grading and loan review often must be done without knowing whether all relevant facts are at hand. Troubled borrowers may deliberately or inadvertently omit important information from reports or conversations with lending officers regarding their financial condition and the diminished strength of repayment sources.\nThe total amount allocated for the second component is determined by applying loss estimation factors based on loss history to outstanding loans. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the allowance allocated by categories of credits totaled $5.3 million and $5.1 million, respectively.\nThe third component of the allowance for loan losses is an economic and qualitative component that is intended to absorb losses caused by portfolio trends, concentration of credit, growth, and economic trends, as stated previously in \"Critical Accounting Policies\". At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the general valuation allowance, including the economic component, totaled $3.1 million and $3.0 million, respectively. While published economic data indicates that the current economic recovery cycle is approaching 10 years, which would be the longest in U.S history, it is uncertain that the recovery cycle will continue for any definite period of time. In response to this, we have been proactive in evaluating reserve percentages for economic and other qualitative loss factors used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The increase to the third component of the allowance for loan losses reflected such evaluation.\nThe table below summarizes, for the periods indicated, loan balances at the end of each period, the daily averages during the period, changes in the allowance for loan losses arising from loans charged off, recoveries on loans previously charged off, additions to the allowance and certain ratios related to the allowance for loan losses:\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td>

Assets\nFor various business purposes, we make investments in earning assets other than the interest-earning securities and loans discussed above. The primary other earning assets held by the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, includes the cash surrender value of the Bank Owned Life Insurance ( BOLI\u201d) policies, Federal Home Loan Bank stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock. During 2019, we purchased 4 new life insurance policies on certain directors and employees for a total investment of $5 million. During 2018, we committed to invest $5 million in a new low-income housing tax credit fund ( LIHTC\u201d) to promote our participation in CRA activities, which had an unfunded commitment of $2,998,000 as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we held another LIHTC investment that we've participated in since 2006, for which the original investment was $1 million, and there were no unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. For both LIHTC investments, we receive the return in the form of tax credits and tax deductions over a period of approximately 15 years. In 2017, we made a $1 million commitment as a limited partner, to a small business private equity partnership to promote our participation in CRA activities. Returns will be received in the form of dividends from the general partner. As of December 31, 2019, we have remaining commitments to fund an additional $520,000 on this investment.\nThe balances of other earning assets as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were as follows:\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BOLI\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,028 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> LIHTCs\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,640 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,076 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Small business private equity partnership\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>400 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal Reserve Bank Stock\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>758 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal Home Loan Bank Stock\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,599 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeposits and Other Sources of Funds\nDeposits\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $1,019,929 and $986,495,000, respectively, representing an increase of $33,434,000 or 3.4% in 2019. The average deposits for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $3,536,000 or 0.4% to $964,444,000 compared to $967,980,000 at December 31, 2018.\nDeposits are the Company's primary source of funds. Due to strategic emphasis by management, core deposits (based on definition provided by FDIC's Uniform Bank Performance Report) increased by $33.5 million or 3.3% in 2019 to $1.00 billion at December 31, 2019. The percentage of core deposits to total deposits increased slightly to 98.2% at December 31, 2019 as compared to 98.1% at December 31, 2018. The average rate paid on time deposits in denominations of over $250,000 was 0.47% and 0.36% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The composition and cost of the Company's deposit base are important components in analyzing the Company's net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics, both of which are discussed in greater detail in other sections herein. See Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\u201d for further discussion.\nThe Company's liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments or, in other words, by the propensity of that money to leave the institution for rate-related or other reasons. Deposits can be adversely affected if economic conditions in California and the Company's market area in particular, continue to weaken. Potentially, the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are jumbo certificates of deposit, meaning time deposits with balances that equal or exceed $250,000, as customers with balances of that magnitude are typically more rate-sensitive than customers with smaller balances.\nThe following tables summarize the distribution of average daily deposits and the average daily rates paid for the periods indicated:\nDistribution of Average Daily Deposits\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in Thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Demand\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>610,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>559,639 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Money market\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>232,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>288,454 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Savings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.06 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits $250,000 and under\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits over $250,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.47 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.36 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>964,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>967,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe scheduled maturities of our time deposits in denominations of more than $250,000 at December 31, 2019 are, as follows:\nMaturities of Time Deposits over $250,000\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> Three months or less\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,311 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over three months through six months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,270 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over six months through twelve months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,217 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over twelve months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,344 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,142 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause our client base is comprised primarily of commercial and industrial accounts, individual account balances are generally higher than those of consumer-oriented banks. Four of our clients carry deposit balances of more than 1% of our total deposits, none of which had a deposit balance of more than 3% of total deposits at December 31, 2019. The Company had no brokered deposits as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nFHLB Borrowings\nAlthough deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for general business purposes, we may obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco ( FHLB\u201d) as an alternative to retail deposit funds. We had no outstanding balances as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 or at any time during 2019 and 2018. See Liquidity Management\u201d below for the details on the FHLB borrowings program.\nReturn on Equity and Assets\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding our return on equity and assets for the periods indicated:\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.15 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.08 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average common equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.78 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.26 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividend payout ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.53 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.31 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity to assets ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.81 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.05 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeferred Compensation Obligations\nWe maintain a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan for certain key management personnel. Under this plan, participating employees may defer compensation, which will entitle them to receive certain payments upon retirement, death, or disability. The plan provides for payments commencing upon retirement and reduced benefits upon early retirement, disability, or termination of employment. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our aggregate payment obligations under this plan totaled $9.9 million and $8.0 million, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the ordinary course of business, we provide various forms of credit lines to meet the financing needs of our customers. These commitments, which represent a credit risk to us, are not represented in any form on our balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2019, and 2018, we had commitments to extend credit of $164.7 million and $153.9 million, respectively. Obligations under standby letters of credit, included in total commitments to extend credit, were $3.1 million and $2.3 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and there were no obligations under commercial letters of credit for either period.\nThe effect on our revenues, expenses, cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used. For more information regarding our off balance sheet arrangements, see Note 13- Commitments and Other Contingencies- to our 2019 year-end consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following chart summarizes certain contractual obligations of the Company as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than 1\nyear\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than 5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,080 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,193 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Supplemental retirement plans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,212 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,978 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposit maturities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,927 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,743 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,501 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,098 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs permitted or required under California law and to the maximum extent allowable under that law, we have certain obligations to indemnify our current and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. These indemnification obligations are valid as long as the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, our best interests, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited; however, we have a director and officer insurance policy that mitigates our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal.\nLiquidity and Asset/Liability Management\nManagement seeks to ascertain optimum and stable utilization of available assets and liabilities as a vehicle to attain our overall business plans and objectives. In this regard, management focuses on measurement and control of liquidity risk, interest rate risk and market risk, capital adequacy, operation risk and credit risk.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity to meet borrowers' credit and depositors' withdrawal demands is provided by maturing assets, short-term liquid assets that can be converted to cash and the ability to attract funds from depositors. Additional sources of liquidity may include institutional deposits, advances from the FHLB and other short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased.\nSince our deposit growth strategy emphasizes core deposit growth, we have avoided relying on brokered deposits as a consistent source of funds. The Company had no brokered deposits as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nAs a secondary source of liquidity, we rely on advances from the FHLB to supplement our supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. Advances from the FHLB are typically secured by a portion of our loan portfolio and stock issued by the FHLB. The FHLB determines limitations on the amounts of advances by assigning a percentage to each eligible loan category that will count towards the borrowing capacity. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no FHLB advances outstanding and had sufficient collateral to borrow an additional $275.2 million and $268.9 million, respectively. In addition, the Company had lines of credit with its correspondent banks to purchase overnight federal funds totaling $30 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. No advances were made on these lines of credit as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe Company's liquidity depends primarily on dividends paid to it as the sole shareholder of the Bank. The Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Company may depend on whether the Bank will be in a position to pay dividends based on regulatory requirements and the performance of the Bank.\nMaintenance of adequate liquidity requires that sufficient resources be available at all time to meet our cash flow requirements. Liquidity in a banking institution is required primarily to provide for deposit withdrawals and the credit needs of its customers and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise. Liquidity management involves our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without incurring significant loss, and to raise cash or maintain funds without incurring excessive additional cost. For this purpose, we maintain a portion of our funds in cash and cash equivalents, loans and securities available for sale. Our liquid assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018 totaled approximately $227.6 million and $238.5 million, respectively. Our liquidity level measured as the percentage of liquid assets to total assets was 19.8% and 21.8% at December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nCapital Resources and Capital Adequacy Requirements\nIn the past two years, our primary source of capital has been internally generated operating income through retained earnings. At December 31, 2019, total shareholders' equity increased to $112.6 million, representing an increase of $13.5 million from December 31, 2018. The increase was due to net income of $12.5 million recorded to retained earnings, and other comprehensive income of $2.8 million, net of income taxes, due to the positive effect that declining treasury yields had on the unrealized market value adjustment of our available for sale investment portfolio during 2019. Also, retained earnings was reduced by the common stock dividend payments totaling $2.2 million during 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures.\nWe are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements and operations. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we must meet specific capital guidelines that rely on the quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. (See Description of Business-Regulation and Supervision-Capital Adequacy Requirements\u201d in this report for exact definitions and regulatory capital requirements.)\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were qualified as a well capitalized institution\u201d under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. The following table presents the regulatory minimums for well-capitalized institutions, compared to the Bank's capital ratios as of the dates specified:\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Regulatory Minimum (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capital to risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>10.5% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>8.5% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common equity tier 1 risk-weighted assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>7.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier I capital to average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>4.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The Regulatory Minimum\u201d thresholds in the table above are reflected on a fully phased-in basis, which occurred in January 2019.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of financial condition as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and results of operations for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2019 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, included in this report. Average balances, including balances used in calculating certain financial ratios, are generally comprised of average daily balances. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully read Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included in this report.\nIntroduction\nOur continued focus on responsible community banking fundamentals and our strong customer relationships have enabled us to increase our market presence through growth in our loan portfolio, which is primarily funded by steady core deposit growth.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.15 billion in total assets, $751 million in total gross loans, and $1.02 billion in total deposits.\nWe believe the following were key indicators of our performance during 2019:\n \u25cf Total assets increased to $1.15 billion at the end of 2019, an increase of 4.8%, from $1.09 billion at the end of 2018. \n \u25cf Total deposits increased to $1.02 billion at the end of 2019, an increase of 3.4%, from $986 million at the end of 2018. \n \u25cf Total net loans increased to $741 million at the end of 2019, an increase of 5.5%, from $702 million at the end of 2018. \n \u25cf Net interest income increased to $41.0 million in 2019, an increase of $2.5 million or 6.4%, compared to $38.6 million in 2018, mainly as a result of growth of our loan and investment portfolios. \n \u25cf Provision for loan losses decreased by $10,000 to $545,000 in 2019, compared to $555,000 in 2018, mainly due to slightly higher loan growth in the prior year, as overall credit quality remains strong. \n \u25cf The ratio of total non-performing loans to total loans increased slightly to 0.15% at December 31, 2019 from 0.13% at December 31, 2018. Management considers the size of the ratio of non-performing assets to total loans to be low and manageable, and reserves have been taken appropriately. \n \u25cf Total noninterest income increased to $5.0 million in 2019, an increase of 7.1%, from $4.7 million in 2018, which is mainly attributable to service charges and debit card fee income generated from our growing deposit base. \n \u25cf Total noninterest expense increased from $27.4 million in 2018 to $28.8 million in 2019, primarily due to one new branch that opened in 2018, two branch relocations in 2018, and increased general operating costs to support our growing loan and deposit portfolios. \n \u25cf Provision from income taxes increased by $390,000 to $4.2 million in 2019, mainly due to the higher pre-tax income, as our effective tax rate was relatively static compared to the prior year. \nThese items, as well as other factors, contributed to the increase in net income for 2019 to $12.5 million from $11.5 million in 2018, which translates into $1.54 per diluted share in 2019 as compared to $1.42 per diluted share in 2018.\nOver the past several years, our network of branches and loan production offices have expanded geographically. We currently maintain seventeen full-service offices. We intend to continue our growth strategy in future years through the opening of additional branches and loan production offices as our needs and resources permit.\n2020 Outlook\nAs we begin our strategic business plan for 2020, we remained focused on relationship-based expansion throughout our market area. We plan to continue to focus on increasing our loan-to-deposit ratio to expand our net interest margin, while attempting to control expenses and credit losses.\nFavorable trends in our economy prompted the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, or FOMC, to increase the target federal funds by 0.25% in 2016, 0.75% in 2017 and 1.00% in 2018, which was followed by a decrease of 0.75% in 2019. The increased market interest rates from 2016 through 2018 had a positive impact on net interest income mainly due to growth of earning assets and the fact that our balance sheet is slightly asset sensitive. In 2019, that trend reversed and we recognized yield compression on our earning assets due to the FOMC rate cuts. We expect this negative impact to continue if there are further interest rate cuts in 2020. The potential compression of net interest income and net interest margin could occur if interest rates remain static or decline, given that our balance sheet is asset sensitive to interest rate changes primarily due to the number of variable rate loans and a high level of interest-earning cash balances. This could in turn result in further decrease on the yield of earning assets compared to the cost of deposits and other funds, which remain at historic lows and cannot reasonably be further reduced.\nGiven our asset sensitive balance sheet, we expect our net interest income to benefit from interest rate increases, but we expect any such benefit to be proportional to the increase in rates. If we experience an increase in our yield on earnings assets, we could then determine to increase the interest rates we pay on our deposit accounts or change our promotional or other interest rates on new deposits in marketing activation programs to attempt to achieve a certain net interest margin. That said, in light of the current economic environment, if the rates increase is modest, it may not be possible to manage the interest margin in this manner, as competitive pressures may dictate that we increase deposit rates at a faster rate than the earning assets increase, thereby offsetting any gains to the net interest margin. The economies and real estate markets in our primary market areas are expected to continue to be significant determinants of the quality of our assets in future periods and, thus, our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nFor 2020, management remains focused on the above challenges and opportunities and other factors affecting the business similar to the factors driving the 2019 results as discussed in this section.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method, although the economics of our transactions would be the same.\nManagement has determined the following accounting policies to be critical:\nAsset Impairment Judgments\nCertain of our assets are carried in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to recognize impairment of such assets. We periodically perform analyses to test for impairment of various assets. In addition to our impairment analyses related to loans, another significant impairment analysis relates to other than temporary declines in the value of our securities.\nLoans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired and are carried at fair value or below. Appraisals are done periodically on impaired loans and if required, an allowance is established based on the fair value of collateral less the cost related to liquidation of the collateral. In some circumstances, an impaired loan may be charged off to bring the carrying value to fair value.\nOther real estate assets ( OREO\u201d) acquired through, or in lieu of, foreclosure, are held-for-sale and are initially recorded at the fair value, less selling costs. Any write-downs to fair value at the time of transfer to OREO are charged to the allowance for loan losses, subsequent to foreclosure. Appraisals or evaluations are then done periodically thereafter, charging any additional write-downs or valuation allowances to the appropriate expense accounts.\nNet realizable value of the underlying collateral is the fair value of the collateral, less estimated selling costs and any prior liens. Appraisals, recent comparable sales, offers and listing prices are factored in when valuing the collateral. We review and verify the qualifications and licenses of the certified general appraisers used for appraising commercial properties or certified residential appraisers for residential properties. Real estate appraisals may utilize a combination of approaches including replacement cost, sales comparison and the income approach. Comparable sales and income data are analyzed by the appraisers and adjusted to reflect differences between them and the subject property such as type, leasing status and physical condition. When the appraisals are received, management reviews the assumptions and methodology utilized in the appraisal, as well as the overall resulting value in conjunction with independent data sources, such as recent market data and industry-wide statistics. We generally use a 6% discount for selling costs which is applied to all properties, regardless of size. Appraised values may be adjusted to reflect changes in market conditions that have occurred subsequent to the appraisal date, or for revised estimates regarding the timing or cost of the property sale. These adjustments are based on qualitative judgments made by management on a case-by-case basis.\nOur available for sale portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity. We conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the value of any security has declined below its carrying value and whether such decline is other than temporary. If such decline is deemed other than temporary, we would adjust the carrying amount of the security by writing down the security to fair value through a charge to current period income for the amount that is determined to be other than temporary . The fair values of our securities are significantly affected by changes in interest rates.\nIn general, as interest rates rise, we expect that the fair value of fixed-rate securities should decrease; as interest rates fall, we expect that the fair value of fixed-rate securities should increase. With significant changes in interest rates, we evaluate our intent and ability to hold the security for a sufficient time to recover the recorded principal balance. Estimated fair values for securities are based on published or securities dealers' market values. Market volatility is unpredictable and may impact such values.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nCredit risk is inherent in the business of lending and making commercial loans. Accounting for our allowance for loan losses involves significant judgment and assumptions by management and is based on historical data and management's view of the current economic environment. At least on a quarterly basis, our management reviews the methodology and adequacy of allowance for loan losses and reports its assessment to the Board of Directors for its review and approval.\nThe allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable incurred losses with regard to our loans. Our loan loss provision for each period is dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loans, delinquencies, management's assessment of the quality of the loans, the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in our market area. We base our allowance for loan losses on an estimation of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio.\nOur methodology for assessing loan loss allowances are intended to reduce the differences between estimated and actual losses and involves a detailed analysis of our loan portfolio, in three phases:\n\u25cf the specific review of individual loans,\n\u25cf the segmenting and review of loan pools with similar characteristics, and\n\u25cf our judgmental estimate based on various subjective factors:\nThe first phase of our methodology involves the specific review of individual loans to identify and measure impairment. We evaluate each loan by use of a risk rating system, except for homogeneous loans, such as automobile loans and home mortgages. Specific risk rated loans are deemed impaired if all amounts, including principal and interest, will likely not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the related loan agreement. Impairment for commercial and real estate loans is measured either based on the present value of the loan's expected future cash flows or, if collection on the loan is collateral dependent, the estimated fair value of the collateral, less selling and holding costs.\nThe second phase involves the segmenting of the remainder of the risk rated loan portfolio into groups or pools of loans, together with loans with similar characteristics, for evaluation. We determine the calculated loss ratio to each loan pool based on its historical net losses and benchmark it against the levels of other peer banks.\nIn the third phase, we consider relevant internal and external factors that may affect the collectability of loan portfolio and each group of loan pool. The factors considered are, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf concentration of credits,\n\u25cf nature and volume of the loan portfolio,\n\u25cf delinquency trends,\n\u25cf non-accrual loan trends,\n\u25cf problem loan trends,\n\u25cf loss and recovery trends,\n\u25cf quality of loan review,\n\u25cf lending and management staff,\n\u25cf lending policies and procedures,\n\u25cf economic and business conditions, and\n\u25cf other external factors.\nOur management estimates the probable effect of such conditions based on our judgment, experience and known or anticipated trends. Such estimation may be reflected as an additional allowance to each group of loans, if necessary. Management reviews these conditions with our senior credit officers. To the extent that any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date, management's estimate of the effect of such condition may be reflected as a specific allowance applicable to such credit or portfolio segment. Where any of these conditions is not evidenced by a specific, identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date, management's evaluation of the inherent loss related to such condition is reflected in the unallocated allowance.\nCentral to our credit risk management and our assessment of appropriate loss allowance is our loan risk rating system. Under this system, the originating credit officer assigns borrowers an initial risk rating based on a thorough analysis of each borrower's financial capacity in conjunction with industry and economic trends. Approvals are made based upon the amount of inherent credit risk specific to the transaction and are reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit administration personnel. Credits are monitored by line and credit administration personnel for deterioration in a borrower's financial condition which may impact the ability of the borrower to perform under the contract. Although management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loans, specific loan pools, and off-balance sheet credit exposures (which are reported separately as part of other liabilities), the adequacy of the allowance is considered in its entirety.\nIt is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate for risks inherent in the overall loan portfolio, however, the loan portfolio can be adversely affected if the state of California's economic conditions and its real estate market in our general market area were to further deteriorate or weaken. Additionally, further weakness of a prolonged nature in the agricultural and general economy would have a negative impact on the local market. The effect of such economic events, although uncertain and unpredictable at this time, could result in an increase in the levels of nonperforming loans and additional loan losses, which could adversely affect our future growth and profitability. No assurance of the level of predicted credit losses can be given with any certainty.\nNon-Accrual Loan Policy\nInterest on loans is credited to income as earned and is accrued only if deemed collectible. Accrual of interest is discontinued when a loan is over 90 days delinquent or if management believes that collection is highly uncertain. Generally, payments received on nonaccrual loans are recorded as principal reductions. Interest income is recognized after all principal has been repaid or an improvement in the condition of the loan has occurred that would warrant resumption of interest accruals.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled using the liability method. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and the state of California. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal or state/local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2015.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. We base our fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Securities available for sale, derivatives, and loans held for sale, if any, are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to record certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis, such as certain impaired loans held for investment and securities held to maturity that are other-than-temporarily impaired. These non-recurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of individual assets due to application of lower-of-cost or market accounting.\nWe have established and documented a process for determining fair value. We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements. Whenever there is no readily available market data, management uses its best estimate and assumptions in determining fair value, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, our recorded earnings or disclosures could have been materially different from those reflected in these financial statements. For detailed information on our use of fair value measurements and our related valuation methodologies, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU is a converged standard involving FASB and International Financial Reporting Standards that provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers across transactions and industries. The core principal of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to reflect the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount and at a time that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Subsequent updates related to Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) are as follows:\n \u25cf August 2015 ASU No. 2015-14 - Deferral of the Effective Date, institutes a one-year deferral of the effective date of this amendment to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. \n \u25cf March 2016 ASU No. 2016-08 - Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and on the use of indicators that assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer. \n \u25cf April 2016 ASU No. 2016-10 - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, provides guidance in determining performance obligations in a contract with a customer and clarifies whether a promise to grant a license provides a right to access or the right to use intellectual property. \n \u25cf May 2016 ASU No. 2016-12 - Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, gives further guidance on assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. \nTopic 606 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2018 and did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. No additional disaggregated revenue disclosures are necessary because interest income sources are scoped out and there are no additional significant non-interest income sources to break out on the consolidated statements of income.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The amendments in this ASU make improvements to GAAP related to financial instruments that include the following as applicable to us.\n \u25cf Equity investments, except for those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee, are required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. \n \u25cf Simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment - if impairment exists, this requires measuring the investment at fair value. \n \u25cf Eliminates the requirement for public companies to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is currently required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. \n \u25cf Public companies will be required to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. \n \u25cf Requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. \n \u25cf The reporting entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity's other deferred tax assets. \nASU 2016-01 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. This ASU was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2018 and impacted the Company's consolidated financial statement disclosures but did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This ASU was issued to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities, including leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP, on the balance sheet and requiring additional disclosures of key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and was adopted under the current period adjustment method, which allows for prior period accumulated amounts to be recorded as of the effective date. The Company adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2019 and determined that the gross-up of its balance sheet from recording a right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) asset and a lease liability for each lease as a result of adopting this ASU, did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated financial statements. See Note 13 for further discussion of the Company's leases and the impact of this ASU.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). This update changes the methodology used by financial institutions under current U.S. GAAP to recognize credit losses in the financial statements. Currently, U.S. GAAP requires the use of the incurred loss model, whereby financial institutions recognize in current period earnings, incurred credit losses and those inherent in the financial statements, as of the date of the balance sheet. This guidance results in a new model for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses, commonly referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss ( CECL\u201d) model. Under the CECL model, financial institutions are required to estimate future credit losses and recognize those losses in current period earnings. The amendments within the update are effective for fiscal years and all interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. In October 2019, FASB approved an amendment that will delay the adoption of this ASU for three years for certain entities including the Company since we are classified as a Small Reporting Company. Upon adoption of the amendments within this update on January 1, 2023, the Company will be required to make a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this update will have on its financial statements. While the Company has not quantified the impact of this ASU, it does expect changing from the current incurred loss model to an expected loss model should result in an earlier recognition of losses.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Subtopic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The provisions of the update eliminate the existing second step of the goodwill impairment test which provides for the allocation of reporting unit fair value among existing assets and liabilities, with the net leftover amount representing the implied fair value of goodwill. In replacement of the existing goodwill impairment rule, the update will provide that impairment should be recognized as the excess of any of the reporting unit's goodwill over the fair value of the reporting unit. Under the provisions of this update, the amount of the impairment is limited to the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill. For public business entities that are SEC filers, the amendments of the update will become effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We do not expect that the ASU will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The ASU was issued to address certain stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The ASU provides companies with the option to reclassify stranded tax effects within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings in each period in which the effect of the change from the newly enacted corporate tax rate is recorded. The amount of the reclassification would be calculated on the basis of the difference between the historical and newly enacted tax rates for deferred tax liabilities and assets related to items within accumulated other comprehensive income. The ASU requires companies to disclose its accounting policy related to releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income, whether it has elected to reclassify the stranded tax effects, and information about the other income tax effects that are reclassified. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods, therein, and early adoption is permitted for public business entities for which financial statements have not yet been issued. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the ASU and made a reclassification adjustment of $163,000 from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings on the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity, related to the stranded tax effects due to the change in the federal corporate tax rate applied on the unrealized gains (losses) on investments on a portfolio basis, to reflect the provisions of this ASU.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Subtopic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The primary focus of ASU 2018-13 is to improve the effectiveness of the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The changes affect all companies that are required to include fair value measurement disclosures. In general, the amendments in ASU 2018-13 are effective for all entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. An entity is permitted to early adopt the removed or modified disclosures upon the issuance of ASU 2018-13 and may delay adoption of the additional disclosures, which are required for public companies only, until their effective date. The guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842): Codification Improvements. This ASU addresses two lessor implementation issues and clarifies that lessees and lessors are exempt from certain interim disclosure requirements associated with adopting ASU 2016-02. The amendments related to the lessor implementation issues are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. As the ASU's amendments applicable to us only relate to disclosures, the adoption of ASU 2019-01 will not impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments that clarifies and improves areas of guidance related to recently issued standards on credit losses, hedging and recognition and measurement. The provisions of this ASU are effective January 1, 2020 and contain various methods of adoption. We do not expect that the ASU will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief. This ASU allows an option for entities to irrevocably elect the fair value option on an instrument-by-instrument basis for eligible financial assets measured at amortized cost basis upon adoption of the credit loss standards. This amendment provides relief for those entities electing the fair value option on newly originated or purchased financial assets, while maintaining existing similar financial assets at amortized cost, avoiding the requirement to maintain dual measurement methods for similar assets. The fair value option does not apply to held-to-maturity debt securities. The effective date for this ASU is the same as for ASU 2016-13, as discussed above. We will evaluate this ASU in conjunction with ASU 2016-13 to determine its impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nResults of Operations\nThe Company earns income from two primary sources. The first is net interest income, which is interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. The second is noninterest income, which primarily consists of deposit service charges and fees, the increase in cash surrender value of life insurance, investment advisory service fee income and mortgage commissions. The majority of the Company's noninterest expenses are operating costs that relate to providing a full range of banking services to our customers.\nOverview\nWe recorded net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $12,489,000 or $1.54 per diluted share compared to $11,537,000 or $1.42 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase of $2,466,000 in net interest income, mainly from the growth of our loan and investment portfolios. Non-interest income increased by $335,000 in 2019, mainly as a result of increase service charges and debit card fee income. The provision for loan losses decreased by $10,000 in 2019 due to lower loan growth. Non-interest expense increased by $1,469,000 associated with two branch relocations and one de novo branch opened in 2018, in addition to general operating overhead increases to support the growth of our loan and deposit portfolios.\nHighlights of the financial results are presented in the following table:\n\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nOur primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between interest and fees derived from earning assets and interest paid on liabilities obtained to fund those assets. Our net interest income is affected by changes in the level and mix of interest-earning assets and interest- bearing liabilities, referred to as volume changes. Our net interest income is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities, referred to as rate changes. Interest rates charged on our loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans, the supply of money available for lending purposes and competitive factors. Those factors are, in turn, affected by general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control, such as federal economic policies, the general supply of money in the economy, legislative tax policies, governmental budgetary matters, and the actions of the Federal Reserve Board.\nFor a detailed analysis of interest income and interest expense, see the Average Balance Sheets\u201d and the Rate/Volume Analysis\u201d below.\n\n (1) Loan fees have been included in the calculation of interest income. \n (2) Yields on municipal securities and loans have been adjusted to their fully-taxable equivalents (FTE), based on a federal marginal tax rate of 21.0%. \n (3) Represents the average rate earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. \n (4) Represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. \nNet interest income, on a fully tax equivalent basis ( FTE\u201d), increased $2,457,000 or 6.3% to $41,708,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $39,251,000 in 2018. Net interest spread and net interest margin were 4.03% and 4.13%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 3.80% and 3.89%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018. This upward trend is mainly due to the increase in earning asset yield as described below and a change in mix of earning assets with higher loan balances and lower cash balances.\nOur earning asset yield increased 24 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018. The yield on loans recognized an increase of 4 basis points for 2019 compared to 2018, which was primarily due to loan repricing of variable rate loans, higher rate indexes on new loans and an increase in loan fees. The FOMC cut rates three times in 2019 with the first one in August, so rates remained at higher levels for the majority of 2019, as compared to 2018. The increase in loan yield was complemented by growth in the loan portfolio average balance of $59,359,000 in 2019 as compared to 2018. During the same period, average cash balances decreased by $56,139,000, representing a shift in the earning asset mix from low-yielding cash balances to higher yielding loan balances. Lastly, as was the case for all earning assets, the FOMC interest rate hikes in 2017 and 2018 had a positive impact to our cash balances in particular, as evidenced by the increase of 17 basis points during 2019 compared to 2018.\nThe cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities increased slightly to 0.26% in 2019 compared to 0.25% in 2018 as our excess liquidity has allowed us to keep deposit rates low on a relative basis. Average non-interest-bearing demand deposit balances increased by $38,303,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, which contributed in maintaining our low cost of funds.\nIn spite of the interest margin expansion the Company has recognized over recent years, there are certain factors that have limited net interest margin expansion and could possibly result in in net interest margin compression if rates were to fall, which include: 1) deposit interest rates remain at historic lows from which they cannot reasonably be further reduced, 2) competition in the lending market restrict significant increases in new loan rates, and 3) deposit growth has out-paced loan growth in recent years resulting in higher interest-bearing cash balances, which yielded approximately 2.09% on average during 2019.\nChanges in volume resulted in an increase in net interest income (on a FTE basis) of $1,994,000 for the year of 2019 compared to the year 2018, and changes in interest rates and the mix resulted in an increase in net interest income (on a FTE basis) of $463,000 for the year 2019 versus the year 2018. Management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin.\nMarket rates are in part based on the FOMC target Federal funds interest rate (the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term borrowings). The change in the Federal funds sold rates is the result of target rate changes implemented by the FOMC. In 2008, there were seven downward adjustments to the target rate totaling 325 basis points, bringing the target interest rate to a historic low with a range of 0% to 0.25% where it remained until December 2015 when the FOMC increased by 0.25% to a range of 0.25% to 0.50%. The FOMC increased the Federal funds rate again in December 2016 by 0.25% to a range of 0.50% to 0.75%. In 2017, the FOMC increased the Federal funds rate by 0.25% on three occasions resulting in a range of 1.25% to 1.50% as of December 31, 2017. In 2018, the FOMC increased the Federal funds rate by 0.25% on four occasions resulting in a range of 2.25% to 2.50% as of December 31, 2018. In 2019, the FOMC decreased the Federal funds rate by 0.25% on three occasions resulting in a range of 1.50% to 1.75% as of December 31, 2019.\nRate/Volume Analysis\nThe following table below sets forth certain information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense of the Company for the periods indicated. For each category of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (change in average volume multiplied by old rate); and (ii) changes in rates (change in rate multiplied by old average volume). Changes in rate/volume (change in rate multiplied by the change in volume) have been allocated to the changes due to volume and rate in proportion to the absolute value of the changes due to volume and rate prior to the allocation.\n\n (1) Loan fees have been included in the calculation of interest income. \nProvision for Loan Losses\nCredit risk is inherent in the business of making loans. The Company establishes an allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings, which are shown in the consolidated statements of income as the provision for loan losses. Specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are promptly charged off against the allowance. The Company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that it considers to be adequate to provide for credit losses inherent in its loan portfolio. Management determines the level of the allowance by performing a quarterly analysis that considers concentrations of credit, past loss experience, current economic conditions, the amount and composition of the loan portfolio (including nonperforming and potential problem loans), estimated fair value of underlying collateral, and other information relevant to assessing the risk of loss inherent in the loan portfolio such as loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, and delinquencies. As a result of management's analysis, a range of the potential amount of the allowance for loan losses is determined.\nThe Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $545,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019 mainly to provide an adequate loan loss reserve for the new loan funding, as compared to provisions of $555,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Nonperforming loans were $1,103,000 at December 31, 2019 and $920,000 at December 31, 2018, or 0.15% and 0.13%, respectively, of total loans. Nonperforming loans are primarily in nonperforming real estate construction and development loans. The allowance for loan losses was $9,146,000 and $8,685,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, or 1.22% of total loans for each period. The strong credit quality has resulted in relatively low net charge-off totals of $84,000 in 2019 and $36,000 in 2018.\nThe Company will continue to monitor the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and make additions to the allowance in accordance with the analysis referred to above. Because of uncertainties inherent in estimating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, actual results may differ from management's estimate of credit losses and the related allowance.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table sets forth a summary of noninterest income for the periods indicated:\n\nNoninterest income was $5,047,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $4,712,000 for the year 2018. Service charge income and debit card transaction fee income increased to $1,619,000 and $1,297,000, respectively, for the year 2019 compared to $1,549,000 and $1,185,000 for the year 2018, as a result of the increase in the aggregate number of transaction deposit accounts and corresponding service fee income. Earnings on the cash surrender value of life insurance recognized an increase of $91,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, due to four new life insurance policies that began earning revenue in July of 2018. Mortgage commissions have decreased by $22,000 for the year 2019, as compared to 2018, as a result of the decreased demand for home purchases and refinancing. Gains on called and sold securities increased from $81,000 in 2018 to $138,000 in 2019, mainly from one security that was called during the first quarter of 2019. There was one sale of an OREO property in 2018, which resulted in a gain of $193,000 for 2018 as compared to no sales or corresponding gains in 2019. In 2019, other income increased by $220,000, which was attributable to an unrealized gain on equity securities of $101,000 in 2019, as compared to an unrealized loss of $90,000 in 2018. The Company continues to evaluate its deposit product offerings with the intention of continuing to expand its offerings to the consumer and business depositors.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table sets forth a summary of noninterest expenses for the periods indicated:\n\nNoninterest expense was $28,847,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1,469,000 or 5.4% compared to $27,378,000 for the year ended 2018. Salaries and employee benefits increased by $1,113,000 in 2019 to $17,400,000 compared to the prior year. To support loan and deposit growth, we increased our full-time equivalent staff by five as of December 31, 2019 compared to last year, which combined with the Sacramento branch staffing expense, resulted in increased salary expense and group medical insurance benefits. The Sacramento branch opened its doors in September 2018, and therefore we recognized higher operating expenses in 2019 as the branch was in operation for the full year compared to only four months in 2018.\nOccupancy expense realized a decrease of $138,000 in 2019 compared to the prior year, primarily from rent and other overhead expenses. The 2018 total includes a non-recurring charge of $85,000 for the remaining lease obligation on our vacated Turlock branch, which was relocated during the second quarter of 2018. In addition, depreciation expense on fixed assets decreased by $96,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, due to certain assets that became fully depreciated.\nData processing costs increased in 2019 over 2018 by $200,000, primarily due to servicing costs on the growing number of loan and deposit accounts.\nFDIC and DBO regulatory assessments decreased by $170,000 to $270,000 in 2019 compared to $440,000 in 2018. In January 2019, the FDIC sent notification that small banks less than $10 billion would receive assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%, to be applied when the reserve ratio reached 1.38%. That threshold has since been met and therefore the Company did not recognize any expense for FDIC assessments during the third quarter of 2019. Additionally, the initial base assessment rate for financial institutions varies based on the overall risk profile of the institution as defined by the FDIC and our risk profile was stable during 2018 and 2019, with a slight improvement for both years in asset quality metrics that are included in the risk profile. The result was a reduction in our assessment rate in 2019; however, we expect this should be offset by deposit growth in 2020. The decrease to our recorded expense in 2019 was despite the higher deposit balances in 2019, as the FDIC assessment rates are applied to average quarterly total liabilities as the primary basis. Management is also aware of the potential for further assessment credits to be recognized in future periods if the FDIC reserve ratio remains above 1.38%.\nOther operating expenses increased by $464,000 or 8.7% to $5,777,000 in 2019, primarily as a result of various general operating expense increases required to support our growing business portfolios and compliance mandates, some of which included telephone and data communications, software license fees, provision for losses on undisbursed loan commitments, audit expenses and director expenses.\nManagement anticipates that noninterest expense should continue to increase as we continue to grow, and management believes the Company's administration as currently set up is scalable to handle future deposit growth. However, management remains committed to cost-control and efficiency, and we expect to keep these increases to a minimum relative to growth.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe reported a provision for income taxes of $4,200,000 and $3,810,000 for the years 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 25.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 24.8% for the year 2018. These provisions reflect accruals for taxes at the applicable rates for federal income tax and California franchise tax based upon reported pre-tax income and adjusted for the effects of all permanent differences between income for tax and financial reporting purposes (such as earnings on qualified municipal securities, BOLI and certain tax-exempt loans).\nFinancial Condition\nThe Company's total assets were $1,147,785,000 at December 31, 2019 compared to $1,094,887,000 at December 31, 2018, an increase of $52,898,000 or 4.8%. Net loans increased $38,827,000, investments decreased $16,433,000, bank premises and equipment increased $292,000, interest receivable and other assets increased $3,265,000, while cash and cash equivalents increased $21,449,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018.\nLoans gross of the allowance for loan losses and deferred fees were $750,985,000 at December 31, 2019, compared to $711,902,000 at December 31, 2018, an increase of $39,083,000 or 5.5%. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $52,483,000 or 9.5% in commercial real estate loans, a decrease of $4,548,000 or 5.5% in commercial and industrial loans, an increase of $866,000 or 2.3% in consumer loans and consumer residential loans and a decrease of $9,718,000 or 25.5% in agriculture loans. The composition of the loan portfolio categories remained relatively unchanged as a percentage of total loans, with commercial real estate comprising 81% and 78% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nDeposits increased $33,434,000 or 3.4% to $1,019,929,000 at December 31, 2019 compared to $986,495,000 at December 31, 2018. Money Market and Time Deposits decreased by $39,240,000 and $3,385,000, respectively, while Demand and Savings increased by $70,185,000 and $5,874,000, respectively, as of December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018.\nThere were no short-term borrowing or long-term debt outstanding balances at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Company uses short-term borrowings, primarily short-term FHLB advances, to fund short-term liquidity needs and manage net interest margin.\nEquity increased $13,532,000 or 13.7% to $112,570,000 at December 31, 2019, compared to $99,038,000 at December 31, 2018.\nInvestment Activities\nInvestments are a key source of interest income. Management of our investment portfolio is set in accordance with strategies developed and overseen by our Investment Committee. Investment balances, including cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, are subject to change over time based on our asset/liability funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives. Our liquidity levels take into consideration anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of credits and are maintained at levels management believes are appropriate to assure future flexibility in meeting anticipated funding needs.\nCash Equivalents and Interest-bearing Deposits in other Financial Institutions\nThe Company holds federal funds sold, unpledged available-for-sale securities and salable government guaranteed loans to help meet liquidity requirements and provide temporary holdings until the funds can be otherwise deployed or invested. As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, we had $13,785,000 and $9,720,000, respectively, in federal funds sold.\nInvestment Securities\nManagement of our investment securities portfolio focuses on providing an adequate level of liquidity and establishing an interest rate-sensitive position, while earning an adequate level of investment income without taking undue risk. Investment securities that we intend to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity securities, and all other investment securities are classified as either available-for-sale or equity securities. Currently, all of our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale, except for one mutual fund classified as an equity security.\nThe fair value of the equity security was $3,297,000 and $3,106,000 at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Consistent with ASU 2016-01, equity securities are carried at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of income. Accordingly, the Company recognized an unrealized gain of $101,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to an unrealized loss of $90,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOur available for sale investment securities holdings decreased by $16,624,000 or 8.0%, to $190,088,000 at December 31, 2019, compared to holdings of $206,712,000 at December 31, 2018. The carrying values of available-for-sale investment securities are adjusted for unrealized gains or losses as a valuation allowance and any gain or loss is reported on an after-tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income.\nTotal investment securities as a percentage of total assets decreased to 16.8% as of December 31, 2019 compared to 19.2% at December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, $123,381,000 of the investment securities were pledged to secure public deposits.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the total unrealized loss on debt securities that were in a loss position for less than 12 continuous months was $257,000 with an aggregate fair value of $21,242,000. The total unrealized loss on debt securities that were in a loss position for greater than 12 continuous months was $915,000 with an aggregate fair value of $36,313,000.\nThe following table summarizes the book value and fair value and distribution of our debt investment securities, which does not include equity securities, as of the dates indicated:\nDebt Investment Securities Portfolio\n\nAt December 31, 2019, one municipality, three U.S. agencies, six corporate debts, five Small Business Administration pools, one collateralized mortgage obligations and eleven asset backed securities make up the total debt securities in an unrealized loss position for greater than 12 months. At December 31, 2019, three U.S. agencies, eight asset backed securities, two SBA pools and two corporate debts make up the total debt securities in a loss position for less than 12 months. Management periodically evaluates each available-for-sale investment security in an unrealized loss position to determine if the impairment is temporary or other than temporary. This evaluation encompasses various factors including, the nature of the investment, the cause of the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, credit ratings and other credit related factors such as third party guarantees and the volatility of the security's fair value. Management has determined that no investment security is other than temporarily impaired. The unrealized losses are due primarily to interest rate changes and the Company does not intend to sell the securities and it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the earlier of the forecasted recovery or the maturity of the underlying investment security. As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any investment securities that constituted 10% or more of the stockholders' equity of any third-party issuer.\nThe following table summarizes the maturity and repricing schedule of our debt investment securities, which does not include equity securities, at their amortized cost and their weighted average yields at December 31, 2019:\nDebt Investment Maturities and Repricing Schedule\n\nYields in the above table have been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis. Securities are reported at the earliest possible call, repricing or maturity date.\nLoans\nThe following table sets forth the amount of total loans outstanding (including net deferred loan fees and costs) and the percentage distributions in each category, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nCommercial real estate loans increased $52,483,000 in 2019 as compared to 2018, due to the increased demand by qualified borrowers in our serving area. Of the commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2019, 61% are non-owner occupied and 39% are owner occupied. Our commercial real estate loan portfolio is weighted towards term loans for which the primary source of repayment is cash flow from net operating income of the real estate property.\nCommercial and industrial loans decreased $4,548,000 in 2019 as compared to 2018. We have historically targeted well-established local businesses with strong guarantors that have proven to be resilient in periods of economic stress.\nOur residential loan portfolio includes no sub-prime loans, nor is it our normal practice to underwrite loans commonly referred to as \"Alt-A mortgages\", the characteristics of which are loans lacking full documentation, borrowers having low FICO scores or collateral compositions reflecting high loan-to-value ratios. Substantially all of our residential loans are indexed to Treasury Constant Maturity Rates and have provisions to reset five years after their origination dates.\nThe following table summarizes our commercial real estate loan portfolio by the geographic location in which the property is located as of December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nConstruction and land loans are classified as commercial real estate loans and increased $30.3 million in 2019 as compared to 2018. The table below shows an analysis of construction loans by type and location. Non-owner-occupied land loans of $8.4 million at December 31, 2019 included loans for lands specified for commercial development of $4.3 million and for residential development of $4.1 million, the majority of which are located in Stanislaus County.\n\n\nLoan Maturities\nThe following table shows the contractual maturity distribution and repricing intervals of the outstanding loans in our portfolio, as of December 31, 2019. In addition, the table shows the distribution of such loans between those with variable or floating interest rates and those with fixed or predetermined interest rates. The large majority of the variable rate loans are tied to independent indices (such as the Wall Street Journal prime rate or a Treasury Constant Maturity Rate). Substantially all loans with an original term of more than five years have provisions for the fixed rates to reset, or convert to a variable rate, after one, three or five years and are therefore classified as a variable rate loan in the table below.\n\nThe majority of the properties taken as collateral are located in Northern California. We employ strict guidelines regarding the use of collateral located in less familiar market areas. Positive trends in Northern California real estate values, the low loan-to-value ratios in our commercial real estate portfolio, and the high percentage of owner-occupied properties further solidify our credit quality position.\nNonperforming Assets\nFinancial institutions generally have a certain level of exposure to credit quality risk and could potentially receive less than a full return of principal and interest if a debtor becomes unable or unwilling to repay. Since loans are the most significant assets of the Company and generate the largest portion of its revenues, the Company's management of credit quality risk is focused primarily on loan quality. Banks have generally suffered their most severe earnings declines due to customers' inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debts and/or downturns in national and regional economies which have brought about declines in overall property values. In addition, certain debt securities that the Company may purchase have the potential of declining in value if the obligor's financial capacity to repay deteriorates.\nNonperforming assets consist of loans on non-accrual status, loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest, loans restructured, where the terms of repayment have been renegotiated resulting in a reduction or deferral of interest or principal and OREO.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days past due, unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection. The past due loans may or may not be adequately collateralized, but collection efforts are continuously pursued. Loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some changes in financial status, causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms, and where we believe the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and repay the loan in full. OREO consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means and which management intends to offer for sale.\nThe Company had nonperforming loans of $1.1 million at December 31, 2019, as compared to $0.9 million at December 31, 2018. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.15% and 0.13% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIn addition, the Company held one OREO property as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, a residential land property that was acquired through foreclosure that was written down to a zero balance because the public utilities have not been obtainable, thereby rendering these land lots unmarketable at this time.\nManagement believes that the reserve provided for nonperforming loans, together with the tangible collateral, were adequate as of December 31, 2019. See Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d below for further discussion. Except as disclosed above, as of December 31, 2019, management was not aware of any material credit problems of borrowers that would cause it to have serious doubts about the ability of a borrower to comply with the present loan payment terms. However, no assurance can be given that credit problems may exist that may not have been brought to the attention of management, or that credit problems may not arise in the future.\nThe following table provides information with respect to the components of our nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. (The figures in the table are net of the portion guaranteed by the U.S. Government):\n\n(1) During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, no interest income related to these loans was included in net income while on nonaccrual status. Additional interest income of approximately $62,000 and $68,000 would have been recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, if these loans had been paid in accordance with their original terms.\n(2) A restructured loan\u201d is one the terms of which were renegotiated to provide a concession because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nIn anticipation of credit risk inherent in our lending business, we set aside allowances through charges to earnings. Such charges are not only made for the outstanding loan portfolio, but also for off-balance sheet items, such as commitments to extend credits or letters of credit. The charges made for the outstanding loan portfolio are credited to the allowance for loan losses, whereas charges for off-balance sheet items are credited to the reserve for off-balance sheet items, which is presented as a component of other liabilities. The provision for loan losses is discussed in the section entitled Provision for Loan Losses\u201d above.\nThe balance of our allowance for loan losses is management's best estimate of the probable losses inherent in the portfolio. The ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the real estate market, changes in interest rate and economic and political environments.\nIn recent years, the economic recovery has had a positive impact on the financial stability of our borrowers resulting in improvements in credit quality of our loan portfolio which has allowed us to reduce the reserve for loan losses as a percentage of gross loans. In 2019, we have continued to benefit from the improved credit quality but due to loan growth, we recognized an increase of $461,000 in the allowance for loan losses to $9,146,000 at December 31, 2019, as compared with $8,685,000 at December 31, 2018. In 2019, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans stabilized at 1.22% as of December 31, 2019 corresponding to our improved credit quality and loan growth, as compared to 1.22% as of December 31, 2018. Based on the current conditions of the loan portfolio, management believes that the $9,146,000 allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio. No assurance can be given, however, that adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the portfolio.\nDiversification, low loan-to-values, strong credit quality and enhanced credit monitoring contribute to a reduction in the portfolio's overall risk in recent years and help to offset the economic risk. We continue to monitor the impact of the economic environment, and adjustments to the provision for loan loss will be made accordingly. During 2019, the Company recognized net loan charge-offs of $84,000 as compared to $36,000 in 2018.\nManagement reviews these conditions with our senior credit officers. To the extent that any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date, management's estimate of the effect of such condition may be reflected as a specific allowance applicable to such credit or portfolio segment. Where any of these conditions is not evidenced by a specific, identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date, management's evaluation of the inherent loss related to such condition is reflected in the unallocated allowance. Although management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loan categories, the adequacy of the allowance is considered in its entirety.\nOur allowance for loan losses consisted of amounts allocated to three phases of our methodology for assessing loan loss allowances, as follows (see details of methodology for assessing allowance for loan losses in the section entitled Critical Accounting Policies\u201d):\n\nThe Components of the Allowance for Loan Losses\nAs stated previously in \"Critical Accounting Policies,\" the overall allowance consists of a specific allowance for individually identified impaired loans, an allowance factor for categories of credits with similar characteristics and trends, and an allowance for changing environmental factors.\nThe first component, the specific allowance, results from the analysis of identified problem credits and the evaluation of sources of repayment including collateral, as applicable. Through management's ongoing loan grading process, individual loans are identified that have conditions that indicate the borrower may be unable to pay all amounts due under the contractual terms. These loans are evaluated individually by management and specified allowances for loan losses are established when the discounted cash flows of future payments or collateral value of collateral-dependent loans are lower than the recorded investment in the loan. Generally, with problem credits that are collateral-dependent, we obtain appraisals of the collateral at least annually. We may obtain appraisals more frequently if we believe the collateral value is subject to market volatility, if a specific event has occurred to the collateral (e.g. tentative map has been filed), or if we believe foreclosure is imminent. Impaired loan balances increased from $920,000 at December 31, 2018 to $1,103,000 at December 31, 2019. The specific allowance totaled $680,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, as we charge off substantially all of our estimated losses related to specifically identified impaired loans as the losses are identified.\nThe second component, the allowance factor, is an estimate of the probable inherent losses in each loan pool stratified by major categories or loans with similar characteristics in our loan portfolio. This analysis encompasses segmenting and reviewing historical losses, loan grades by pool and current general economic and business conditions. Confirmation of the quality of our grading process is obtained by independent reviews conducted by consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by various bank regulatory agencies. This analysis covers our entire loan portfolio but excludes any loans that were analyzed individually for specific allowances as discussed above. There are limitations to any credit risk grading process. The number of loans makes it impractical to review every loan every quarter. Therefore, it is possible that in the future, some currently performing loans not recently graded will not be as strong as their last grading and an insufficient portion of the allowance will have been allocated to them. Grading and loan review often must be done without knowing whether all relevant facts are at hand. Troubled borrowers may deliberately or inadvertently omit important information from reports or conversations with lending officers regarding their financial condition and the diminished strength of repayment sources.\nThe total amount allocated for the second component is determined by applying loss estimation factors based on loss history to outstanding loans. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the allowance allocated by categories of credits totaled $5.3 million and $5.1 million, respectively.\nThe third component of the allowance for loan losses is an economic and qualitative component that is intended to absorb losses caused by portfolio trends, concentration of credit, growth, and economic trends, as stated previously in \"Critical Accounting Policies\". At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the general valuation allowance, including the economic component, totaled $3.1 million and $3.0 million, respectively. While published economic data indicates that the current economic recovery cycle is approaching 10 years, which would be the longest in U.S history, it is uncertain that the recovery cycle will continue for any definite period of time. In response to this, we have been proactive in evaluating reserve percentages for economic and other qualitative loss factors used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The increase to the third component of the allowance for loan losses reflected such evaluation.\nThe table below summarizes, for the periods indicated, loan balances at the end of each period, the daily averages during the period, changes in the allowance for loan losses arising from loans charged off, recoveries on loans previously charged off, additions to the allowance and certain ratios related to the allowance for loan losses:\nAllowance for Loan Losses\n\nThe table below summarizes the allowance for loan loss balance by type of loan balance at the end of each period (See Loan Portfolio\u201d above for a description of each type of loan balance):\nAllocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses\n\nOther Earning Assets\nFor various business purposes, we make investments in earning assets other than the interest-earning securities and loans discussed above. The primary other earning assets held by the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, includes the cash surrender value of the Bank Owned Life Insurance ( BOLI\u201d) policies, Federal Home Loan Bank stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock. During 2019, we purchased 4 new life insurance policies on certain directors and employees for a total investment of $5 million. During 2018, we committed to invest $5 million in a new low-income housing tax credit fund ( LIHTC\u201d) to promote our participation in CRA activities, which had an unfunded commitment of $2,998,000 as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we held another LIHTC investment that we've participated in since 2006, for which the original investment was $1 million, and there were no unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. For both LIHTC investments, we receive the return in the form of tax credits and tax deductions over a period of approximately 15 years. In 2017, we made a $1 million commitment as a limited partner, to a small business private equity partnership to promote our participation in CRA activities. Returns will be received in the form of dividends from the general partner. As of December 31, 2019, we have remaining commitments to fund an additional $520,000 on this investment.\nThe balances of other earning assets as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were as follows:\n\nDeposits and Other Sources of Funds\nDeposits\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $1,019,929 and $986,495,000, respectively, representing an increase of $33,434,000 or 3.4% in 2019. The average deposits for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $3,536,000 or 0.4% to $964,444,000 compared to $967,980,000 at December 31, 2018.\nDeposits are the Company's primary source of funds. Due to strategic emphasis by management, core deposits (based on definition provided by FDIC's Uniform Bank Performance Report) increased by $33.5 million or 3.3% in 2019 to $1.00 billion at December 31, 2019. The percentage of core deposits to total deposits increased slightly to 98.2% at December 31, 2019 as compared to 98.1% at December 31, 2018. The average rate paid on time deposits in denominations of over $250,000 was 0.47% and 0.36% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The composition and cost of the Company's deposit base are important components in analyzing the Company's net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics, both of which are discussed in greater detail in other sections herein. See Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\u201d for further discussion.\nThe Company's liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments or, in other words, by the propensity of that money to leave the institution for rate-related or other reasons. Deposits can be adversely affected if economic conditions in California and the Company's market area in particular, continue to weaken. Potentially, the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are jumbo certificates of deposit, meaning time deposits with balances that equal or exceed $250,000, as customers with balances of that magnitude are typically more rate-sensitive than customers with smaller balances.\nThe following tables summarize the distribution of average daily deposits and the average daily rates paid for the periods indicated:\nDistribution of Average Daily Deposits\n\nThe scheduled maturities of our time deposits in denominations of more than $250,000 at December 31, 2019 are, as follows:\nMaturities of Time Deposits over $250,000\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n\nBecause our client base is comprised primarily of commercial and industrial accounts, individual account balances are generally higher than those of consumer-oriented banks. Four of our clients carry deposit balances of more than 1% of our total deposits, none of which had a deposit balance of more than 3% of total deposits at December 31, 2019. The Company had no brokered deposits as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nFHLB Borrowings\nAlthough deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for general business purposes, we may obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco ( FHLB\u201d) as an alternative to retail deposit funds. We had no outstanding balances as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 or at any time during 2019 and 2018. See Liquidity Management\u201d below for the details on the FHLB borrowings program.\nReturn on Equity and Assets\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding our return on equity and assets for the periods indicated:\n\nDeferred Compensation Obligations\nWe maintain a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan for certain key management personnel. Under this plan, participating employees may defer compensation, which will entitle them to receive certain payments upon retirement, death, or disability. The plan provides for payments commencing upon retirement and reduced benefits upon early retirement, disability, or termination of employment. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our aggregate payment obligations under this plan totaled $9.9 million and $8.0 million, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the ordinary course of business, we provide various forms of credit lines to meet the financing needs of our customers. These commitments, which represent a credit risk to us, are not represented in any form on our balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2019, and 2018, we had commitments to extend credit of $164.7 million and $153.9 million, respectively. Obligations under standby letters of credit, included in total commitments to extend credit, were $3.1 million and $2.3 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and there were no obligations under commercial letters of credit for either period.\nThe effect on our revenues, expenses, cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used. For more information regarding our off balance sheet arrangements, see Note 13- Commitments and Other Contingencies- to our 2019 year-end consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following chart summarizes certain contractual obligations of the Company as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):\n\nAs permitted or required under California law and to the maximum extent allowable under that law, we have certain obligations to indemnify our current and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. These indemnification obligations are valid as long as the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, our best interests, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited; however, we have a director and officer insurance policy that mitigates our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal.\nLiquidity and Asset/Liability Management\nManagement seeks to ascertain optimum and stable utilization of available assets and liabilities as a vehicle to attain our overall business plans and objectives. In this regard, management focuses on measurement and control of liquidity risk, interest rate risk and market risk, capital adequacy, operation risk and credit risk.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity to meet borrowers' credit and depositors' withdrawal demands is provided by maturing assets, short-term liquid assets that can be converted to cash and the ability to attract funds from depositors. Additional sources of liquidity may include institutional deposits, advances from the FHLB and other short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased.\nSince our deposit growth strategy emphasizes core deposit growth, we have avoided relying on brokered deposits as a consistent source of funds. The Company had no brokered deposits as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nAs a secondary source of liquidity, we rely on advances from the FHLB to supplement our supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. Advances from the FHLB are typically secured by a portion of our loan portfolio and stock issued by the FHLB. The FHLB determines limitations on the amounts of advances by assigning a percentage to each eligible loan category that will count towards the borrowing capacity. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no FHLB advances outstanding and had sufficient collateral to borrow an additional $275.2 million and $268.9 million, respectively. In addition, the Company had lines of credit with its correspondent banks to purchase overnight federal funds totaling $30 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. No advances were made on these lines of credit as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe Company's liquidity depends primarily on dividends paid to it as the sole shareholder of the Bank. The Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Company may depend on whether the Bank will be in a position to pay dividends based on regulatory requirements and the performance of the Bank.\nMaintenance of adequate liquidity requires that sufficient resources be available at all time to meet our cash flow requirements. Liquidity in a banking institution is required primarily to provide for deposit withdrawals and the credit needs of its customers and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise. Liquidity management involves our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without incurring significant loss, and to raise cash or maintain funds without incurring excessive additional cost. For this purpose, we maintain a portion of our funds in cash and cash equivalents, loans and securities available for sale. Our liquid assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018 totaled approximately $227.6 million and $238.5 million, respectively. Our liquidity level measured as the percentage of liquid assets to total assets was 19.8% and 21.8% at December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nCapital Resources and Capital Adequacy Requirements\nIn the past two years, our primary source of capital has been internally generated operating income through retained earnings. At December 31, 2019, total shareholders' equity increased to $112.6 million, representing an increase of $13.5 million from December 31, 2018. The increase was due to net income of $12.5 million recorded to retained earnings, and other comprehensive income of $2.8 million, net of income taxes, due to the positive effect that declining treasury yields had on the unrealized market value adjustment of our available for sale investment portfolio during 2019. Also, retained earnings was reduced by the common stock dividend payments totaling $2.2 million during 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures.\nWe are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements and operations. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we must meet specific capital guidelines that rely on the quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. (See Description of Business-Regulation and Supervision-Capital Adequacy Requirements\u201d in this report for exact definitions and regulatory capital requirements.)\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were qualified as a well capitalized institution\u201d under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. The following table presents the regulatory minimums for well-capitalized institutions, compared to the Bank's capital ratios as of the dates specified:\n\n(1) The Regulatory Minimum\u201d thresholds
