increased by $69.2 million in 2018, compared to 2017. In the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment, segment net operating results increased by $71.1 million due primarily to lower catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) and the favorable impact of loss and LAE reserve development, partially offset by higher insurance expenses as a percentage of earned premiums. See MD&A, Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 33 for additional discussion of the segment's results. In the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment, segment net operating results increased by $59.5 million due primarily to the impact of lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums on a higher level of earned premiums, higher net investment income and lower levels of adverse loss and LAE reserve development, partially offset by the impact of higher insurance expenses as a percentage of earned premiums on a higher level of earned premiums and driven by the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments associated with Kemper's acquisition of Infinity. See MD&A, Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 40 for additional discussion\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nSUMMARY OF RESULTS (Continued)\nof the segment's results. In the Life & Health Insurance segment, segment net operating income decreased by $0.4 million due primarily to higher policyholders' benefits and incurred losses and LAE and lower net investment income, almost entirely offset by lower income tax expense due to the lower corporate income tax rate in 2018. See MD&A, Life & Health Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 45 for additional discussion of the segment's results. Additionally, the Company's results were impacted in 2018, compared to 2017, by transaction and integration costs associated with Kemper's acquisition of Infinity and a loss from the change in the fair value of the Company's equity security portfolio, for which such changes are recorded through the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2018, compared to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, in 2017, partially offset by the positive effects of tax law changes and the partial satisfaction of a legal judgment. See MD&A, Investment Results,\u201d beginning on page 50 and MD&A, Income Taxes,\u201d beginning on page 57 and Note 23, Contingencies.\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n2017 Compared with 2016\nThe Company's net income increased by $104.1 million in 2017, compared to 2016. In the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment, segment net operating results deteriorated by $61.0 million due primarily to higher incurred catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) and an unfavorable change in loss and LAE reserve development, partially offset by higher net investment income. See MD&A, Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 33 for additional discussion of the segment's results. In the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment, segment net operating results increased by $70.8 million due primarily to lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums, lower insurance expenses as a percentage of earned premiums and higher net investment income. See MD&A, Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 40 for additional discussion of the segment's results. In the Life & Health Insurance segment, segment net operating income increased by $60.9 million due primarily to a $50.5 million after-tax charge in 2016 to recognize the impact of using death verification databases in the Company's operations, including to determine its IBNR liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses for life insurance products. See MD&A, Life & Health Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 45 for additional discussion of the segment's results. The Company's results were also positively impacted in 2017, compared to 2016, by higher net realized gains on sales of investments, lower impairment losses recognized in earnings and a lower unallocated net operating loss, due primarily to an income tax benefit of $7.4 million to recognize the effects of changes in the federal income tax law. See MD&A, Investment Results,\u201d beginning on page 50 and MD&A, Income Taxes,\u201d beginning on page 57 for additional information.\nRevenues\n2018 Compared with 2017\nEarned Premiums were $3,384.4 million in 2018, compared to $2,350.0 million in 2017, an increase of $1,034.4 million driven primarily by growth in Kemper's legacy specialty personal automobile insurance and the acquisition of Infinity. Earned Premiums increased by $1,021.7 million, $0.4 million and $12.3 million in the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment, Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance Segment and Life & Health Insurance segment, respectively. See MD&A, Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 40, MD&A, Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 33 and MD&A, Life & Health Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 45 for discussion of the changes in each segment's earned premiums.\nNet Investment Income increased by $13.7 million in 2018 due primarily to a higher level of investments in fixed income securities and short-term securities, partially offset by a lower rate of return from Alternative Investments, lower yields on fixed income securities and the impact of presenting Fair Value Option Investments within Loss from Change in Fair Value of Equity and Convertible Securities (outside of Net Investment Income) as of January 1, 2018. Net Investment Income from Alternative Investments, which consist of Equity Method Limited Liability Investments, Fair Value Option Investments and other limited liability investments included in Equity Securities at Fair Value or Equity Securities at Modified Cost, decreased by $17.3 million. Alternative investment income from Equity Method Limited Liability Investments decreased by $13.8 million. Alternative investment income from limited liability investments included in either Equity Securities at Fair Value or Equity Securities at Modified Cost decreased by $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017. No Net Investment Income was recorded on Fair Value Option Investments for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1.3 million for the same period in 2017. See MD&A, Investment Results,\u201d under the sub-caption Net Investment Income\u201d beginning on page 50 for additional discussion.\nOther Income increased by $38.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, due primarily to the the partial satisfaction of a final judgment against Computer Sciences Corporation ( CSC\u201d). See Note 23,\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nSUMMARY OF RESULTS (Continued)\nContingencies.\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The Company cannot make any assurance as to the additional amounts of the final judgment that will actually be collected or when they may be received. The unpaid balance of the final judgment is treated as a gain contingency for accounting purposes and accordingly, is not recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, in 2018. As a result of adoption, beginning in 2018, changes in the fair value of the Company's investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Loss from Change in Fair Value of Equity and Convertible Securities recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $64.3 million in 2018. Prior to 2018, changes in the fair value of equity securities were recognized in other comprehensive income. See MD&A, Investment Results,\u201d under the sub-caption Loss from Change in Fair Value of Equity and Convertible Securities\u201d beginning on page 51 for additional discussion\nNet Realized Gains on Sales of Investments were $26.4 million in 2018, compared to $56.5 million in 2017. See MD&A, Investment Results,\u201d under the sub-caption Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments\u201d beginning on page 52 for additional discussion. Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings in 2018 and 2017 were $4.5 million and $14.3 million, respectively. See MD&A, Investment Results,\u201d under the sub-caption Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings\u201d beginning on page 52 for additional discussion. The Company cannot predict when or if similar investment gains or losses may occur in the future.\n2017 Compared with 2016\nEarned Premiums were $2,350.0 million in 2017, compared to $2,220.0 million in 2016, an increase of $130.0 million. Earned Premiums increased by $132.4 million and $8.8 million in the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance and Life & Health Insurance segments, respectively. Earned Premiums decreased by $11.2 million in the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment. See MD&A, Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 33, MD&A Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 40, and MD&A, Life & Health Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 45 for discussion of the changes in each segment's earned premiums.\nNet Investment Income increased by $28.9 million in 2017 due primarily to higher investment returns from Alternative Investments and higher levels of investments in fixed income securities, partially offset by lower yields on fixed income securities. Net Investment Income from Alternative Investments, which consist of Equity Method Limited Liability Investments, Fair Value Option Investments and other limited liability investments included in Equity Securities, increased by $27.1 million. Alternative investment income from Equity Method Limited Liability Investments, other limited liability investments included in Equity Securities, and Fair Value Option Investments increased by $17.3 million, $6.6 million and $3.2 million, respectively, in 2017, compared to 2016. See MD&A, Investment Results,\u201d under the sub-caption Net Investment Income\u201d beginning on page 50 for additional discussion.\nNet Realized Gains on Sales of Investments were $56.5 million in 2017, compared to $33.1 million in 2016. See MD&A, Investment Results,\u201d under the sub-caption Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments\u201d beginning on page 52 for additional discussion. Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings in 2017 and 2016 were $14.3 million and $32.7 million, respectively. See MD&A, Investment Results,\u201d under the sub-caption Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings\u201d beginning on page 52 for additional discussion. The Company cannot predict when or if similar investment gains or losses may occur in the future.\nCATASTROPHES\nCatastrophes and natural disasters are inherent risks of the property and casualty insurance business. These catastrophic events and natural disasters include, without limitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, hailstorms, wildfires, high winds and winter storms. Such events result in insured losses that are, and will continue to be, a material factor in the results of operations and financial position of the Company's property and casualty insurance companies. Further, because the level of these insured losses occurring in any one year cannot be accurately predicted, these losses may contribute to material year-to-year fluctuations in the results of operations and financial position of these companies. Specific types of catastrophic events are more likely to occur at certain times within the year than others. This factor adds an element of seasonality to property and casualty insurance claims. The Company has adopted the industry-wide catastrophe classifications of storms and other events promulgated by ISO to track and report losses related to catastrophes. ISO classifies a disaster as a catastrophe when the event causes $25.0 million or more in direct insured losses to property and affects a significant number of policyholders and insurers. ISO-classified catastrophes are assigned a unique serial number recognized throughout the insurance industry.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCATASTROPHES (Continued)\nThe number of ISO-classified catastrophic events and catastrophe losses and LAE, net of reinsurance recoveries, (excluding loss and LAE reserve development) by range of loss and business segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are presented below.

Coverage under the catastrophe reinsurance program is provided in various contracts and layers. The Company's Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance and Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segments also purchase reinsurance from the FHCF for hurricane losses in Florida at retentions lower than its catastrophe reinsurance program. The Life & Health Insurance segment also purchases reinsurance from the FHCF for hurricane losses in Florida. Except for the coverage provided by the FHCF, the Life & Health Insurance segment does not carry any other catastrophe reinsurance coverage.\nIn 2018 and 2017, the Company had catastrophe reinsurance recoveries of $31.8 million and $11.9 million under its catastrophe reinsurance programs, respectively. Catastrophe recoveries under the FHCF were not material in 2018 or 2017. In 2018 and 2017, the Company paid $0.4 million and $0.8 million in reinstatement premium, respectively. The Company did not pay any reinstatement premium in 2016.\nSee the Reinsurance\u201d subsection of the Property and Casualty Insurance Business\u201d and Life and Health Insurance Business\u201d sections of Item 1(c), Description of Business,\u201d and Note 20, Catastrophe Reinsurance,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's reinsurance programs.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nLOSS AND LAE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT\nIncreases (decreases) in the Company's property and casualty loss and LAE reserves for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 to recognize adverse (favorable) loss and LAE reserve development from prior accident years in continuing operations, hereinafter also referred to as reserve development\u201d in the discussion of segment results, are presented below.

See MD&A, Critical Accounting Estimates,\u201d of this 2018 Annual Report for additional information pertaining to the Company's process of estimating property and casualty insurance reserves for losses and LAE, and the estimated variability thereof, development of property and casualty insurance losses and LAE, and a discussion of some of the variables that may impact them.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nPursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, the Company is required to file consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The Company is permitted to include non-GAAP financial measures in its filings provided that they are defined along with an explanation of their usefulness to investors, are no more prominent than the comparable GAAP financial measures and are reconciled to such GAAP financial measures.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for the comparable GAAP financial measures, as they do not fully recognize the overall profitability of the Company's businesses.\nUnderlying Combined Ratio\nThe following discussions of segment results use the non-GAAP financial measures of (i) Underlying Losses and LAE and (ii) Underlying Combined Ratio. Underlying Losses and LAE (also referred to in the discussion as Current Year Non-catastrophe Losses and LAE\u201d) exclude the impact of catastrophe losses and loss and LAE reserve development from prior years from the Company's Incurred Losses and LAE, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Underlying Combined Ratio is computed by adding the Current Year Non-catastrophe Losses and LAE Ratio with the Insurance Expense Ratio. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is the Combined Ratio, which is computed by adding total incurred losses and LAE, including the impact of catastrophe losses and loss and LAE reserve development from prior years, with the Insurance Expense Ratio. The Company believes Underlying Losses and LAE and the Underlying Combined Ratio are useful to investors and are used by management to reveal the trends in the Company's Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance and Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance businesses that may be obscured by catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development. These catastrophe losses may cause the Company's loss trends to vary significantly between\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nperiods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on incurred losses and LAE and the combined ratio. Prior-year reserve developments are caused by unexpected loss development on historical reserves. Because reserve development relates to the re-estimation of losses from earlier years, it has no bearing on the performance of the Company's insurance products that were in force in the current period. The Company believes it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's underwriting performance.\nAdjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income\nAdjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income is an after-tax, non-GAAP financial measure and is computed by excluding from Income from Continuing Operations the after-tax impact of:\n1) Income (Loss) from Change in Fair Value of Equity and Convertible Securities;\n2) Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments;\n3) Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings related to investments;\n4) Acquisition Related Transaction, Integration and Other Costs;\n5) Loss from Early Extinguishment of Debt; and\n6) Significant non-recurring or infrequent items that may not be indicative of ongoing operations.\nSignificant non-recurring items are excluded when (a) the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years, and (b) there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is Income from Continuing Operations. There were no applicable significant non-recurring items that the Company excluded from the calculation of Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016.\nThe Company believes that Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income provides investors with a valuable measure of its ongoing performance because it reveals underlying operational performance trends that otherwise might be less apparent if the items were not excluded. Income (Loss) from Change in Fair Value of Equity and Convertible Securities, Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments and Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings related to investments included in the Company's results may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and external economic developments such as capital market conditions that impact the values of the Company's investments, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Acquisition Related Transaction, Integration and Other Costs may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by the timing of acquisitions and business decisions which are unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Loss from Early Extinguishment of Debt is driven by the Company's financing and refinancing decisions and capital needs, as well as external economic developments such as debt market conditions, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Significant non-recurring items are excluded because, by their nature, they are not indicative of the Company's business or economic trends.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nPREFERRED PROPERTY & CASUALTY INSURANCE\nSelected financial information for the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment is presented below.

property and casualty insurance reserves for losses and LAE, development of property and casualty insurance losses and LAE from prior accident years, also referred to as reserve development\u201d in the discussion of segment results, estimated variability of property and casualty insurance reserves for losses and LAE, and a discussion of some of the variables that may impact development of property and casualty insurance losses and LAE and the estimated variability of property and casualty insurance reserves for losses and LAE.\nOverall\n2018 Compared with 2017\nThe Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment reported Segment Net Operating Income of $25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to Segment Net Operating Loss of $45.4 million in 2017. Segment net operating results improved by $71.1 million due primarily to lower current year catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding loss and LAE reserve development) and the favorable impact of loss and LAE reserve development, partially offset by higher insurance expense as a percentage of earned premiums.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nPREFERRED PROPERTY & CASUALTY INSURANCE (Continued)\nEarned Premiums in the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment increased by $0.4 million in 2018, compared to 2017, as higher average earned premium accounted for an increase of $21.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in volume of $21.0 million. All product lines experienced an increase in average earned premium, although the overall impact on Earned Premiums was driven primarily by preferred personal automobile insurance, which had increases due to higher average earned premium of $19.5 million. The lower volume was driven by homeowners insurance and preferred personal automobile insurance which had volume decreases of $15.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively.\nNet Investment Income in the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment increased by $2.9 million in 2018, compared to 2017, due primarily to higher levels of fixed maturity investments and higher income from fixed maturity investments, partially offset by lower income from Alternative Investments. The Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment reported Net Investment Income from Alternative Investments of $18.6 million 2018, compared to $22.5 million in 2017.\nUnderlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were 62.9% in both 2018 and 2017. Underlying incurred losses and LAE exclude the impact of catastrophes and loss and LAE reserve development. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $87.3 million in 2018, compared to $173.5 million in 2017, which is a decrease of $86.2 million due primarily to lower losses on California wildfires in 2018, compared 2017, due in part to reinsurance recoveries in 2018 under the aggregate property catastrophe reinsurance contract and fewer catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) from events with greater than $20.0 million in losses and LAE. Favorable loss and LAE reserve development (including catastrophe reserve development) was $8.3 million in 2018, compared to adverse development of $15.7 million in 2017. Adverse development in 2017 was driven primarily by preferred personal automobile insurance.\nInsurance expenses were $225.5 million, or 30.9% of earned premiums, in 2018, an increase of 1.1 percentage points compared to 2017, driven primarily by increased ceded premiums in 2018 under the Company's aggregate property catastrophe reinsurance contract.\nThe Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment's effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions. Tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions were $8.5 million in 2018, compared to $13.9 million in 2017.\n2017 Compared with 2016\nThe Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment reported Segment Net Operating Loss of $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to Segment Net Operating Income of $15.6 million in 2016. Segment net operating results deteriorated by $61.0 million due primarily to higher incurred catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) and an unfavorable change in loss and LAE reserve development, partially offset by higher net investment income and cost containment measures.\nEarned premiums in the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment decreased by $11.2 million in 2017, compared to 2016 as lower volume accounted for a decrease of $32.6 million, while higher average earned premium accounted for an increase of $21.4 million. The lower volume was driven primarily by preferred personal automobile insurance and homeowners insurance, which had volume decreases of $16.6 million and $13.2 million, respectively.\nNet Investment Income in the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment increased by $10.3 million in 2017, compared to 2016, due primarily to higher investment income from Alternative Investments, and to a lesser extent, higher levels of non-alternative investments. The Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment reported Net Investment Income from Alternative Investments of $22.5 million in 2017, compared to $12.6 million in 2016.\nUnderlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were 62.9% in 2017, an increase of 0.1% percentage points, compared to 2016, driven primarily by increases in preferred automobile insurance, partially offset by decreases in homeowners insurance. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $173.5 million in 2017, compared to $103.1 million in 2016, which is an increase of $70.4 million due primarily to California wildfires and higher average severity on catastrophic events with losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) of less than $15.0 million in 2017, compared to 2016. This increase was partially offset by two large catastrophes, both Texas hailstorms, occurring in 2016, with aggregated estimated losses and LAE of $61.9 million, compared to one such Texas hailstorm, occurring in 2017, with estimated losses and LAE of $43.9 million. Adverse loss and LAE reserve development (including catastrophe reserve development) was $15.7 million in 2017, compared to favorable development of $23.4 million in 2016. Adverse development in 2017 was driven primarily by preferred automobile insurance.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nPREFERRED PROPERTY & CASUALTY INSURANCE (Continued)\nInsurance expenses were $217.8 million, or 29.8% of earned premiums, in 2017, an improvement of 1.1 percentage points compared to 2016, driven primarily by cost reduction initiatives and an increase in the percentage of software development costs eligible for capitalization.\nThe Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment's effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions. Tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions were $13.9 million in 2017, compared to $13.7 million in 2016.\nPreferred Personal Automobile Insurance\nSelected financial information for the preferred personal automobile insurance product line is presented below.

The decrease in earned premium attributed to lower volume was primarily due to the run-off of the direct-to-consumer business. Incurred losses and LAE were $310.2 million, or 70.5% of earned premiums, in 2018, compared to $339.6 million, or 80.3% of earned premiums, in 2017. Incurred losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums decreased due primarily to a favorable change in loss and LAE reserve development, lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of related earned premiums and lower catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development). Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of related earned premiums were 70.2% in 2018, compared to 73.0% in 2017, which was an improvement of 2.8 percentage points due primarily to lower frequency of claims and higher average earned premiums, partially offset by higher severity of losses, particularly on bodily injury coverages. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $7.2 million in 2018, compared to $11.3 million in 2017. Favorable loss and LAE reserve development was $5.8 million in 2018, compared to adverse development of $19.3 million in 2017.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nPREFERRED PROPERTY & CASUALTY INSURANCE (Continued)\n2017 Compared with 2016\nEarned premiums in preferred personal automobile insurance decreased by $1.8 million in 2017, compared to 2016, as lower volume accounted for a decrease of $16.6 million, while higher average earned premium accounted for an increase of $14.8 million.

Incurred losses and LAE were $339.6 million, or 80.3% of earned premiums, in 2017, compared to $324.2 million, or 76.4% of earned premiums, in 2016. Incurred losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums increased due primarily to a higher level of adverse loss and LAE reserve development and higher underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of related earned premiums. Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of related earned premiums were 73.0% in 2017, compared to 72.6% in 2016, which was a deterioration of 0.4 percentage points due primarily to higher severity of losses, particularly on bodily injury coverages, partially offset by lower frequency of claims on most coverages, particularly bodily injury. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $11.3 million in 2017, compared to $11.6 million in 2016, both periods experiencing higher losses than average due primarily to Hurricane Harvey in 2017, and hailstorms in Texas in 2017 and 2016.

Incurred losses and LAE were $18.3 million, or 45.3% of earned premiums, in 2018, compared to $22.1 million, or 51.8% of earned premiums, in 2017. Incurred losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums decreased due to lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums and a higher level of favorable loss and LAE reserve development. Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were 47.3% in 2018, compared to 51.1% in 2017, which was an improvement of 3.8 percentage points due primarily to lower frequency of claims and higher average earned premiums, partially offset by higher severity of losses.

Incurred losses and LAE were $22.1 million, or 51.8% of earned premiums, in 2017, compared to $16.6 million, or 36.9% of earned premiums, in 2016. Incurred losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums increased due to a lower level of favorable loss and LAE reserve development, higher catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) and, to a lesser extent, higher underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums. Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were 51.1% in 2017, compared to 49.1% in 2016, which was a deterioration of 2.0 percentage points due primarily to higher frequency of umbrella claims, partially offset by lower severity of losses on umbrella claims. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $4.9 million in 2017, compared to $2.5 million in 2016.

development of property and casualty insurance losses and LAE and the estimated variability of property and casualty insurance reserves for losses and LAE.\nAcquisition of Infinity\nAs discussed in Note 3, Acquisition of Business,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company completed its acquisition of Infinity on July 2, 2018. The results of its operations have been included in the preceding tables of selected financial information for the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment from the date of its acquisition and forward. Infinity is a national provider of auto insurance focused on serving the specialty, nonstandard segment. With approximately 10,600 independent agents and $1.4 billion in 2017 direct written premiums, Infinity is one of the largest specialty auto insurers in the United States.\nOverall\n2018 Compared with 2017\nThe Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment reported Segment Net Operating Income of $115.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $56.3 million in 2017. Segment net operating results improved by $59.5 million due primarily to the impact of lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums on a higher level of earned premiums, particularly in the Company's specialty personal automobile insurance business, higher net investment income and lower levels of adverse loss and LAE reserve development, partially offset by the impact of higher insurance expenses as a percentage of earned premiums on a higher level of earned premiums and driven by the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments associated with Kemper's acquisition of Infinity.\nEarned Premiums in the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment increased by $1,021.7 million in 2018, compared to 2017. Infinity accounted for $758.1 million of the increase while higher volume and higher average earned premium on Kemper's legacy business accounted for increases of $198.9 million and $64.7 million, respectively. Both of Kemper's legacy product lines experienced an increase in average earned premium, although the overall impact on Earned Premiums was driven primarily by specialty personal automobile insurance which had increases due to higher average earned premium of $61.9 million. Kemper's legacy's higher volume was driven by specialty personal automobile insurance, which had a volume increase of $202.9 million, partially offset primarily by a volume decrease in commercial automobile insurance of $4.0 million.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nSPECIALTY PROPERTY & CASUALTY INSURANCE (Continued)\nNet Investment Income in the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment increased by $24.2 million in 2018, compared to 2017, due primarily to higher levels of investments due in large part to growth in Kemper's legacy specialty automobile insurance business and the acquisition of Infinity, partially offset by lower income from Alternative Investments. The Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment reported Net Investment Income from Alternative Investments of $19.1 million in 2018, compared to $14.9 million in 2017.\nUnderlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were 74.9% in 2018, a decrease of 3.8 percentage points, compared to 2017, driven by both specialty personal automobile insurance and commercial automobile insurance product lines, particularly in the Infinity business which historically had lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums. Underlying losses and LAE exclude the impact of catastrophes and loss and LAE reserve development. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $4.7 million in 2018, compared to $5.5 million in 2017, which is a decrease of $0.8 million. Adverse loss and LAE reserve development (including catastrophe reserve development) was $1.7 million in 2018, compared to $3.8 million in 2017.\nInsurance expenses were $421.7 million, or 20.8% of earned premiums, in 2018, an increase of 4.4 percentage points, compared to 2017, driven primarily by the amortization of Infinity purchase accounting adjustments.\nThe Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment's effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions. Tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions were $11.5 million in 2018, compared to $11.7 million in 2017.\n2017 Compared with 2016\nThe Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment reported Segment Net Operating Income of $56.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to Segment Net Operating Loss of $14.5 million in 2016. Segment net operating results improved by $70.8 million due primarily to lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums, in both the specialty automobile and commercial automobile product lines, lower insurance expenses as a percentage of earned premiums, higher net investment income from Alternative Investments and lower levels of adverse loss and LAE reserve development.\nEarned Premiums in the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment increased by $132.4 million in 2017, compared to 2016, as higher average earned premium and higher volume accounted for increases of $81.9 million and $50.5 million, respectively. The increase in average earned premium was driven by both the specialty automobile and commercial automobile product lines, with increases in average earned premium of $77.7 million and $4.2 million, respectively. The higher volume was driven by specialty automobile insurance, which had a volume increase of $56.6 million, partially offset by a volume decrease in commercial automobile insurance of $6.1 million.\nNet Investment Income in the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment increased by $10.1 million in 2017, compared to 2016, due primarily to higher investment income from Alternative Investments, and to a lesser extent, higher levels of non-alternative investments. The Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment reported Net Investment Income from Alternative Investments of $14.9 million in 2017, compared to $7.6 million in 2016.\nUnderlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were 78.7% in 2017, a decrease of 8.1% percentage points, compared to 2016, driven primarily by improvements in specialty automobile insurance.

Insurance expenses decreased by $3.4 million in 2017, compared to 2016, due primarily to a higher portion of agent compensation for KHSC being deferrable as well as lower legal and agent incentive conference expenses for KHSC, partially offset by higher commission and other general expenses for Reserve National.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nLIFE & HEALTH INSURANCE (Continued)\nAccident and Health Insurance\nSelected financial information for the accident and health insurance product line is presented below.\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DOLLARS IN MILLIONS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earned Premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Investment Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholders' Benefits and Incurred Losses and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Tax Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Product Line Net Operating Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 Compared with 2017\nEarned premiums on accident and health insurance increased by $15.8 million in 2018, compared to 2017, due primarily to higher volume on accident and health insurance products offered by Reserve National.

Insurance Expenses decreased by $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016, due primarily to growth in business, partially offset by lower amortization of insurance in force.\nInterest and Other Expenses\nInterest expense increased by $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017, due primarily to higher levels of debt outstanding to facilitate the funding of the acquisition of Infinity. Interest expense decreased by $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016, due primarily to lower levels of debt outstanding and a lower average effective interest rate thereon. See MD&A, Liquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d and Note 7, Debt,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of debt activity.\nOther Expenses increased by $69.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017, due primarily to the acquisition of Infinity, the inclusion of acquisition related transaction, integration and other costs and higher employee compensation. Other Expenses decreased by $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016, due primarily to lower pension expense in 2017 resulting from the full-year effect of freezing benefit accruals under the Company's defined benefit pension plans and a longer amortization period to amortize actuarial losses, as discussed in Note 16 Pension Benefits\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, partially offset by net curtailment gains recognized in 2016, higher employee compensation and a charge to earnings in 2017 to record the ineffective portion of a hedging relationship related to the Company's debt issuance.\nINCOME TAXES\nOn December 22, 2017, Public Law 115-97, more commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), was enacted. The Tax Act includes numerous changes to existing federal income tax law, including a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. In 2017, pursuant to Staff Accounting Bulletin\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nINCOME TAXES (Continued)\nNo. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d), the Company recorded certain provisional amounts for the estimated income tax effects of the Tax Act on deferred income taxes.\nIn 2018, the Company finalized its determination of the effects of the Tax Act on deferred income taxes based on information received from third parties, completion of actuarial tax computations that impacted the amount of deductions related to reserves reportable for federal income tax purposes for tax years prior to 2018, and other items. As a result, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 in connection with the finalization of the tax effects, which was primarily attributable to the effect of the updated actuarial tax computations.\nThe Company's effective income tax rate from continuing operations differs from the Federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to (1) the Tax Act, (2) the effects of tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions, (3) certain indemnification recoveries recognized in earnings that result in an adjustment in the tax purchase price and are excluded from the determination of taxable income, and (4) the net effects of state income taxes.\nThe tax benefit recorded pursuant to the Tax Act was $26.4 million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions were $22.4 million, $28.0 million and $28.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Estimated indemnification recoveries recognized in earnings result in an adjustment in the tax purchase price and are excluded from the determination of taxable income and income tax expense. Such recoveries were $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. State income tax expense, net of federal benefit, from continuing operations was $0.1 million and $0.6 million in 2018 and 2016, respectively. State income tax benefit, net of federal expense, from continuing operations was $0.1 million in 2017. See Note 15, Income Taxes,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of income taxes.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAmended and Extended Credit Agreement and Term Loan Facility\nOn June 8, 2018, the Company entered into an amended and extended credit agreement and term loan facility. The amended and extended credit agreement increased the borrowing capacity of the existing unsecured credit agreement to $300.0 million and extended the maturity date to June 8, 2023. The term loan facility includes a delayed draw feature with borrowing capacity of $250.0 million and a maturity date two years from the borrowing date. Furthermore, the amended and extended credit agreement provides for an accordion feature whereby the Company can increase either the revolving credit or term loan borrowing capacity by $100.0 million. On June 29, 2018, the Company borrowed $250.0 million on the delayed draw term loan facility to facilitate the funding of the acquisition of Infinity. The proceeds from the term loan facility, net of debt issuance costs, were $249.4 million. On December 28, 2018, the Company repaid $215.0 million of the outstanding term loan. There were no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017 under the revolving credit agreement.\nInfinity Debt\nInfinity's liabilities at the acquisition date included $275.0 million principal amount, 5.0% Senior Notes due September 19, 2022 (the 2022 Infinity Senior Notes\u201d). The 2022 Senior Notes were recorded at a fair value of $282.1 million as of the acquisition date, with the $7.1 million premium being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term, resulting in an effective interest rate of 4.4%. On November 30, 2018 Kemper executed a guarantee to fully and unconditionally guarantee the payment and performance obligations of the 2022 Infinity Senior Notes.\nLong-term Debt\nThe Company has $450.0 million of 4.35% senior notes due February 15, 2025 (the 2025 Senior Notes\u201d) outstanding as of December 31, 2018. The Company initially issued $250.0 million of the 2025 Senior Notes in February of 2015. In June of 2017, Kemper issued an additional $200 million of the 2025 Senior Notes. The proceeds of the additional issuance were $200.2 million, net of discount and transaction costs, for an effective yield of 4.16%. The additional notes are fungible with the initial notes issued in 2015, and together are treated as part of a single series for all purposes under the indenture governing the 2025 Senior Notes. Kemper used the net proceeds from the additional issuance for general corporate purposes. The 2025 Senior Notes are unsecured and may be redeemed in whole at any time or in part from time to time at Kemper's option at specified redemption prices.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Continued)\nShort-term Debt\nKemper's subsidiaries, United Insurance and Trinity Universal Insurance Company ( Trinity\u201d), are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) of Chicago and Dallas, respectively. As a requirement of membership in the FHLB, United Insurance and Trinity maintain a certain level of investment in FHLB stock. Total holdings of FHLB of Chicago stock were $0.8 million and $0.4 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Total holdings of FHLB of Dallas stock were $3.3 million at both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nIn June of 2018, United Insurance received advances of $55.0 million from the FHLB of Chicago and Trinity received advances of $55.0 million from the FHLB of Dallas. The advances, which were repaid in full on July 13, 2018, were made to facilitate the funding of the acquisition of Infinity.\nIn March of 2018, United Insurance received advances of $10.0 million from the FHLB of Chicago. The advances, which mature in one year or less, were made in connection with the start-up of the Company's collateralized investment borrowing program. In connection with the advances, United Insurance pledged U.S. Government Agency securities with a fair value of $15.7 million at December 31, 2018. The fair value of the collateral pledged must be maintained at certain specified levels above the borrowed amount, which can vary depending on the assets pledged. If the fair value of the collateral declines below these specified levels of the amount borrowed, United Insurance would be required to pledge additional collateral or repay outstanding borrowings. Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018 includes $10.0 million related to these advances. There were no advances from the FHLB of Dallas outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nThere were no advances from the FHLB of Chicago or the FHLB of Dallas outstanding at December 31, 2017.\nSubsidiary Dividends and Capital Contributions\nVarious state insurance laws restrict the ability of Kemper's insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends without regulatory approval. Such insurance laws generally restrict the amount of dividends paid in an annual period to the greater of statutory net income from the previous year or 10% of statutory capital and surplus. Kemper's direct insurance subsidiaries paid dividends of $130.4 million, $108.1 million and $104.5 million to Kemper in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2019, Kemper estimates that its direct insurance subsidiaries would be able to pay $351 million in dividends to Kemper without prior regulatory approval.\nIn 2018, to fund growth initiatives and meet capital requirements, Kemper made a capital contribution of $20.0 million to its subsidiary, Alliance United Insurance Company.\nAcquisition of Infinity\nOn July 2, 2018, Kemper acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Infinity, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement dated February 13, 2018, with total cash, stock and equity-based compensation consideration paid to Infinity shareholders of approximately $1.5 billion. In conjunction with closing the acquisition, Kemper issued 13,184,107 shares, with an aggregate fair value of $982.5 million based on Kemper's July 2, 2018 stock price of $74.53, and paid $564.6 million in cash consideration to Infinity's shareholders. In addition, Kemper issued 44,010 restricted units under Kemper's equity-based compensation plan to replace Infinity restricted shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the closing. The aggregate fair value of such Kemper restricted units granted was $3.3 million at July 2, 2018, of which $1.6 million is attributed to service provided prior to the closing and included in consideration paid. The remaining amount of $1.7 million is attributed to future service and will be recognized in compensation expense primarily over a period of two years. The cash consideration was funded by cash on hand as of July 2, 2018, inclusive of $250.0 million in borrowings under the Company's delayed draw term loan facility and $110.0 million of Kemper subsidiary borrowings from the FHLB of Dallas and FHLB of Chicago. On July 13, 2018, Kemper subsidiaries repaid in full the $110.0 million of FHLB borrowings, plus accrued interest. On December 28, 2018, Kemper repaid $215.0 million of the delayed draw term loan facility.

Infinity is a national provider of auto insurance focused on serving the specialty automobile market. With approximately 10,600 independent agents and $1.4 billion in 2017 direct written premiums, Infinity is one of the largest nonstandard auto insurers in the United States.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Continued)\nCommon Stock Repurchases and Dividends to Shareholders\nOn August 6, 2014, the Board of Directors approved the 2014 Repurchase Program under which Kemper is authorized to repurchase up to $300 million of its common stock and terminated Kemper's remaining authorization under the 2011 Repurchase Program.\nDuring 2018 and 2017, Kemper did not repurchase any shares of its common stock. During 2016, Kemper repurchased approximately 0.1 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $3.8 million in open market transactions under the 2014 Repurchase Program. The Company had $243.7 million of remaining capacity under the 2014 Repurchase Program at December 31, 2018.\nKemper paid a quarterly dividend to shareholders of $0.24 per common share in each quarter of 2018 and 2017. Dividends paid were $56.4 million and $49.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nSources and Uses of Funds\nKemper directly held cash and investments totaling $100.6 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $197.3 million at December 31, 2017. Sources available for the repayment of indebtedness, repurchases of common stock, future shareholder dividend payments, additional capitalization of its direct insurance subsidiaries, and the payment of interest on Kemper's senior notes and subordinated debentures include cash and investments directly held by Kemper, receipt of dividends from Kemper's subsidiaries and borrowings under the credit agreement.\nThe primary sources of funds for Kemper's insurance subsidiaries are premiums, investment income and proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments, advances from the FHLBs of Dallas and Chicago, and capital contributions from Kemper. The primary uses of funds are the payment of policyholder benefits under life insurance contracts, claims and claims-related expenses under property and casualty insurance contracts and accident and health insurance contracts, the payment of commissions and general expenses, the purchase of investments, repayments of advances from the FHLBs of Dallas and Chicago and payment of dividends to Kemper. Generally, there is a time lag between when premiums are collected and when policyholder benefits and insurance claims are paid.\nIn the third quarter of 2016, the Company's Life & Health segment voluntarily began implementing a comprehensive process under which it cross-references its life insurance policies against the DMF and other death verification databases to identify potential instances where the beneficiaries may not have filed a claim following the death of an insured and initiate an outreach process to identify and contact beneficiaries and settle claims.\nDuring periods of growth, insurance companies typically experience positive operating cash flows and are able to invest a portion of their operating cash flows to fund future policyholder benefits and claims. During periods in which premium revenues decline, insurance companies may experience negative cash flows from operations and may need to sell investments to fund payments to policyholders and claimants. In addition, if the Company's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries experience several significant catastrophic events over a relatively short period of time, investments may have to be sold in advance of their maturity dates to fund payments, which could result in either investment gains or losses. Management believes that its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries maintain adequate levels of liquidity in the event that they were to experience several future catastrophic events over a relatively short period of time.\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities increased by $298.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities increased by $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016.\nNet Cash Used by Financing Activities was $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $205.2 million for the same period in 2017. Net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, which was used to fund the acquisition of Infinity, provided $249.4 million of cash for the year ended December 31, 2018. Kemper used $215.0 million of cash to repay long-term debt for the year ended December 31, 2018. Kemper did not use any cash during 2018 or 2017 to repurchase shares of its common stock. Kemper used $56.4 million of cash to pay dividends for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $49.5 million of cash used to pay dividends in the same period of 2017. The quarterly dividend rate was $0.24 per common share for each quarter of 2018 and 2017.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Continued)\nNet Cash Used by Financing Activities was $205.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $48.4 million for the same period in 2016. Kemper used $360.0 million of cash to repay long-term debt for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt provided $200.2 million of cash for the year ended December 31, 2017. Kemper did not use any cash during 2017 to repurchase shares of its common stock, compared to $3.8 million of cash to repurchase shares of its common stock in 2016. Kemper used $49.5 million of cash to pay dividends for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $49.2 million in 2016. The quarterly dividend rate was $0.24 per common share for each quarter of 2017 and 2016.\nCash available for investment activities in total is dependent on cash flow from Operating Activities and Financing Activities and the level of cash the Company elects to maintain. Net Cash Used by Investing Activities was $497.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $105.4 million in 2017. Net cash provided by dispositions of short-term investments was $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $39.4 million in 2017. Fixed Maturities investing activities used net cash of $230.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $181.9 million in 2017. Equity Securities investing activities used net cash of $126.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $0.7 million in 2017. Equity Method Limited Liability Investments investing activities used net cash of $29.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to providing net cash of $20.2 million in 2017. As of January 1, 2018, with the adoption of new accounting guidance, the Company's historical Fair Value Option Investments are now carried as Equity Securities at Fair Value or Equity Securities at Modified Cost. Accordingly, no activity was recorded for Fair Value Option Investments for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared net cash provided by Fair Value Option Investing Activities of $35.2 million in 2017.\nNet Cash Used by Investing Activities was $105.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $238.1 million in 2016. Net cash provided by dispositions of short-term investments was $39.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net cash used by acquisitions of short-term investments of $18.0 million in 2016. Fixed Maturities investing activities used net cash of $181.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $318.0 million in 2016. Equity Securities investing activities used net cash of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to providing net cash of $68.8 million in 2016. Equity Method Limited Liability Investments investing activities provided net cash of $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $6.4 million in 2016. Net cash provided by Fair Value Option Investments investing activities was $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $51.2 million in 2016. The Company did not use cash to purchase Corporate-owned Life Insurance during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to purchases of $7.5 million in 2016.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Company has no material obligations under guarantee contracts. The Company has no material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. The Company has no material obligations, including contingent obligations, under contracts that would be accounted for as derivative instruments. The Company has no obligations, including contingent obligations, arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity held by, and material to, the Company, where such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the Company. Accordingly, the Company has no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nEstimated cash disbursements pertaining to the Company's contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 are presented below.

Such cash outflows are based on the Company's current assumptions for mortality, morbidity and policy lapse, but are undiscounted with respect to interest. Policies must remain in force for the policyholder or beneficiary to receive the benefit under the policy. Depending on the terms of a particular policy, future premiums from the policyholder may be required for the policy to remain in force. The Company estimates that future cash inflows would total $3.8 billion using the same assumptions used to estimate the cash outflows. The Company's Life Insurance Reserves in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets are generally based on the historical assumptions for mortality and policy lapse rates and are on a discounted basis. Accordingly, the sum of the amounts presented above for Life and Health Insurance Policy Benefits significantly exceeds the amount of Life and Health Insurance Reserves reported on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018.\nIn addition to the purchase obligations included above, the Company had certain investment commitments totaling $275.4 million at December 31, 2018. The funding of such investment commitments is dependent on a number of factors, the timing of which is indeterminate. The contractual obligations reported above also exclude the Company's liability of $4.4 million for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments, if any, for such liability. Other Contractual Obligations Reflected in Long Term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under GAAP primarily consist of interest obligations related to Long Term Debt Obligations.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nKemper's subsidiaries conduct their businesses in two industries: property and casualty insurance and life and health insurance. Accordingly, the Company is subject to several industry-specific accounting principles under GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The process of estimation is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results could ultimately differ materially from the estimated amounts reported in a company's financial statements. Different assumptions are likely to result in different estimates of reported amounts. The Company's critical accounting policies most sensitive to estimates include the valuation of investments, the valuation of property and casualty insurance reserves for losses and LAE, the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and the valuation of pension benefit obligations.\nValuation of Investments\nThe reported value of the Company's investments was $8,069.5 million at December 31, 2018, of which $7,140.1 million, or 88%, was reported at fair value, $187.0 million, or 2%, was reported under the equity method of accounting, $300.6 million, or 4%, was reported at unpaid principal balance and $441.8 million, or 6%, was reported at cost, modified cost or depreciated cost. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate risk, credit risk and overall market volatility risk. Accordingly, it is reasonably possible that changes in the fair values of the Company's investments reported at fair value will occur in the near term and such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Also, it is reasonably possible that changes in the carrying values of the Company's Equity Method Limited Liability Investments will occur in the near term and such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the financial statements because these issuers follow specialized industry accounting rules which require that they report all of their investments at fair value (See Item 1A., Risk Factors\u201d under the title The Company's investment portfolio is exposed to a variety of risks that may negatively impact net investment income and cause realized and unrealized losses\u201d).\nAs more fully described under the heading, Fair Value Measurements,\u201d in Note 2, Summary of Accounting Policies and Accounting Changes,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses a hierarchical framework which prioritizes and ranks the market observability used in fair value measurements.\nThe fair value of the Company's investments measured and reported at fair value was $7,140.1 million at December 31, 2018, of which $6,050.7 million, or 85%, were investments that were based on quoted market prices or significant value drivers that are observable, $897.4 million, or 13%, were investments where at least one significant value driver was unobservable and $192.0 million or 3% were investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Fair value measurements based on readily available, active, quoted market prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally are deemed to have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment, compared to fair value measurements based on significant unobservable inputs used in measuring fair value. The\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)\nprices that the Company might realize from actual sales of investments are likely to vary from their respective estimated fair values at December 31, 2018 due to changing market conditions and limitations inherent in the estimation process.\nThe classification of a company's investment in a financial instrument may affect its reported results. Under GAAP, a company may elect to use the fair value option method of accounting for some or all of its investments in financial instruments. Under the fair value option method of accounting, a company is required to recognize changes in fair values into income for the period reported. The Company has elected the fair value option for investments in fixed maturities with equity conversion features which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Convertible Securities. Accordingly, both the reported and fair values of the Company's investments in Convertible Securities accounted for under the fair value option method of accounting were $31.5 million at December 31, 2018. For investments in fixed maturities classified as held to maturity, a company is required to carry the investment at amortized cost, with only amortization occurring during the period recognized into income. None of the Company's investments in fixed maturities were classified as held to maturity at December 31, 2018. Changes in the fair value of investments in fixed maturities classified as available for sale are not recognized in income during the period, but rather are recognized as a separate component of AOCI until realized. Both the reported and fair values of the Company's investments in fixed maturities classified as available for sale were $6,424.2 million at December 31, 2018.\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values are recorded as Equity Securities at Fair Value with changes in fair values recognized into income for the period reported. Accordingly, both the reported and fair values of the Company's investments in Equity Securities at Fair Value were $684.4 million at December 31, 2018. The Company holds certain equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments from the same issuer. Changes in the carrying value of Equity Securities at Modified Cost due to observable price changes are recorded into income for the period reported.\nHad the Company elected the fair value option for all of its investments in financial instruments, the Company's reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2018, would have decreased by $174.9 million.\nThe Company regularly reviews its fixed maturity investment portfolio and holdings in Equity Securities at Modified Cost for factors that may indicate that a decline in the fair value of an investment below its cost, amortized cost or modified cost basis is other than temporary. Such reviews are inherently uncertain in that the value of the investment may not fully recover or may decline further in future periods. Some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value of an investment is other than temporary include, but are not limited to, the following:\nFixed Maturity Securities\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The financial condition, credit rating and prospects of the issuer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The length of time and magnitude of the unrealized loss;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The ability of the issuer to make scheduled principal and interest payments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The volatility of the investment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Equity Securities at Modified Cost\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Opinions of the Company's external investment managers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The financial condition and prospects of the issuer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Current market conditions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in credit ratings; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in the regulatory environment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nChanges in these factors from their December 31, 2018 evaluation date could result in the Company determining that a temporary decline in the fair value of an investment held and evaluated at December 31, 2018 is no longer temporary at a subsequent evaluation date. Such determination would result in an impairment loss recognized in earnings in the period such determination is made.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nThe Company's Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves are reported using the Company's estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and LAE for claims that occurred prior to the end of any given accounting period but have not yet been paid.

Accordingly, the process of estimating and establishing the Company's Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves is inherently uncertain, and the actual ultimate cost of known and unknown claims may vary materially from the estimated amounts reserved.\nThe Company's actuaries generally estimate reserves at least quarterly for most product lines and/or coverage levels using accident quarters or years spanning 10 or more years, depending on the product line and/or coverage level or emerging issues relating to them. The Company's actuaries use a variety of generally accepted actuarial loss reserving estimation methodologies, including, but not limited to, the following:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Incurred Loss Development Methodology;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Paid Loss Development Methodology;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Bornhuetter-Ferguson Incurred Loss Methodology;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Bornhuetter-Ferguson Paid Loss Methodology; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Frequency and Severity Methodology.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The Company's actuaries generally review the results of at least four of the estimation methodologies, two based on paid data and two based on incurred data, to initially estimate the ultimate losses and LAE for the current accident quarter or year and re-estimate the ultimate losses and LAE for previous accident quarters or years to determine if changes in the previous estimates of the ultimate losses and LAE are indicated by the most recent data. In some cases, the methodologies produce a cluster of estimates with a tight band of indicated possible outcomes. In other cases, however, the methodologies produce conflicting results and wider bands of indicated possible outcomes, and the Company's actuaries perform additional analyses before making their final selections. However, such bands do not necessarily constitute a range of outcomes, nor does the Company's management or the Company's actuaries calculate a range of outcomes.\nThe key assumption in these estimation methodologies is that patterns observed in prior periods are indicative of how losses and LAE are expected to develop in the future and that such historical data can be used to predict and estimate ultimate losses and LAE. However, changes in the Company's business processes, by their very nature, are likely to affect the development patterns, which means the Company's actuaries must routinely evaluate the applicability of historical data in future projections. The ultimate impact of a single change in a business process is difficult to quantify and detect, and even more difficult if several changes to business processes occur over several years. Initially after a change is implemented, there are fewer data points, as compared to the historical data, for the Company's actuaries to analyze. With fewer data points to analyze, the Company's actuaries cannot be certain that observed differences from the historical data trends are a result of the change in business process or merely a random fluctuation in the data. As the Company's actuaries observe more data points following the change in business process, the Company's actuaries can gain more confidence in whether the change in business process is affecting the development pattern. The challenge for the Company's actuaries is how much weight to place on the development patterns based on the older historical data and how much weight to place on the development patterns based on more recent data.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)\nAt a minimum, the Company's actuaries analyze 70 product and/or coverage levels for either 40 accident quarters or 10 accident years for both losses and LAE using many of the loss reserving estimation methodologies identified above as well as other generally accepted actuarial estimation methodologies. In all, there are more than 10,000 combinations of accident quarters or years, coverage levels, and generally accepted actuarial estimation methodologies used to estimate the Company's unpaid losses and LAE. In some cases, the Company's actuaries make adjustments to the loss reserving estimation methodologies identified above or use additional generally accepted actuarial estimation methodologies to estimate ultimate losses and LAE.\nFor each accident quarter or year, the point estimate selected by the Company's actuaries is not necessarily one of the points produced by any particular one of the methodologies utilized, but often is another point selected by the Company's actuaries, using their professional judgment, that takes into consideration each of the points produced by the several loss reserving estimation methodologies used. In some cases, for a particular product, the current accident quarter or year may not have enough paid claims data to rely upon, leading the Company's actuaries to conclude that the incurred loss development methodology provides a better estimate than the paid loss development methodology. Therefore, the Company's actuaries may give more weight to the incurred loss development methodology for that particular accident quarter or year. As an accident quarter or year ages for that same product, the actuary may gain more confidence in the paid loss development methodology and begin to give more weight to the paid loss development methodology. The Company's actuaries' quarterly selections are summed by product and/or coverage levels to create the actuarial indication of the ultimate losses. More often than not, the actuarial indication for a particular product line and accident quarter is most heavily weighted toward the incurred loss development methodology, particularly for short-tail lines such as personal automobile insurance. Historically, the incurred loss development methodology has been more reliable in predicting ultimate losses for short-tail lines, especially in the more recent accident quarters or years, compared with the paid loss development methodology. However, in some circumstances changes can occur which impact numerous variables, including, but not limited to, those variables identified below that are difficult to quantify and/or impact the predictive value of prior development patterns relied upon in the incurred loss development methodology and paid loss development methodology. In those circumstances, the Company's actuaries must make adjustments to these loss reserving estimation methodologies or use additional generally accepted actuarial estimation methodologies. In those circumstances, the Company's actuaries, using their professional judgment, may place more weight on the adjusted loss reserving estimation methodologies or other generally accepted actuarial estimation methodologies until the newer development patterns fully emerge and the Company's actuaries can fully rely on the unadjusted loss reserving estimation methodologies. In the event of a wide variation among results generated by the different projection methodologies, the Company's actuaries further analyze the data using additional techniques.\nIn estimating reserves, the Company's actuaries exercise professional judgment and must consider, and are influenced by, many variables that are difficult to quantify, such as:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in the level of minimum case reserves, and the automatic aging of those minimum case reserves;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes to claims practices, including, but not limited to, changes in the reporting and impact of large losses, timing of reported claims, changes in claims closing and re-opening patterns, adequacy of case reserves, implementation of new systems for handling claims, turnover of claims department staffs, timing and depth of the audit review of claims handling procedures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in underwriting practices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in the mix of business by state, class and policy limit within product line;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Growth in new lines of business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in the attachment points of the Company's reinsurance programs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Medical costs, including, but not limited to, the ability to assess the extent of injuries and the impact of inflation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Repair costs, including, but not limited to, the impact of inflation and the availability of labor and materials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in the judicial environment, including, but not limited to, the interpretation of policy provisions, the impact of jury awards and changes in case law; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in state regulatory requirements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> A change in any one or more of the foregoing factors is likely to result in a projected ultimate net loss and LAE that is different from the previously estimated reserve and/or previous frequency and severity trends. Such changes in estimates may be material.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)\nFor example, the Company's actuaries review frequency (number of claims per policy or exposure), severity (dollars of loss per claim) and average premium (dollars of premium per exposure). Actual frequency and severity experienced will vary depending on changes in mix by class of insured risk. Similarly, the actual frequency and rate of recovery from reinsurance will vary depending on changes in the attachment point for reinsurance. In particular, in periods of high growth or expansion into new markets, there may be additional uncertainty in estimating the ultimate losses and LAE. The contributing factors of this potential risk are changes in the Company's mix by policy limit and mix of business by state or jurisdiction.\nActuaries use historical experience and trends as predictors of how losses and LAE will emerge over time. However, historical experience may not necessarily be indicative of how actual losses and LAE will emerge. Changes in case reserve adequacy, changes in minimum case reserves and changes in internal claims handling procedures could impact the timing and recognition of incurred claims and produce an estimate that is either too high or too low if not adjusted for by the actuary. For example, if, due to changes in claims handling procedures, actual claims are settled more rapidly than they were settled historically, the estimate produced by the paid loss development methodology would tend to be overstated if the actuary did not identify and adjust for the impact of the changes in claims handling procedures. Similarly, if, due to changes in claims handling procedures, actual claim reserves are set at levels higher than past experience, the estimate produced by the incurred loss development methodology would tend to be overstated if the actuary did not identify and adjust for the impact of the changes in claims handling procedures.\nThe final step in the quarterly loss and LAE reserving process involves a comprehensive review of the actuarial indications by the Company's corporate actuary and corporate management who apply their collective judgment and determine the appropriate estimated level of reserves to record. Numerous factors are considered in this determination process, including, but not limited to, the assessed reliability of key loss trends and assumptions that may be significantly influencing the current actuarial indications, changes in claim handling practices or other changes that affect the timing of payment or development patterns, changes in the mix of business, the maturity of the accident quarter or year, pertinent trends observed over the recent past, the level of volatility within a particular line of business, the improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications in the current period as compared to prior periods, and the amount of reserves related to third party pools for which the Company does not have access to the underlying data and, accordingly, relies on calculations provided by such pools.\nEstimated Variability of Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves\nThe Company's goal is to ensure that its total reserves for property and casualty insurance losses and LAE are adequate to cover all costs, while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves for losses and LAE are initially estimated until losses and LAE are fully developed. Changes in the Company's estimates of these losses and LAE over time, also referred to as development,\u201d will occur and may be material. Favorable development is recognized and reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements when the Company decreases its previous estimate of ultimate losses and LAE and results in an increase in net income in the period recognized, whereas adverse development is recognized and reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements when the Company increases its previous estimate of ultimate losses and LAE and results in a decrease in net income.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)\nDevelopment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, was:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DOLLARS IN MILLIONS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable (Adverse) Development\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Continuing Operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred Personal Automobile Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Homeowners Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Personal Lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty Personal Automobile Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Automobile Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life & Health Insurance:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Favorable (Adverse) Development from Continuing Operations, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discontinued Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Favorable (Adverse) Development, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee MD&A, Loss and LAE Reserve Development,\u201d Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d and Life & Health Insurance,\u201d for further information on development reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAlthough development will emerge in all of the Company's product lines, development in the Company's specialty personal automobile insurance product line could have the most significant impact due to the relative size of its loss and LAE reserves. To further illustrate the sensitivity of the Company's reserves for specialty personal automobile insurance losses and LAE, the Company measures the standard deviation of the mean reserve estimate using a bootstrapping methodology. The Company believes that one standard deviation of variability is a reasonably likely scenario to measure variability for its loss and LAE reserves for specialty personal automobile insurance. The Company estimates that the Company's specialty personal automobile insurance loss and LAE reserves could have varied by $59.1 million in either direction at December 31, 2018 for all accident years combined under this scenario. In addition to the factors described above, other factors may also impact loss reserve development in future periods. These factors include governmental actions, including court decisions interpreting existing laws, regulations or policy provisions, developments related to insurance policy claims and coverage issues, adverse or favorable outcomes in pending claims litigation, the number and severity of insurance claims, the impact of inflation on insurance claims and the impact of required participation in windpools and joint underwriting associations and residual market assessments. Although the Company's actuaries do not make specific numerical assumptions about these factors, changes in these factors from past patterns will impact historical loss development factors and, in turn, future loss reserve development. Significant favorable changes in one or more factors will lead to favorable future loss reserve development, which could result in the actual loss developing closer to, or even below, the lower end of the Company's estimated reserve variability. Significant unfavorable changes in one or more factors will lead to unfavorable loss reserve development, which could result in the actual loss developing closer to, or even above, the higher end of the Company's estimated reserve variability. Accordingly, due to these factors and the other factors enumerated throughout the MD&A and the inherent limitations of the loss reserving estimation methodologies, the estimated and illustrated reserve variability may not necessarily be indicative of the Company's future reserve variability, which could ultimately be greater than the estimated and illustrated variability. In addition, as previously noted, development will emerge in all of the Company's product lines over time. Accordingly, the Company's future reserve variability could ultimately be greater than the illustrated variability. Additional information pertaining to the estimation of, and development of, the Company's Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves is contained in Item 1 of Part I of this 2018 Annual Report under the heading Property and Casualty Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves.\u201d\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)\nGoodwill Recoverability\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. In 2018, the Company changed the date on which it performs the annual goodwill impairment test from January 1 to October 1, moving the test date closer to year-end. Accordingly, the Company performed two goodwill impairment tests in 2018, the first as of January 1, 2018 and the second as of October 1, 2018. The Company performed qualitative goodwill impairment assessments on both dates for all reporting units with goodwill. The qualitative assessment takes into consideration changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in management or key personnel, changes in strategy and changes in our stock price since the last quantitative assessment, which was performed on January 1, 2017. For each reporting unit tested, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit, and the Company concluded that the associated goodwill was recoverable.\nPension Benefit Obligations\nThe process of estimating the Company's pension benefit obligations and pension benefit costs is inherently uncertain and the actual cost of benefits may vary materially from the estimates recorded. These liabilities are particularly volatile due to their long-term nature and are based on several assumptions. The main assumptions used in the valuation of the Company's pension benefit obligations and pension costs are:\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Estimated mortality of the participants and beneficiaries eligible for benefits;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Estimated expected long-term rates of returns on investments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Estimated rate used to discount the expected benefit payment to a present value.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> A change in any one or more of these assumptions is likely to result in a projected benefit obligation or pension cost that differs from the actuarial estimates at December 31, 2018. Such changes in estimates may be material. For example, a one-percentage point decrease in the Company's estimated discount rate would increase the pension benefit obligation at December 31, 2018 by $75.9 million, while a one-percentage point increase in the rate would decrease the pension benefit obligation at December 31, 2018 by $62.8 million. A one-percentage point decrease in the Company's estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase the pension expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 by $5.4 million, while a one-percentage point increase in the rate would decrease pension expense by $5.4 million for the same period.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nExcept for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered standards, the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) is the sole source of authoritative GAAP recognized by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) that is applicable to the Company.

increased by $69.2 million in 2018, compared to 2017. In the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment, segment net operating results increased by $71.1 million due primarily to lower catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) and the favorable impact of loss and LAE reserve development, partially offset by higher insurance expenses as a percentage of earned premiums. See MD&A, Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 33 for additional discussion of the segment's results. In the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment, segment net operating results increased by $59.5 million due primarily to the impact of lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums on a higher level of earned premiums, higher net investment income and lower levels of adverse loss and LAE reserve development, partially offset by the impact of higher insurance expenses as a percentage of earned premiums on a higher level of earned premiums and driven by the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments associated with Kemper's acquisition of Infinity.

In the Life & Health Insurance segment, segment net operating income decreased by $0.4 million due primarily to higher policyholders' benefits and incurred losses and LAE and lower net investment income, almost entirely offset by lower income tax expense due to the lower corporate income tax rate in 2018. See MD&A, Life & Health Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 45 for additional discussion of the segment's results. Additionally, the Company's results were impacted in 2018, compared to 2017, by transaction and integration costs associated with Kemper's acquisition of Infinity and a loss from the change in the fair value of the Company's equity security portfolio, for which such changes are recorded through the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2018, compared to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, in 2017, partially offset by the positive effects of tax law changes and the partial satisfaction of a legal judgment.

In the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment, segment net operating results deteriorated by $61.0 million due primarily to higher incurred catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) and an unfavorable change in loss and LAE reserve development, partially offset by higher net investment income. See MD&A, Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 33 for additional discussion of the segment's results. In the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment, segment net operating results increased by $70.8 million due primarily to lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums, lower insurance expenses as a percentage of earned premiums and higher net investment income. See MD&A, Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 40 for additional discussion of the segment's results. In the Life & Health Insurance segment, segment net operating income increased by $60.9 million due primarily to a $50.5 million after-tax charge in 2016 to recognize the impact of using death verification databases in the Company's operations, including to determine its IBNR liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses for life insurance products. See MD&A, Life & Health Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 45 for additional discussion of the segment's results. The Company's results were also positively impacted in 2017, compared to 2016, by higher net realized gains on sales of investments, lower impairment losses recognized in earnings and a lower unallocated net operating loss, due primarily to an income tax benefit of $7.4 million to recognize the effects of changes in the federal income tax law. See MD&A, Investment Results,\u201d beginning on page 50 and MD&A, Income Taxes,\u201d beginning on page 57 for additional information.\nRevenues\n2018 Compared with 2017\nEarned Premiums were $3,384.4 million in 2018, compared to $2,350.0 million in 2017, an increase of $1,034.4 million driven primarily by growth in Kemper's legacy specialty personal automobile insurance and the acquisition of Infinity. Earned Premiums increased by $1,021.7 million, $0.4 million and $12.3 million in the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment, Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance Segment and Life & Health Insurance segment, respectively.

Net Investment Income from Alternative Investments, which consist of Equity Method Limited Liability Investments, Fair Value Option Investments and other limited liability investments included in Equity Securities at Fair Value or Equity Securities at Modified Cost, decreased by $17.3 million. Alternative investment income from Equity Method Limited Liability Investments decreased by $13.8 million. Alternative investment income from limited liability investments included in either Equity Securities at Fair Value or Equity Securities at Modified Cost decreased by $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017. No Net Investment Income was recorded on Fair Value Option Investments for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1.3 million for the same period in 2017. See MD&A, Investment Results,\u201d under the sub-caption Net Investment Income\u201d beginning on page 50 for additional discussion.\nOther Income increased by $38.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, due primarily to the the partial satisfaction of a final judgment against Computer Sciences Corporation ( CSC\u201d).

The Company cannot make any assurance as to the additional amounts of the final judgment that will actually be collected or when they may be received. The unpaid balance of the final judgment is treated as a gain contingency for accounting purposes and accordingly, is not recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, in 2018. As a result of adoption, beginning in 2018, changes in the fair value of the Company's investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Loss from Change in Fair Value of Equity and Convertible Securities recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $64.3 million in 2018. Prior to 2018, changes in the fair value of equity securities were recognized in other comprehensive income.

Net Investment Income from Alternative Investments, which consist of Equity Method Limited Liability Investments, Fair Value Option Investments and other limited liability investments included in Equity Securities, increased by $27.1 million. Alternative investment income from Equity Method Limited Liability Investments, other limited liability investments included in Equity Securities, and Fair Value Option Investments increased by $17.3 million, $6.6 million and $3.2 million, respectively, in 2017, compared to 2016.

The Company cannot predict when or if similar investment gains or losses may occur in the future.\nCATASTROPHES\nCatastrophes and natural disasters are inherent risks of the property and casualty insurance business. These catastrophic events and natural disasters include, without limitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, hailstorms, wildfires, high winds and winter storms. Such events result in insured losses that are, and will continue to be, a material factor in the results of operations and financial position of the Company's property and casualty insurance companies. Further, because the level of these insured losses occurring in any one year cannot be accurately predicted, these losses may contribute to material year-to-year fluctuations in the results of operations and financial position of these companies. Specific types of catastrophic events are more likely to occur at certain times within the year than others. This factor adds an element of seasonality to property and casualty insurance claims. The Company has adopted the industry-wide catastrophe classifications of storms and other events promulgated by ISO to track and report losses related to catastrophes. ISO classifies a disaster as a catastrophe when the event causes $25.0 million or more in direct insured losses to property and affects a significant number of policyholders and insurers. ISO-classified catastrophes are assigned a unique serial number recognized throughout the insurance industry.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCATASTROPHES (Continued)\nThe number of ISO-classified catastrophic events and catastrophe losses and LAE, net of reinsurance recoveries, (excluding loss and LAE reserve development) by range of loss and business segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are presented below.

Coverage under the catastrophe reinsurance program is provided in various contracts and layers. The Company's Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance and Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segments also purchase reinsurance from the FHCF for hurricane losses in Florida at retentions lower than its catastrophe reinsurance program. The Life & Health Insurance segment also purchases reinsurance from the FHCF for hurricane losses in Florida. Except for the coverage provided by the FHCF, the Life & Health Insurance segment does not carry any other catastrophe reinsurance coverage.\nIn 2018 and 2017, the Company had catastrophe reinsurance recoveries of $31.8 million and $11.9 million under its catastrophe reinsurance programs, respectively. Catastrophe recoveries under the FHCF were not material in 2018 or 2017. In 2018 and 2017, the Company paid $0.4 million and $0.8 million in reinstatement premium, respectively. The Company did not pay any reinstatement premium in 2016.\nSee the Reinsurance\u201d subsection of the Property and Casualty Insurance Business\u201d and Life and Health Insurance Business\u201d sections of Item 1(c), Description of Business,\u201d and Note 20, Catastrophe Reinsurance,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's reinsurance programs.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nLOSS AND LAE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT\nIncreases (decreases) in the Company's property and casualty loss and LAE reserves for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 to recognize adverse (favorable) loss and LAE reserve development from prior accident years in continuing operations, hereinafter also referred to as reserve development\u201d in the discussion of segment results, are presented below.

See MD&A, Critical Accounting Estimates,\u201d of this 2018 Annual Report for additional information pertaining to the Company's process of estimating property and casualty insurance reserves for losses and LAE, and the estimated variability thereof, development of property and casualty insurance losses and LAE, and a discussion of some of the variables that may impact them.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nPursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, the Company is required to file consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The Company is permitted to include non-GAAP financial measures in its filings provided that they are defined along with an explanation of their usefulness to investors, are no more prominent than the comparable GAAP financial measures and are reconciled to such GAAP financial measures.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for the comparable GAAP financial measures, as they do not fully recognize the overall profitability of the Company's businesses.\nUnderlying Combined Ratio\nThe following discussions of segment results use the non-GAAP financial measures of (i) Underlying Losses and LAE and (ii) Underlying Combined Ratio. Underlying Losses and LAE (also referred to in the discussion as Current Year Non-catastrophe Losses and LAE\u201d) exclude the impact of catastrophe losses and loss and LAE reserve development from prior years from the Company's Incurred Losses and LAE, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Underlying Combined Ratio is computed by adding the Current Year Non-catastrophe Losses and LAE Ratio with the Insurance Expense Ratio. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is the Combined Ratio, which is computed by adding total incurred losses and LAE, including the impact of catastrophe losses and loss and LAE reserve development from prior years, with the Insurance Expense Ratio. The Company believes Underlying Losses and LAE and the Underlying Combined Ratio are useful to investors and are used by management to reveal the trends in the Company's Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance and Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance businesses that may be obscured by catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development. These catastrophe losses may cause the Company's loss trends to vary significantly between\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nperiods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on incurred losses and LAE and the combined ratio. Prior-year reserve developments are caused by unexpected loss development on historical reserves. Because reserve development relates to the re-estimation of losses from earlier years, it has no bearing on the performance of the Company's insurance products that were in force in the current period. The Company believes it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's underwriting performance.\nAdjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income\nAdjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income is an after-tax, non-GAAP financial measure and is computed by excluding from Income from Continuing Operations the after-tax impact of:\n1) Income (Loss) from Change in Fair Value of Equity and Convertible Securities;\n2) Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments;\n3) Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings related to investments;\n4) Acquisition Related Transaction, Integration and Other Costs;\n5) Loss from Early Extinguishment of Debt; and\n6) Significant non-recurring or infrequent items that may not be indicative of ongoing operations.\nSignificant non-recurring items are excluded when (a) the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years, and (b) there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is Income from Continuing Operations. There were no applicable significant non-recurring items that the Company excluded from the calculation of Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016.\nThe Company believes that Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income provides investors with a valuable measure of its ongoing performance because it reveals underlying operational performance trends that otherwise might be less apparent if the items were not excluded. Income (Loss) from Change in Fair Value of Equity and Convertible Securities, Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments and Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings related to investments included in the Company's results may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and external economic developments such as capital market conditions that impact the values of the Company's investments, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Acquisition Related Transaction, Integration and Other Costs may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by the timing of acquisitions and business decisions which are unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Loss from Early Extinguishment of Debt is driven by the Company's financing and refinancing decisions and capital needs, as well as external economic developments such as debt market conditions, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Significant non-recurring items are excluded because, by their nature, they are not indicative of the Company's business or economic trends.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nPREFERRED PROPERTY & CASUALTY INSURANCE\nSelected financial information for the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment is presented below.

caption Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\u201d beginning on page 64 for additional information pertaining to the Company's process of estimating property and casualty insurance reserves for losses and LAE, development of property and casualty insurance losses and LAE from prior accident years, also referred to as reserve development\u201d in the discussion of segment results, estimated variability of property and casualty insurance reserves for losses and LAE, and a discussion of some of the variables that may impact development of property and casualty insurance losses and LAE and the estimated variability of property and casualty insurance reserves for losses and LAE.\nOverall\n2018 Compared with 2017\nThe Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment reported Segment Net Operating Income of $25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to Segment Net Operating Loss of $45.4 million in 2017. Segment net operating results improved by $71.1 million due primarily to lower current year catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding loss and LAE reserve development) and the favorable impact of loss and LAE reserve development, partially offset by higher insurance expense as a percentage of earned premiums.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nPREFERRED PROPERTY & CASUALTY INSURANCE (Continued)\nEarned Premiums in the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment increased by $0.4 million in 2018, compared to 2017, as higher average earned premium accounted for an increase of $21.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in volume of $21.0 million. All product lines experienced an increase in average earned premium, although the overall impact on Earned Premiums was driven primarily by preferred personal automobile insurance, which had increases due to higher average earned premium of $19.5 million. The lower volume was driven by homeowners insurance and preferred personal automobile insurance which had volume decreases of $15.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively.\nNet Investment Income in the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment increased by $2.9 million in 2018, compared to 2017, due primarily to higher levels of fixed maturity investments and higher income from fixed maturity investments, partially offset by lower income from Alternative Investments. The Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment reported Net Investment Income from Alternative Investments of $18.6 million 2018, compared to $22.5 million in 2017.\nUnderlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were 62.9% in both 2018 and 2017. Underlying incurred losses and LAE exclude the impact of catastrophes and loss and LAE reserve development. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $87.3 million in 2018, compared to $173.5 million in 2017, which is a decrease of $86.2 million due primarily to lower losses on California wildfires in 2018, compared 2017, due in part to reinsurance recoveries in 2018 under the aggregate property catastrophe reinsurance contract and fewer catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) from events with greater than $20.0 million in losses and LAE. Favorable loss and LAE reserve development (including catastrophe reserve development) was $8.3 million in 2018, compared to adverse development of $15.7 million in 2017. Adverse development in 2017 was driven primarily by preferred personal automobile insurance.\nInsurance expenses were $225.5 million, or 30.9% of earned premiums, in 2018, an increase of 1.1 percentage points compared to 2017, driven primarily by increased ceded premiums in 2018 under the Company's aggregate property catastrophe reinsurance contract.\nThe Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment's effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions. Tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions were $8.5 million in 2018, compared to $13.9 million in 2017.\n2017 Compared with 2016\nThe Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment reported Segment Net Operating Loss of $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to Segment Net Operating Income of $15.6 million in 2016. Segment net operating results deteriorated by $61.0 million due primarily to higher incurred catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) and an unfavorable change in loss and LAE reserve development, partially offset by higher net investment income and cost containment measures.\nEarned premiums in the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment decreased by $11.2 million in 2017, compared to 2016 as lower volume accounted for a decrease of $32.6 million, while higher average earned premium accounted for an increase of $21.4 million. The lower volume was driven primarily by preferred personal automobile insurance and homeowners insurance, which had volume decreases of $16.6 million and $13.2 million, respectively.\nNet Investment Income in the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment increased by $10.3 million in 2017, compared to 2016, due primarily to higher investment income from Alternative Investments, and to a lesser extent, higher levels of non-alternative investments. The Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment reported Net Investment Income from Alternative Investments of $22.5 million in 2017, compared to $12.6 million in 2016.\nUnderlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were 62.9% in 2017, an increase of 0.1% percentage points, compared to 2016, driven primarily by increases in preferred automobile insurance, partially offset by decreases in homeowners insurance. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $173.5 million in 2017, compared to $103.1 million in 2016, which is an increase of $70.4 million due primarily to California wildfires and higher average severity on catastrophic events with losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) of less than $15.0 million in 2017, compared to 2016. This increase was partially offset by two large catastrophes, both Texas hailstorms, occurring in 2016, with aggregated estimated losses and LAE of $61.9 million, compared to one such Texas hailstorm, occurring in 2017, with estimated losses and LAE of $43.9 million. Adverse loss and LAE reserve development (including catastrophe reserve development) was $15.7 million in 2017, compared to favorable development of $23.4 million in 2016. Adverse development in 2017 was driven primarily by preferred automobile insurance.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nPREFERRED PROPERTY & CASUALTY INSURANCE (Continued)\nInsurance expenses were $217.8 million, or 29.8% of earned premiums, in 2017, an improvement of 1.1 percentage points compared to 2016, driven primarily by cost reduction initiatives and an increase in the percentage of software development costs eligible for capitalization.\nThe Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment's effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions. Tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions were $13.9 million in 2017, compared to $13.7 million in 2016.\nPreferred Personal Automobile Insurance\nSelected financial information for the preferred personal automobile insurance product line is presented below.

The decrease in earned premium attributed to lower volume was primarily due to the run-off of the direct-to-consumer business. Incurred losses and LAE were $310.2 million, or 70.5% of earned premiums, in 2018, compared to $339.6 million, or 80.3% of earned premiums, in 2017. Incurred losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums decreased due primarily to a favorable change in loss and LAE reserve development, lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of related earned premiums and lower catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development). Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of related earned premiums were 70.2% in 2018, compared to 73.0% in 2017, which was an improvement of 2.8 percentage points due primarily to lower frequency of claims and higher average earned premiums, partially offset by higher severity of losses, particularly on bodily injury coverages. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $7.2 million in 2018, compared to $11.3 million in 2017. Favorable loss and LAE reserve development was $5.8 million in 2018, compared to adverse development of $19.3 million in 2017.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nPREFERRED PROPERTY & CASUALTY INSURANCE (Continued)\n2017 Compared with 2016\nEarned premiums in preferred personal automobile insurance decreased by $1.8 million in 2017, compared to 2016, as lower volume accounted for a decrease of $16.6 million, while higher average earned premium accounted for an increase of $14.8 million. The run-off of the direct-to-consumer business accounted for approximately 60% of the decrease in earned premiums attributed to lower volume. Incurred losses and LAE were $339.6 million, or 80.3% of earned premiums, in 2017, compared to $324.2 million, or 76.4% of earned premiums, in 2016. Incurred losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums increased due primarily to a higher level of adverse loss and LAE reserve development and higher underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of related earned premiums. Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of related earned premiums were 73.0% in 2017, compared to 72.6% in 2016, which was a deterioration of 0.4 percentage points due primarily to higher severity of losses, particularly on bodily injury coverages, partially offset by lower frequency of claims on most coverages, particularly bodily injury. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $11.3 million in 2017, compared to $11.6 million in 2016, both periods experiencing higher losses than average due primarily to Hurricane Harvey in 2017, and hailstorms in Texas in 2017 and 2016.

Incurred losses and LAE were $209.9 million, or 83.9% of earned premiums, in 2018, compared to $287.8 million, or 108.7% of earned premiums, in 2017. Incurred losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums decreased due to reinsurance recoveries from the Company's 2018 catastrophe aggregate reinsurance program, partially offset by an unfavorable change in loss and LAE reserve development and higher underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums. Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were 52.5% in 2018, compared to 48.9% in 2017, a deterioration of 3.6 percentage points due primarily to higher severity of losses, and to a lesser extent, higher frequency of claims, partially offset by higher average earned premium. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $75.2 million in 2018, compared to $157.3 million in 2017. This decrease was driven primarily by fewer catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) from events with greater than $20.0 million in losses and LAE and reinsurance recoveries under the Company's 2018 aggregate property catastrophe reinsurance program. Loss and LAE reserve development was adverse by $3.2 million in 2018, compared to $1.0 million in 2017.\n2017 Compared with 2016\nEarned premiums in homeowners insurance decreased by $7.1 million in 2017, compared to 2016, as lower volume accounted for a decrease of $13.2 million, while higher average earned premium accounted for an increase of $6.1 million. Incurred losses and LAE were $287.8 million, or 108.7% of earned premiums, in 2017, compared to $204.5 million, or 75.2% of earned premiums, in 2016. Incurred losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums increased due to higher incurred catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) and an unfavorable change in loss and LAE reserve development, partially offset by lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums. Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were 48.9% in 2017, compared to 49.9% in 2016, which was an improvement of 1.0 percentage points due primarily to lower frequency of claims, partially offset by higher severity of losses. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $157.3 million in 2017, compared to $89.0 million in 2016. This increase was driven primarily by California wildfires, with estimated losses and LAE of $53.3 million, and higher average severity on catastrophic events in 2017 with losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) of less than $15 million, compared to 2016, partially offset by the impact of the aggregate losses and LAE from the two aforementioned Texas hailstorms that occurred in 2016 exceeding the losses and LAE from the aforementioned Texas hailstorm that occurred in March of 2017.

The results of its operations have been included in the preceding tables of selected financial information for the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment from the date of its acquisition and forward. Infinity is a national provider of auto insurance focused on serving the specialty, nonstandard segment. With approximately 10,600 independent agents and $1.4 billion in 2017 direct written premiums, Infinity is one of the largest specialty auto insurers in the United States.\nOverall\n2018 Compared with 2017\nThe Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment reported Segment Net Operating Income of $115.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $56.3 million in 2017. Segment net operating results improved by $59.5 million due primarily to the impact of lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums on a higher level of earned premiums, particularly in the Company's specialty personal automobile insurance business, higher net investment income and lower levels of adverse loss and LAE reserve development, partially offset by the impact of higher insurance expenses as a percentage of earned premiums on a higher level of earned premiums and driven by the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments associated with Kemper's acquisition of Infinity.\nEarned Premiums in the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment increased by $1,021.7 million in 2018, compared to 2017. Infinity accounted for $758.1 million of the increase while higher volume and higher average earned premium on Kemper's legacy business accounted for increases of $198.9 million and $64.7 million, respectively. Both of Kemper's legacy product lines experienced an increase in average earned premium, although the overall impact on Earned Premiums was driven primarily by specialty personal automobile insurance which had increases due to higher average earned premium of $61.9 million. Kemper's legacy's higher volume was driven by specialty personal automobile insurance, which had a volume increase of $202.9 million, partially offset primarily by a volume decrease in commercial automobile insurance of $4.0 million.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nSPECIALTY PROPERTY & CASUALTY INSURANCE (Continued)\nNet Investment Income in the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment increased by $24.2 million in 2018, compared to 2017, due primarily to higher levels of investments due in large part to growth in Kemper's legacy specialty automobile insurance business and the acquisition of Infinity, partially offset by lower income from Alternative Investments. The Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment reported Net Investment Income from Alternative Investments of $19.1 million in 2018, compared to $14.9 million in 2017.\nUnderlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were 74.9% in 2018, a decrease of 3.8 percentage points, compared to 2017, driven by both specialty personal automobile insurance and commercial automobile insurance product lines, particularly in the Infinity business which historically had lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums. Underlying losses and LAE exclude the impact of catastrophes and loss and LAE reserve development. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $4.7 million in 2018, compared to $5.5 million in 2017, which is a decrease of $0.8 million. Adverse loss and LAE reserve development (including catastrophe reserve development) was $1.7 million in 2018, compared to $3.8 million in 2017.\nInsurance expenses were $421.7 million, or 20.8% of earned premiums, in 2018, an increase of 4.4 percentage points, compared to 2017, driven primarily by the amortization of Infinity purchase accounting adjustments.\nThe Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment's effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions. Tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions were $11.5 million in 2018, compared to $11.7 million in 2017.\n2017 Compared with 2016\nThe Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment reported Segment Net Operating Income of $56.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to Segment Net Operating Loss of $14.5 million in 2016. Segment net operating results improved by $70.8 million due primarily to lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums, in both the specialty automobile and commercial automobile product lines, lower insurance expenses as a percentage of earned premiums, higher net investment income from Alternative Investments and lower levels of adverse loss and LAE reserve development.\nEarned Premiums in the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment increased by $132.4 million in 2017, compared to 2016, as higher average earned premium and higher volume accounted for increases of $81.9 million and $50.5 million, respectively. The increase in average earned premium was driven by both the specialty automobile and commercial automobile product lines, with increases in average earned premium of $77.7 million and $4.2 million, respectively. The higher volume was driven by specialty automobile insurance, which had a volume increase of $56.6 million, partially offset by a volume decrease in commercial automobile insurance of $6.1 million.\nNet Investment Income in the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment increased by $10.1 million in 2017, compared to 2016, due primarily to higher investment income from Alternative Investments, and to a lesser extent, higher levels of non-alternative investments. The Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment reported Net Investment Income from Alternative Investments of $14.9 million in 2017, compared to $7.6 million in 2016.\nUnderlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were 78.7% in 2017, a decrease of 8.1% percentage points, compared to 2016, driven primarily by improvements in specialty automobile insurance. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $5.5 million in 2017, compared to $6.5 million in 2016. Adverse loss and LAE reserve development (including catastrophe reserve development) was $3.8 million in 2017, compared to $9.1 million in 2016.\nInsurance expenses were $165.0 million, or 16.4% of earned premiums, in 2017, an improvement of 1.5 percentage points compared to 2016, driven primarily by earned premium growth outpacing variable costs.\nThe Specialty Property & Casualty insurance segment's effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions. Tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions were $11.7 million in 2017, compared to $10.0 million in 2016.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nSPECIALTY PROPERTY & CASUALTY INSURANCE (Continued)\nSpecialty Personal Automobile Insurance\nSelected financial information for the specialty personal automobile insurance product line for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 is presented below.\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DOLLARS IN MILLIONS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Premiums Written\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,927.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>992.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>832.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earned Premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,889.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>954.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>820.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incurred Losses and LAE related to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current Year:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-catastrophe Losses and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,418.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>750.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>714.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Catastrophe Losses and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior Years:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-catastrophe Losses and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Catastrophe Losses and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Incurred Losses and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,427.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>758.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>726.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratios Based On Earned Premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current Year Non-catastrophe Losses and LAE Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current Year Catastrophe Losses and LAE Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior Years Non-catastrophe Losses and LAE Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior Years Catastrophe Losses and LAE Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Incurred Loss and LAE Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 Compared with 2017\nEarned Premiums on specialty personal automobile insurance increased by $935.2 million in 2018, compared to 2017.

Insurance Expenses decreased by $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016, due primarily to growth in business, partially offset by lower amortization of insurance in force.\nInterest and Other Expenses\nInterest expense increased by $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017, due primarily to higher levels of debt outstanding to facilitate the funding of the acquisition of Infinity. Interest expense decreased by $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016, due primarily to lower levels of debt outstanding and a lower average effective interest rate thereon. See MD&A, Liquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d and Note 7, Debt,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of debt activity.\nOther Expenses increased by $69.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017, due primarily to the acquisition of Infinity, the inclusion of acquisition related transaction, integration and other costs and higher employee compensation. Other Expenses decreased by $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016, due primarily to lower pension expense in 2017 resulting from the full-year effect of freezing benefit accruals under the Company's defined benefit pension plans and a longer amortization period to amortize actuarial losses, as discussed in Note 16 Pension Benefits\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, partially offset by net curtailment gains recognized in 2016, higher employee compensation and a charge to earnings in 2017 to record the ineffective portion of a hedging relationship related to the Company's debt issuance.\nINCOME TAXES\nOn December 22, 2017, Public Law 115-97, more commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), was enacted. The Tax Act includes numerous changes to existing federal income tax law, including a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. In 2017, pursuant to Staff Accounting Bulletin\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nINCOME TAXES (Continued)\nNo. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d), the Company recorded certain provisional amounts for the estimated income tax effects of the Tax Act on deferred income taxes.\nIn 2018, the Company finalized its determination of the effects of the Tax Act on deferred income taxes based on information received from third parties, completion of actuarial tax computations that impacted the amount of deductions related to reserves reportable for federal income tax purposes for tax years prior to 2018, and other items. As a result, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 in connection with the finalization of the tax effects, which was primarily attributable to the effect of the updated actuarial tax computations.\nThe Company's effective income tax rate from continuing operations differs from the Federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to (1) the Tax Act, (2) the effects of tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions, (3) certain indemnification recoveries recognized in earnings that result in an adjustment in the tax purchase price and are excluded from the determination of taxable income, and (4) the net effects of state income taxes.\nThe tax benefit recorded pursuant to the Tax Act was $26.4 million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions were $22.4 million, $28.0 million and $28.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Estimated indemnification recoveries recognized in earnings result in an adjustment in the tax purchase price and are excluded from the determination of taxable income and income tax expense. Such recoveries were $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. State income tax expense, net of federal benefit, from continuing operations was $0.1 million and $0.6 million in 2018 and 2016, respectively. State income tax benefit, net of federal expense, from continuing operations was $0.1 million in 2017. See Note 15, Income Taxes,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of income taxes.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAmended and Extended Credit Agreement and Term Loan Facility\nOn June 8, 2018, the Company entered into an amended and extended credit agreement and term loan facility. The amended and extended credit agreement increased the borrowing capacity of the existing unsecured credit agreement to $300.0 million and extended the maturity date to June 8, 2023. The term loan facility includes a delayed draw feature with borrowing capacity of $250.0 million and a maturity date two years from the borrowing date. Furthermore, the amended and extended credit agreement provides for an accordion feature whereby the Company can increase either the revolving credit or term loan borrowing capacity by $100.0 million. On June 29, 2018, the Company borrowed $250.0 million on the delayed draw term loan facility to facilitate the funding of the acquisition of Infinity. The proceeds from the term loan facility, net of debt issuance costs, were $249.4 million. On December 28, 2018, the Company repaid $215.0 million of the outstanding term loan. There were no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017 under the revolving credit agreement.\nInfinity Debt\nInfinity's liabilities at the acquisition date included $275.0 million principal amount, 5.0% Senior Notes due September 19, 2022 (the 2022 Infinity Senior Notes\u201d). The 2022 Senior Notes were recorded at a fair value of $282.1 million as of the acquisition date, with the $7.1 million premium being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term, resulting in an effective interest rate of 4.4%. On November 30, 2018 Kemper executed a guarantee to fully and unconditionally guarantee the payment and performance obligations of the 2022 Infinity Senior Notes.\nLong-term Debt\nThe Company has $450.0 million of 4.35% senior notes due February 15, 2025 (the 2025 Senior Notes\u201d) outstanding as of December 31, 2018. The Company initially issued $250.0 million of the 2025 Senior Notes in February of 2015. In June of 2017, Kemper issued an additional $200 million of the 2025 Senior Notes. The proceeds of the additional issuance were $200.2 million, net of discount and transaction costs, for an effective yield of 4.16%. The additional notes are fungible with the initial notes issued in 2015, and together are treated as part of a single series for all purposes under the indenture governing the 2025 Senior Notes. Kemper used the net proceeds from the additional issuance for general corporate purposes. The 2025 Senior Notes are unsecured and may be redeemed in whole at any time or in part from time to time at Kemper's option at specified redemption prices.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Continued)\nShort-term Debt\nKemper's subsidiaries, United Insurance and Trinity Universal Insurance Company ( Trinity\u201d), are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) of Chicago and Dallas, respectively. As a requirement of membership in the FHLB, United Insurance and Trinity maintain a certain level of investment in FHLB stock. Total holdings of FHLB of Chicago stock were $0.8 million and $0.4 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Total holdings of FHLB of Dallas stock were $3.3 million at both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nIn June of 2018, United Insurance received advances of $55.0 million from the FHLB of Chicago and Trinity received advances of $55.0 million from the FHLB of Dallas. The advances, which were repaid in full on July 13, 2018, were made to facilitate the funding of the acquisition of Infinity.\nIn March of 2018, United Insurance received advances of $10.0 million from the FHLB of Chicago. The advances, which mature in one year or less, were made in connection with the start-up of the Company's collateralized investment borrowing program. In connection with the advances, United Insurance pledged U.S. Government Agency securities with a fair value of $15.7 million at December 31, 2018. The fair value of the collateral pledged must be maintained at certain specified levels above the borrowed amount, which can vary depending on the assets pledged. If the fair value of the collateral declines below these specified levels of the amount borrowed, United Insurance would be required to pledge additional collateral or repay outstanding borrowings. Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018 includes $10.0 million related to these advances. There were no advances from the FHLB of Dallas outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nThere were no advances from the FHLB of Chicago or the FHLB of Dallas outstanding at December 31, 2017.\nSubsidiary Dividends and Capital Contributions\nVarious state insurance laws restrict the ability of Kemper's insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends without regulatory approval. Such insurance laws generally restrict the amount of dividends paid in an annual period to the greater of statutory net income from the previous year or 10% of statutory capital and surplus. Kemper's direct insurance subsidiaries paid dividends of $130.4 million, $108.1 million and $104.5 million to Kemper in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2019, Kemper estimates that its direct insurance subsidiaries would be able to pay $351 million in dividends to Kemper without prior regulatory approval.\nIn 2018, to fund growth initiatives and meet capital requirements, Kemper made a capital contribution of $20.0 million to its subsidiary, Alliance United Insurance Company.\nAcquisition of Infinity\nOn July 2, 2018, Kemper acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Infinity, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement dated February 13, 2018, with total cash, stock and equity-based compensation consideration paid to Infinity shareholders of approximately $1.5 billion. In conjunction with closing the acquisition, Kemper issued 13,184,107 shares, with an aggregate fair value of $982.5 million based on Kemper's July 2, 2018 stock price of $74.53, and paid $564.6 million in cash consideration to Infinity's shareholders. In addition, Kemper issued 44,010 restricted units under Kemper's equity-based compensation plan to replace Infinity restricted shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the closing. The aggregate fair value of such Kemper restricted units granted was $3.3 million at July 2, 2018, of which $1.6 million is attributed to service provided prior to the closing and included in consideration paid. The remaining amount of $1.7 million is attributed to future service and will be recognized in compensation expense primarily over a period of two years. The cash consideration was funded by cash on hand as of July 2, 2018, inclusive of $250.0 million in borrowings under the Company's delayed draw term loan facility and $110.0 million of Kemper subsidiary borrowings from the FHLB of Dallas and FHLB of Chicago. On July 13, 2018, Kemper subsidiaries repaid in full the $110.0 million of FHLB borrowings, plus accrued interest. On December 28, 2018, Kemper repaid $215.0 million of the delayed draw term loan facility. See Note 3, Acquisition of Business,\u201d and Note 7, Debt,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Infinity is a national provider of auto insurance focused on serving the specialty automobile market. With approximately 10,600 independent agents and $1.4 billion in 2017 direct written premiums, Infinity is one of the largest nonstandard auto insurers in the United States.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Continued)\nCommon Stock Repurchases and Dividends to Shareholders\nOn August 6, 2014, the Board of Directors approved the 2014 Repurchase Program under which Kemper is authorized to repurchase up to $300 million of its common stock and terminated Kemper's remaining authorization under the 2011 Repurchase Program.\nDuring 2018 and 2017, Kemper did not repurchase any shares of its common stock. During 2016, Kemper repurchased approximately 0.1 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $3.8 million in open market transactions under the 2014 Repurchase Program. The Company had $243.7 million of remaining capacity under the 2014 Repurchase Program at December 31, 2018.\nKemper paid a quarterly dividend to shareholders of $0.24 per common share in each quarter of 2018 and 2017. Dividends paid were $56.4 million and $49.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nSources and Uses of Funds\nKemper directly held cash and investments totaling $100.6 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $197.3 million at December 31, 2017. Sources available for the repayment of indebtedness, repurchases of common stock, future shareholder dividend payments, additional capitalization of its direct insurance subsidiaries, and the payment of interest on Kemper's senior notes and subordinated debentures include cash and investments directly held by Kemper, receipt of dividends from Kemper's subsidiaries and borrowings under the credit agreement.\nThe primary sources of funds for Kemper's insurance subsidiaries are premiums, investment income and proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments, advances from the FHLBs of Dallas and Chicago, and capital contributions from Kemper. The primary uses of funds are the payment of policyholder benefits under life insurance contracts, claims and claims-related expenses under property and casualty insurance contracts and accident and health insurance contracts, the payment of commissions and general expenses, the purchase of investments, repayments of advances from the FHLBs of Dallas and Chicago and payment of dividends to Kemper. Generally, there is a time lag between when premiums are collected and when policyholder benefits and insurance claims are paid.\nIn the third quarter of 2016, the Company's Life & Health segment voluntarily began implementing a comprehensive process under which it cross-references its life insurance policies against the DMF and other death verification databases to identify potential instances where the beneficiaries may not have filed a claim following the death of an insured and initiate an outreach process to identify and contact beneficiaries and settle claims.\nDuring periods of growth, insurance companies typically experience positive operating cash flows and are able to invest a portion of their operating cash flows to fund future policyholder benefits and claims. During periods in which premium revenues decline, insurance companies may experience negative cash flows from operations and may need to sell investments to fund payments to policyholders and claimants. In addition, if the Company's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries experience several significant catastrophic events over a relatively short period of time, investments may have to be sold in advance of their maturity dates to fund payments, which could result in either investment gains or losses. Management believes that its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries maintain adequate levels of liquidity in the event that they were to experience several future catastrophic events over a relatively short period of time.\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities increased by $298.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities increased by $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016.\nNet Cash Used by Financing Activities was $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $205.2 million for the same period in 2017. Net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, which was used to fund the acquisition of Infinity, provided $249.4 million of cash for the year ended December 31, 2018. Kemper used $215.0 million of cash to repay long-term debt for the year ended December 31, 2018. Kemper did not use any cash during 2018 or 2017 to repurchase shares of its common stock. Kemper used $56.4 million of cash to pay dividends for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $49.5 million of cash used to pay dividends in the same period of 2017. The quarterly dividend rate was $0.24 per common share for each quarter of 2018 and 2017.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Continued)\nNet Cash Used by Financing Activities was $205.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $48.4 million for the same period in 2016. Kemper used $360.0 million of cash to repay long-term debt for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt provided $200.2 million of cash for the year ended December 31, 2017. Kemper did not use any cash during 2017 to repurchase shares of its common stock, compared to $3.8 million of cash to repurchase shares of its common stock in 2016. Kemper used $49.5 million of cash to pay dividends for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $49.2 million in 2016. The quarterly dividend rate was $0.24 per common share for each quarter of 2017 and 2016.\nCash available for investment activities in total is dependent on cash flow from Operating Activities and Financing Activities and the level of cash the Company elects to maintain.

The Company has no material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. The Company has no material obligations, including contingent obligations, under contracts that would be accounted for as derivative instruments. The Company has no obligations, including contingent obligations, arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity held by, and material to, the Company, where such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the Company. Accordingly, the Company has no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nEstimated cash disbursements pertaining to the Company's contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 are presented below.

Such cash outflows are based on the Company's current assumptions for mortality, morbidity and policy lapse, but are undiscounted with respect to interest. Policies must remain in force for the policyholder or beneficiary to receive the benefit under the policy. Depending on the terms of a particular policy, future premiums from the policyholder may be required for the policy to remain in force. The Company estimates that future cash inflows would total $3.8 billion using the same assumptions used to estimate the cash outflows. The Company's Life Insurance Reserves in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets are generally based on the historical assumptions for mortality and policy lapse rates and are on a discounted basis. Accordingly, the sum of the amounts presented above for Life and Health Insurance Policy Benefits significantly exceeds the amount of Life and Health Insurance Reserves reported on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018.\nIn addition to the purchase obligations included above, the Company had certain investment commitments totaling $275.4 million at December 31, 2018. The funding of such investment commitments is dependent on a number of factors, the timing of which is indeterminate. The contractual obligations reported above also exclude the Company's liability of $4.4 million for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments, if any, for such liability. Other Contractual Obligations Reflected in Long Term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under GAAP primarily consist of interest obligations related to Long Term Debt Obligations.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nKemper's subsidiaries conduct their businesses in two industries: property and casualty insurance and life and health insurance. Accordingly, the Company is subject to several industry-specific accounting principles under GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The process of estimation is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results could ultimately differ materially from the estimated amounts reported in a company's financial statements. Different assumptions are likely to result in different estimates of reported amounts. The Company's critical accounting policies most sensitive to estimates include the valuation of investments, the valuation of property and casualty insurance reserves for losses and LAE, the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and the valuation of pension benefit obligations.\nValuation of Investments\nThe reported value of the Company's investments was $8,069.5 million at December 31, 2018, of which $7,140.1 million, or 88%, was reported at fair value, $187.0 million, or 2%, was reported under the equity method of accounting, $300.6 million, or 4%, was reported at unpaid principal balance and $441.8 million, or 6%, was reported at cost, modified cost or depreciated cost. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate risk, credit risk and overall market volatility risk. Accordingly, it is reasonably possible that changes in the fair values of the Company's investments reported at fair value will occur in the near term and such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Also, it is reasonably possible that changes in the carrying values of the Company's Equity Method Limited Liability Investments will occur in the near term and such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the financial statements because these issuers follow specialized industry accounting rules which require that they report all of their investments at fair value (See Item 1A., Risk Factors\u201d under the title The Company's investment portfolio is exposed to a variety of risks that may negatively impact net investment income and cause realized and unrealized losses\u201d).\nAs more fully described under the heading, Fair Value Measurements,\u201d in Note 2, Summary of Accounting Policies and Accounting Changes,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses a hierarchical framework which prioritizes and ranks the market observability used in fair value measurements.\nThe fair value of the Company's investments measured and reported at fair value was $7,140.1 million at December 31, 2018, of which $6,050.7 million, or 85%, were investments that were based on quoted market prices or significant value drivers that are observable, $897.4 million, or 13%, were investments where at least one significant value driver was unobservable and $192.0 million or 3% were investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Fair value measurements based on readily available, active, quoted market prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally are deemed to have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment, compared to fair value measurements based on significant unobservable inputs used in measuring fair value. The\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)\nprices that the Company might realize from actual sales of investments are likely to vary from their respective estimated fair values at December 31, 2018 due to changing market conditions and limitations inherent in the estimation process.\nThe classification of a company's investment in a financial instrument may affect its reported results. Under GAAP, a company may elect to use the fair value option method of accounting for some or all of its investments in financial instruments. Under the fair value option method of accounting, a company is required to recognize changes in fair values into income for the period reported. The Company has elected the fair value option for investments in fixed maturities with equity conversion features which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Convertible Securities. Accordingly, both the reported and fair values of the Company's investments in Convertible Securities accounted for under the fair value option method of accounting were $31.5 million at December 31, 2018. For investments in fixed maturities classified as held to maturity, a company is required to carry the investment at amortized cost, with only amortization occurring during the period recognized into income. None of the Company's investments in fixed maturities were classified as held to maturity at December 31, 2018. Changes in the fair value of investments in fixed maturities classified as available for sale are not recognized in income during the period, but rather are recognized as a separate component of AOCI until realized. Both the reported and fair values of the Company's investments in fixed maturities classified as available for sale were $6,424.2 million at December 31, 2018.\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values are recorded as Equity Securities at Fair Value with changes in fair values recognized into income for the period reported. Accordingly, both the reported and fair values of the Company's investments in Equity Securities at Fair Value were $684.4 million at December 31, 2018. The Company holds certain equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments from the same issuer. Changes in the carrying value of Equity Securities at Modified Cost due to observable price changes are recorded into income for the period reported.\nHad the Company elected the fair value option for all of its investments in financial instruments, the Company's reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2018, would have decreased by $174.9 million.\nThe Company regularly reviews its fixed maturity investment portfolio and holdings in Equity Securities at Modified Cost for factors that may indicate that a decline in the fair value of an investment below its cost, amortized cost or modified cost basis is other than temporary. Such reviews are inherently uncertain in that the value of the investment may not fully recover or may decline further in future periods. Some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value of an investment is other than temporary include, but are not limited to, the following:\nFixed Maturity Securities\n \u2022 The financial condition, credit rating and prospects of the issuer; \n \u2022 The length of time and magnitude of the unrealized loss; \n \u2022 The ability of the issuer to make scheduled principal and interest payments; \n \u2022 The volatility of the investment;  Equity Securities at Modified Cost\n \u2022 Opinions of the Company's external investment managers; \n \u2022 The financial condition and prospects of the issuer; \n \u2022 Current market conditions; \n \u2022 Changes in credit ratings; and \n \u2022 Changes in the regulatory environment. \nChanges in these factors from their December 31, 2018 evaluation date could result in the Company determining that a temporary decline in the fair value of an investment held and evaluated at December 31, 2018 is no longer temporary at a subsequent evaluation date. Such determination would result in an impairment loss recognized in earnings in the period such determination is made.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nThe Company's Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves are reported using the Company's estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and LAE for claims that occurred prior to the end of any given accounting period but have not yet been paid. The Company had $1,874.9 million and $1,016.8 million of gross loss and LAE reserves at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Reserves for the Company's business segments at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were: Table 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DOLLARS IN MILLIONS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business Segments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>452.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>461.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,387.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>514.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life & Health Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Business Segments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,844.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>980.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discontinued Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,874.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,016.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn estimating the Company's Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves, the Company's actuaries exercise professional judgment and must consider, and are influenced by, many variables that are difficult to quantify. Accordingly, the process of estimating and establishing the Company's Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves is inherently uncertain, and the actual ultimate cost of known and unknown claims may vary materially from the estimated amounts reserved.\nThe Company's actuaries generally estimate reserves at least quarterly for most product lines and/or coverage levels using accident quarters or years spanning 10 or more years, depending on the product line and/or coverage level or emerging issues relating to them. The Company's actuaries use a variety of generally accepted actuarial loss reserving estimation methodologies, including, but not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 Incurred Loss Development Methodology; \n \u2022 Paid Loss Development Methodology; \n \u2022 Bornhuetter-Ferguson Incurred Loss Methodology; \n \u2022 Bornhuetter-Ferguson Paid Loss Methodology; and \n \u2022 Frequency and Severity Methodology.  The Company's actuaries generally review the results of at least four of the estimation methodologies, two based on paid data and two based on incurred data, to initially estimate the ultimate losses and LAE for the current accident quarter or year and re-estimate the ultimate losses and LAE for previous accident quarters or years to determine if changes in the previous estimates of the ultimate losses and LAE are indicated by the most recent data. In some cases, the methodologies produce a cluster of estimates with a tight band of indicated possible outcomes. In other cases, however, the methodologies produce conflicting results and wider bands of indicated possible outcomes, and the Company's actuaries perform additional analyses before making their final selections. However, such bands do not necessarily constitute a range of outcomes, nor does the Company's management or the Company's actuaries calculate a range of outcomes.\nThe key assumption in these estimation methodologies is that patterns observed in prior periods are indicative of how losses and LAE are expected to develop in the future and that such historical data can be used to predict and estimate ultimate losses and LAE. However, changes in the Company's business processes, by their very nature, are likely to affect the development patterns, which means the Company's actuaries must routinely evaluate the applicability of historical data in future projections. The ultimate impact of a single change in a business process is difficult to quantify and detect, and even more difficult if several changes to business processes occur over several years. Initially after a change is implemented, there are fewer data points, as compared to the historical data, for the Company's actuaries to analyze. With fewer data points to analyze, the Company's actuaries cannot be certain that observed differences from the historical data trends are a result of the change in business process or merely a random fluctuation in the data. As the Company's actuaries observe more data points following the change in business process, the Company's actuaries can gain more confidence in whether the change in business process is affecting the development pattern. The challenge for the Company's actuaries is how much weight to place on the development patterns based on the older historical data and how much weight to place on the development patterns based on more recent data.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)\nAt a minimum, the Company's actuaries analyze 70 product and/or coverage levels for either 40 accident quarters or 10 accident years for both losses and LAE using many of the loss reserving estimation methodologies identified above as well as other generally accepted actuarial estimation methodologies. In all, there are more than 10,000 combinations of accident quarters or years, coverage levels, and generally accepted actuarial estimation methodologies used to estimate the Company's unpaid losses and LAE. In some cases, the Company's actuaries make adjustments to the loss reserving estimation methodologies identified above or use additional generally accepted actuarial estimation methodologies to estimate ultimate losses and LAE.\nFor each accident quarter or year, the point estimate selected by the Company's actuaries is not necessarily one of the points produced by any particular one of the methodologies utilized, but often is another point selected by the Company's actuaries, using their professional judgment, that takes into consideration each of the points produced by the several loss reserving estimation methodologies used. In some cases, for a particular product, the current accident quarter or year may not have enough paid claims data to rely upon, leading the Company's actuaries to conclude that the incurred loss development methodology provides a better estimate than the paid loss development methodology. Therefore, the Company's actuaries may give more weight to the incurred loss development methodology for that particular accident quarter or year. As an accident quarter or year ages for that same product, the actuary may gain more confidence in the paid loss development methodology and begin to give more weight to the paid loss development methodology. The Company's actuaries' quarterly selections are summed by product and/or coverage levels to create the actuarial indication of the ultimate losses. More often than not, the actuarial indication for a particular product line and accident quarter is most heavily weighted toward the incurred loss development methodology, particularly for short-tail lines such as personal automobile insurance. Historically, the incurred loss development methodology has been more reliable in predicting ultimate losses for short-tail lines, especially in the more recent accident quarters or years, compared with the paid loss development methodology. However, in some circumstances changes can occur which impact numerous variables, including, but not limited to, those variables identified below that are difficult to quantify and/or impact the predictive value of prior development patterns relied upon in the incurred loss development methodology and paid loss development methodology. In those circumstances, the Company's actuaries must make adjustments to these loss reserving estimation methodologies or use additional generally accepted actuarial estimation methodologies. In those circumstances, the Company's actuaries, using their professional judgment, may place more weight on the adjusted loss reserving estimation methodologies or other generally accepted actuarial estimation methodologies until the newer development patterns fully emerge and the Company's actuaries can fully rely on the unadjusted loss reserving estimation methodologies. In the event of a wide variation among results generated by the different projection methodologies, the Company's actuaries further analyze the data using additional techniques.\nIn estimating reserves, the Company's actuaries exercise professional judgment and must consider, and are influenced by, many variables that are difficult to quantify, such as:\n \u2022 Changes in the level of minimum case reserves, and the automatic aging of those minimum case reserves; \n \u2022 Changes to claims practices, including, but not limited to, changes in the reporting and impact of large losses, timing of reported claims, changes in claims closing and re-opening patterns, adequacy of case reserves, implementation of new systems for handling claims, turnover of claims department staffs, timing and depth of the audit review of claims handling procedures; \n \u2022 Changes in underwriting practices; \n \u2022 Changes in the mix of business by state, class and policy limit within product line; \n \u2022 Growth in new lines of business; \n \u2022 Changes in the attachment points of the Company's reinsurance programs; \n \u2022 Medical costs, including, but not limited to, the ability to assess the extent of injuries and the impact of inflation; \n \u2022 Repair costs, including, but not limited to, the impact of inflation and the availability of labor and materials; \n \u2022 Changes in the judicial environment, including, but not limited to, the interpretation of policy provisions, the impact of jury awards and changes in case law; and \n \u2022 Changes in state regulatory requirements.  A change in any one or more of the foregoing factors is likely to result in a projected ultimate net loss and LAE that is different from the previously estimated reserve and/or previous frequency and severity trends. Such changes in estimates may be material.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)\nFor example, the Company's actuaries review frequency (number of claims per policy or exposure), severity (dollars of loss per claim) and average premium (dollars of premium per exposure). Actual frequency and severity experienced will vary depending on changes in mix by class of insured risk. Similarly, the actual frequency and rate of recovery from reinsurance will vary depending on changes in the attachment point for reinsurance. In particular, in periods of high growth or expansion into new markets, there may be additional uncertainty in estimating the ultimate losses and LAE. The contributing factors of this potential risk are changes in the Company's mix by policy limit and mix of business by state or jurisdiction.\nActuaries use historical experience and trends as predictors of how losses and LAE will emerge over time. However, historical experience may not necessarily be indicative of how actual losses and LAE will emerge. Changes in case reserve adequacy, changes in minimum case reserves and changes in internal claims handling procedures could impact the timing and recognition of incurred claims and produce an estimate that is either too high or too low if not adjusted for by the actuary. For example, if, due to changes in claims handling procedures, actual claims are settled more rapidly than they were settled historically, the estimate produced by the paid loss development methodology would tend to be overstated if the actuary did not identify and adjust for the impact of the changes in claims handling procedures. Similarly, if, due to changes in claims handling procedures, actual claim reserves are set at levels higher than past experience, the estimate produced by the incurred loss development methodology would tend to be overstated if the actuary did not identify and adjust for the impact of the changes in claims handling procedures.\nThe final step in the quarterly loss and LAE reserving process involves a comprehensive review of the actuarial indications by the Company's corporate actuary and corporate management who apply their collective judgment and determine the appropriate estimated level of reserves to record. Numerous factors are considered in this determination process, including, but not limited to, the assessed reliability of key loss trends and assumptions that may be significantly influencing the current actuarial indications, changes in claim handling practices or other changes that affect the timing of payment or development patterns, changes in the mix of business, the maturity of the accident quarter or year, pertinent trends observed over the recent past, the level of volatility within a particular line of business, the improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications in the current period as compared to prior periods, and the amount of reserves related to third party pools for which the Company does not have access to the underlying data and, accordingly, relies on calculations provided by such pools.\nEstimated Variability of Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves\nThe Company's goal is to ensure that its total reserves for property and casualty insurance losses and LAE are adequate to cover all costs, while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves for losses and LAE are initially estimated until losses and LAE are fully developed. Changes in the Company's estimates of these losses and LAE over time, also referred to as development,\u201d will occur and may be material. Favorable development is recognized and reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements when the Company decreases its previous estimate of ultimate losses and LAE and results in an increase in net income in the period recognized, whereas adverse development is recognized and reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements when the Company increases its previous estimate of ultimate losses and LAE and results in a decrease in net income.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)\nDevelopment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, was:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DOLLARS IN MILLIONS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable (Adverse) Development\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Continuing Operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred Personal Automobile Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Homeowners Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Personal Lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty Personal Automobile Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Automobile Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life & Health Insurance:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Favorable (Adverse) Development from Continuing Operations, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discontinued Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Favorable (Adverse) Development, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee MD&A, Loss and LAE Reserve Development,\u201d Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d and Life & Health Insurance,\u201d for further information on development reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAlthough development will emerge in all of the Company's product lines, development in the Company's specialty personal automobile insurance product line could have the most significant impact due to the relative size of its loss and LAE reserves. To further illustrate the sensitivity of the Company's reserves for specialty personal automobile insurance losses and LAE, the Company measures the standard deviation of the mean reserve estimate using a bootstrapping methodology. The Company believes that one standard deviation of variability is a reasonably likely scenario to measure variability for its loss and LAE reserves for specialty personal automobile insurance. The Company estimates that the Company's specialty personal automobile insurance loss and LAE reserves could have varied by $59.1 million in either direction at December 31, 2018 for all accident years combined under this scenario. In addition to the factors described above, other factors may also impact loss reserve development in future periods. These factors include governmental actions, including court decisions interpreting existing laws, regulations or policy provisions, developments related to insurance policy claims and coverage issues, adverse or favorable outcomes in pending claims litigation, the number and severity of insurance claims, the impact of inflation on insurance claims and the impact of required participation in windpools and joint underwriting associations and residual market assessments. Although the Company's actuaries do not make specific numerical assumptions about these factors, changes in these factors from past patterns will impact historical loss development factors and, in turn, future loss reserve development. Significant favorable changes in one or more factors will lead to favorable future loss reserve development, which could result in the actual loss developing closer to, or even below, the lower end of the Company's estimated reserve variability. Significant unfavorable changes in one or more factors will lead to unfavorable loss reserve development, which could result in the actual loss developing closer to, or even above, the higher end of the Company's estimated reserve variability. Accordingly, due to these factors and the other factors enumerated throughout the MD&A and the inherent limitations of the loss reserving estimation methodologies, the estimated and illustrated reserve variability may not necessarily be indicative of the Company's future reserve variability, which could ultimately be greater than the estimated and illustrated variability. In addition, as previously noted, development will emerge in all of the Company's product lines over time. Accordingly, the Company's future reserve variability could ultimately be greater than the illustrated variability. Additional information pertaining to the estimation of, and development of, the Company's Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves is contained in Item 1 of Part I of this 2018 Annual Report under the heading Property and Casualty Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves.\u201d\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)\nGoodwill Recoverability\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. In 2018, the Company changed the date on which it performs the annual goodwill impairment test from January 1 to October 1, moving the test date closer to year-end. Accordingly, the Company performed two goodwill impairment tests in 2018, the first as of January 1, 2018 and the second as of October 1, 2018. The Company performed qualitative goodwill impairment assessments on both dates for all reporting units with goodwill. The qualitative assessment takes into consideration changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in management or key personnel, changes in strategy and changes in our stock price since the last quantitative assessment, which was performed on January 1, 2017. For each reporting unit tested, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit, and the Company concluded that the associated goodwill was recoverable.\nPension Benefit Obligations\nThe process of estimating the Company's pension benefit obligations and pension benefit costs is inherently uncertain and the actual cost of benefits may vary materially from the estimates recorded. These liabilities are particularly volatile due to their long-term nature and are based on several assumptions. The main assumptions used in the valuation of the Company's pension benefit obligations and pension costs are:\n \u2022 Estimated mortality of the participants and beneficiaries eligible for benefits; \n \u2022 Estimated expected long-term rates of returns on investments; and \n \u2022 Estimated rate used to discount the expected benefit payment to a present value.  A change in any one or more of these assumptions is likely to result in a projected benefit obligation or pension cost that differs from the actuarial estimates at December 31, 2018. Such changes in estimates may be material. For example, a one-percentage point decrease in the Company's estimated discount rate would increase the pension benefit obligation at December 31, 2018 by $75.9 million, while a one-percentage point increase in the rate would decrease the pension benefit obligation at December 31, 2018 by $62.8 million. A one-percentage point decrease in the Company's estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase the pension expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 by $5.4 million, while a one-percentage point increase in the rate would decrease pension expense by $5.4 million for the same period.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nExcept for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered standards, the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) is the sole source of authoritative GAAP recognized by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) that is applicable to the Company.

In the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment, segment net operating results increased by $71.1 million due primarily to lower catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) and the favorable impact of loss and LAE reserve development, partially offset by higher insurance expenses as a percentage of earned premiums. See MD&A, Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 33 for additional discussion of the segment's results. In the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment, segment net operating results increased by $59.5 million due primarily to the impact of lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums on a higher level of earned premiums, higher net investment income and lower levels of adverse loss and LAE reserve development, partially offset by the impact of higher insurance expenses as a percentage of earned premiums on a higher level of earned premiums and driven by the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments associated with Kemper's acquisition of Infinity.

In the Life & Health Insurance segment, segment net operating income decreased by $0.4 million due primarily to higher policyholders' benefits and incurred losses and LAE and lower net investment income, almost entirely offset by lower income tax expense due to the lower corporate income tax rate in 2018. See MD&A, Life & Health Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 45 for additional discussion of the segment's results. Additionally, the Company's results were impacted in 2018, compared to 2017, by transaction and integration costs associated with Kemper's acquisition of Infinity and a loss from the change in the fair value of the Company's equity security portfolio, for which such changes are recorded through the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2018, compared to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, in 2017, partially offset by the positive effects of tax law changes and the partial satisfaction of a legal judgment. See MD&A, Investment Results,\u201d beginning on page 50 and MD&A, Income Taxes,\u201d beginning on page 57 and Note 23, Contingencies.\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n2017 Compared with 2016\nThe Company's net income increased by $104.1 million in 2017, compared to 2016. In the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment, segment net operating results deteriorated by $61.0 million due primarily to higher incurred catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) and an unfavorable change in loss and LAE reserve development, partially offset by higher net investment income. See MD&A, Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 33 for additional discussion of the segment's results. In the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment, segment net operating results increased by $70.8 million due primarily to lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums, lower insurance expenses as a percentage of earned premiums and higher net investment income. See MD&A, Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 40 for additional discussion of the segment's results. In the Life & Health Insurance segment, segment net operating income increased by $60.9 million due primarily to a $50.5 million after-tax charge in 2016 to recognize the impact of using death verification databases in the Company's operations, including to determine its IBNR liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses for life insurance products. See MD&A, Life & Health Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 45 for additional discussion of the segment's results. The Company's results were also positively impacted in 2017, compared to 2016, by higher net realized gains on sales of investments, lower impairment losses recognized in earnings and a lower unallocated net operating loss, due primarily to an income tax benefit of $7.4 million to recognize the effects of changes in the federal income tax law. See MD&A, Investment Results,\u201d beginning on page 50 and MD&A, Income Taxes,\u201d beginning on page 57 for additional information.\nRevenues\n2018 Compared with 2017\nEarned Premiums were $3,384.4 million in 2018, compared to $2,350.0 million in 2017, an increase of $1,034.4 million driven primarily by growth in Kemper's legacy specialty personal automobile insurance and the acquisition of Infinity. Earned Premiums increased by $1,021.7 million, $0.4 million and $12.3 million in the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segment, Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance Segment and Life & Health Insurance segment, respectively.

Net Investment Income from Alternative Investments, which consist of Equity Method Limited Liability Investments, Fair Value Option Investments and other limited liability investments included in Equity Securities at Fair Value or Equity Securities at Modified Cost, decreased by $17.3 million. Alternative investment income from Equity Method Limited Liability Investments decreased by $13.8 million. Alternative investment income from limited liability investments included in either Equity Securities at Fair Value or Equity Securities at Modified Cost decreased by $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017. No Net Investment Income was recorded on Fair Value Option Investments for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1.3 million for the same period in 2017. See MD&A, Investment Results,\u201d under the sub-caption Net Investment Income\u201d beginning on page 50 for additional discussion.\nOther Income increased by $38.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, due primarily to the the partial satisfaction of a final judgment against Computer Sciences Corporation ( CSC\u201d). See Note 23,\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nSUMMARY OF RESULTS (Continued)\nContingencies.\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The Company cannot make any assurance as to the additional amounts of the final judgment that will actually be collected or when they may be received. The unpaid balance of the final judgment is treated as a gain contingency for accounting purposes and accordingly, is not recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, in 2018. As a result of adoption, beginning in 2018, changes in the fair value of the Company's investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Loss from Change in Fair Value of Equity and Convertible Securities recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $64.3 million in 2018. Prior to 2018, changes in the fair value of equity securities were recognized in other comprehensive income. See MD&A, Investment Results,\u201d under the sub-caption Loss from Change in Fair Value of Equity and Convertible Securities\u201d beginning on page 51 for additional discussion\nNet Realized Gains on Sales of Investments were $26.4 million in 2018, compared to $56.5 million in 2017. See MD&A, Investment Results,\u201d under the sub-caption Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments\u201d beginning on page 52 for additional discussion. Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings in 2018 and 2017 were $4.5 million and $14.3 million, respectively.

The Company cannot predict when or if similar investment gains or losses may occur in the future.\n2017 Compared with 2016\nEarned Premiums were $2,350.0 million in 2017, compared to $2,220.0 million in 2016, an increase of $130.0 million. Earned Premiums increased by $132.4 million and $8.8 million in the Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance and Life & Health Insurance segments, respectively. Earned Premiums decreased by $11.2 million in the Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance segment. See MD&A, Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 33, MD&A Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 40, and MD&A, Life & Health Insurance,\u201d beginning on page 45 for discussion of the changes in each segment's earned premiums.\nNet Investment Income increased by $28.9 million in 2017 due primarily to higher investment returns from Alternative Investments and higher levels of investments in fixed income securities, partially offset by lower yields on fixed income securities. Net Investment Income from Alternative Investments, which consist of Equity Method Limited Liability Investments, Fair Value Option Investments and other limited liability investments included in Equity Securities, increased by $27.1 million. Alternative investment income from Equity Method Limited Liability Investments, other limited liability investments included in Equity Securities, and Fair Value Option Investments increased by $17.3 million, $6.6 million and $3.2 million, respectively, in 2017, compared to 2016.

See MD&A, Investment Results,\u201d under the sub-caption Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings\u201d beginning on page 52 for additional discussion. The Company cannot predict when or if similar investment gains or losses may occur in the future.\nCATASTROPHES\nCatastrophes and natural disasters are inherent risks of the property and casualty insurance business. These catastrophic events and natural disasters include, without limitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, hailstorms, wildfires, high winds and winter storms. Such events result in insured losses that are, and will continue to be, a material factor in the results of operations and financial position of the Company's property and casualty insurance companies. Further, because the level of these insured losses occurring in any one year cannot be accurately predicted, these losses may contribute to material year-to-year fluctuations in the results of operations and financial position of these companies. Specific types of catastrophic events are more likely to occur at certain times within the year than others. This factor adds an element of seasonality to property and casualty insurance claims. The Company has adopted the industry-wide catastrophe classifications of storms and other events promulgated by ISO to track and report losses related to catastrophes. ISO classifies a disaster as a catastrophe when the event causes $25.0 million or more in direct insured losses to property and affects a significant number of policyholders and insurers. ISO-classified catastrophes are assigned a unique serial number recognized throughout the insurance industry.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCATASTROPHES (Continued)\nThe number of ISO-classified catastrophic events and catastrophe losses and LAE, net of reinsurance recoveries, (excluding loss and LAE reserve development) by range of loss and business segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are presented below. \nCatastrophe Reinsurance\nThe Company primarily manages its exposure to catastrophes and other natural disasters through a combination of geographical diversification, restrictions on the amount and location of new business production in such regions, modifications of, and/or limitations to coverages and deductibles for certain perils in such regions and a catastrophe reinsurance program for the Company's Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance and Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segments. Coverage under the catastrophe reinsurance program is provided in various contracts and layers. The Company's Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance and Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance segments also purchase reinsurance from the FHCF for hurricane losses in Florida at retentions lower than its catastrophe reinsurance program. The Life & Health Insurance segment also purchases reinsurance from the FHCF for hurricane losses in Florida. Except for the coverage provided by the FHCF, the Life & Health Insurance segment does not carry any other catastrophe reinsurance coverage.\nIn 2018 and 2017, the Company had catastrophe reinsurance recoveries of $31.8 million and $11.9 million under its catastrophe reinsurance programs, respectively. Catastrophe recoveries under the FHCF were not material in 2018 or 2017. In 2018 and 2017, the Company paid $0.4 million and $0.8 million in reinstatement premium, respectively. The Company did not pay any reinstatement premium in 2016.\nSee the Reinsurance\u201d subsection of the Property and Casualty Insurance Business\u201d and Life and Health Insurance Business\u201d sections of Item 1(c), Description of Business,\u201d and Note 20, Catastrophe Reinsurance,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's reinsurance programs.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nLOSS AND LAE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT\nIncreases (decreases) in the Company's property and casualty loss and LAE reserves for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 to recognize adverse (favorable) loss and LAE reserve development from prior accident years in continuing operations, hereinafter also referred to as reserve development\u201d in the discussion of segment results, are presented below. \nSee MD&A, Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d MD&A, Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d MD&A, Life & Health Insurance,\u201d and Note 6, Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's reserve development. See MD&A, Critical Accounting Estimates,\u201d of this 2018 Annual Report for additional information pertaining to the Company's process of estimating property and casualty insurance reserves for losses and LAE, and the estimated variability thereof, development of property and casualty insurance losses and LAE, and a discussion of some of the variables that may impact them.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nPursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, the Company is required to file consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The Company is permitted to include non-GAAP financial measures in its filings provided that they are defined along with an explanation of their usefulness to investors, are no more prominent than the comparable GAAP financial measures and are reconciled to such GAAP financial measures.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for the comparable GAAP financial measures, as they do not fully recognize the overall profitability of the Company's businesses.\nUnderlying Combined Ratio\nThe following discussions of segment results use the non-GAAP financial measures of (i) Underlying Losses and LAE and (ii) Underlying Combined Ratio. Underlying Losses and LAE (also referred to in the discussion as Current Year Non-catastrophe Losses and LAE\u201d) exclude the impact of catastrophe losses and loss and LAE reserve development from prior years from the Company's Incurred Losses and LAE, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Underlying Combined Ratio is computed by adding the Current Year Non-catastrophe Losses and LAE Ratio with the Insurance Expense Ratio. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is the Combined Ratio, which is computed by adding total incurred losses and LAE, including the impact of catastrophe losses and loss and LAE reserve development from prior years, with the Insurance Expense Ratio. The Company believes Underlying Losses and LAE and the Underlying Combined Ratio are useful to investors and are used by management to reveal the trends in the Company's Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance and Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance businesses that may be obscured by catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development. These catastrophe losses may cause the Company's loss trends to vary significantly between\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nperiods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on incurred losses and LAE and the combined ratio. Prior-year reserve developments are caused by unexpected loss development on historical reserves. Because reserve development relates to the re-estimation of losses from earlier years, it has no bearing on the performance of the Company's insurance products that were in force in the current period. The Company believes it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's underwriting performance.\nAdjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income\nAdjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income is an after-tax, non-GAAP financial measure and is computed by excluding from Income from Continuing Operations the after-tax impact of:\n1) Income (Loss) from Change in Fair Value of Equity and Convertible Securities;\n2) Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments;\n3) Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings related to investments;\n4) Acquisition Related Transaction, Integration and Other Costs;\n5) Loss from Early Extinguishment of Debt; and\n6) Significant non-recurring or infrequent items that may not be indicative of ongoing operations.\nSignificant non-recurring items are excluded when (a) the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years, and (b) there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is Income from Continuing Operations. There were no applicable significant non-recurring items that the Company excluded from the calculation of Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016.\nThe Company believes that Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income provides investors with a valuable measure of its ongoing performance because it reveals underlying operational performance trends that otherwise might be less apparent if the items were not excluded. Income (Loss) from Change in Fair Value of Equity and Convertible Securities, Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments and Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings related to investments included in the Company's results may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and external economic developments such as capital market conditions that impact the values of the Company's investments, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Acquisition Related Transaction, Integration and Other Costs may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by the timing of acquisitions and business decisions which are unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Loss from Early Extinguishment of Debt is driven by the Company's financing and refinancing decisions and capital needs, as well as external economic developments such as debt market conditions, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process.

Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $173.5 million in 2017, compared to $103.1 million in 2016, which is an increase of $70.4 million due primarily to California wildfires and higher average severity on catastrophic events with losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) of less than $15.0 million in 2017, compared to 2016. This increase was partially offset by two large catastrophes, both Texas hailstorms, occurring in 2016, with aggregated estimated losses and LAE of $61.9 million, compared to one such Texas hailstorm, occurring in 2017, with estimated losses and LAE of $43.9 million. Adverse loss and LAE reserve development (including catastrophe reserve development) was $15.7 million in 2017, compared to favorable development of $23.4 million in 2016.

The decrease in earned premium attributed to lower volume was primarily due to the run-off of the direct-to-consumer business. Incurred losses and LAE were $310.2 million, or 70.5% of earned premiums, in 2018, compared to $339.6 million, or 80.3% of earned premiums, in 2017. Incurred losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums decreased due primarily to a favorable change in loss and LAE reserve development, lower underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of related earned premiums and lower catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development). Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of related earned premiums were 70.2% in 2018, compared to 73.0% in 2017, which was an improvement of 2.8 percentage points due primarily to lower frequency of claims and higher average earned premiums, partially offset by higher severity of losses, particularly on bodily injury coverages. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $7.2 million in 2018, compared to $11.3 million in 2017.

Incurred losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums decreased due to reinsurance recoveries from the Company's 2018 catastrophe aggregate reinsurance program, partially offset by an unfavorable change in loss and LAE reserve development and higher underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums. Underlying losses and LAE as a percentage of earned premiums were 52.5% in 2018, compared to 48.9% in 2017, a deterioration of 3.6 percentage points due primarily to higher severity of losses, and to a lesser extent, higher frequency of claims, partially offset by higher average earned premium. Catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) were $75.2 million in 2018, compared to $157.3 million in 2017. This decrease was driven primarily by fewer catastrophe losses and LAE (excluding reserve development) from events with greater than $20.0 million in losses and LAE and reinsurance recoveries under the Company's 2018 aggregate property catastrophe reinsurance program.

Insurance Expenses decreased by $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016, due primarily to growth in business, partially offset by lower amortization of insurance in force.\nInterest and Other Expenses\nInterest expense increased by $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017, due primarily to higher levels of debt outstanding to facilitate the funding of the acquisition of Infinity. Interest expense decreased by $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016, due primarily to lower levels of debt outstanding and a lower average effective interest rate thereon. See MD&A, Liquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d and Note 7, Debt,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of debt activity.\nOther Expenses increased by $69.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017, due primarily to the acquisition of Infinity, the inclusion of acquisition related transaction, integration and other costs and higher employee compensation. Other Expenses decreased by $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016, due primarily to lower pension expense in 2017 resulting from the full-year effect of freezing benefit accruals under the Company's defined benefit pension plans and a longer amortization period to amortize actuarial losses, as discussed in Note 16 Pension Benefits\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, partially offset by net curtailment gains recognized in 2016, higher employee compensation and a charge to earnings in 2017 to record the ineffective portion of a hedging relationship related to the Company's debt issuance.\nINCOME TAXES\nOn December 22, 2017, Public Law 115-97, more commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), was enacted. The Tax Act includes numerous changes to existing federal income tax law, including a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. In 2017, pursuant to Staff Accounting Bulletin\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nINCOME TAXES (Continued)\nNo. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d), the Company recorded certain provisional amounts for the estimated income tax effects of the Tax Act on deferred income taxes.\nIn 2018, the Company finalized its determination of the effects of the Tax Act on deferred income taxes based on information received from third parties, completion of actuarial tax computations that impacted the amount of deductions related to reserves reportable for federal income tax purposes for tax years prior to 2018, and other items. As a result, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 in connection with the finalization of the tax effects, which was primarily attributable to the effect of the updated actuarial tax computations.\nThe Company's effective income tax rate from continuing operations differs from the Federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to (1) the Tax Act, (2) the effects of tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions, (3) certain indemnification recoveries recognized in earnings that result in an adjustment in the tax purchase price and are excluded from the determination of taxable income, and (4) the net effects of state income taxes.\nThe tax benefit recorded pursuant to the Tax Act was $26.4 million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Tax-exempt investment income and dividends received deductions were $22.4 million, $28.0 million and $28.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Estimated indemnification recoveries recognized in earnings result in an adjustment in the tax purchase price and are excluded from the determination of taxable income and income tax expense. Such recoveries were $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. State income tax expense, net of federal benefit, from continuing operations was $0.1 million and $0.6 million in 2018 and 2016, respectively. State income tax benefit, net of federal expense, from continuing operations was $0.1 million in 2017. See Note 15, Income Taxes,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of income taxes.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAmended and Extended Credit Agreement and Term Loan Facility\nOn June 8, 2018, the Company entered into an amended and extended credit agreement and term loan facility.

The term loan facility includes a delayed draw feature with borrowing capacity of $250.0 million and a maturity date two years from the borrowing date. Furthermore, the amended and extended credit agreement provides for an accordion feature whereby the Company can increase either the revolving credit or term loan borrowing capacity by $100.0 million. On June 29, 2018, the Company borrowed $250.0 million on the delayed draw term loan facility to facilitate the funding of the acquisition of Infinity. The proceeds from the term loan facility, net of debt issuance costs, were $249.4 million. On December 28, 2018, the Company repaid $215.0 million of the outstanding term loan. There were no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017 under the revolving credit agreement.\nInfinity Debt\nInfinity's liabilities at the acquisition date included $275.0 million principal amount, 5.0% Senior Notes due September 19, 2022 (the 2022 Infinity Senior Notes\u201d). The 2022 Senior Notes were recorded at a fair value of $282.1 million as of the acquisition date, with the $7.1 million premium being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term, resulting in an effective interest rate of 4.4%. On November 30, 2018 Kemper executed a guarantee to fully and unconditionally guarantee the payment and performance obligations of the 2022 Infinity Senior Notes.\nLong-term Debt\nThe Company has $450.0 million of 4.35% senior notes due February 15, 2025 (the 2025 Senior Notes\u201d) outstanding as of December 31, 2018. The Company initially issued $250.0 million of the 2025 Senior Notes in February of 2015. In June of 2017, Kemper issued an additional $200 million of the 2025 Senior Notes. The proceeds of the additional issuance were $200.2 million, net of discount and transaction costs, for an effective yield of 4.16%. The additional notes are fungible with the initial notes issued in 2015, and together are treated as part of a single series for all purposes under the indenture governing the 2025 Senior Notes. Kemper used the net proceeds from the additional issuance for general corporate purposes. The 2025 Senior Notes are unsecured and may be redeemed in whole at any time or in part from time to time at Kemper's option at specified redemption prices.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Continued)\nShort-term Debt\nKemper's subsidiaries, United Insurance and Trinity Universal Insurance Company ( Trinity\u201d), are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) of Chicago and Dallas, respectively. As a requirement of membership in the FHLB, United Insurance and Trinity maintain a certain level of investment in FHLB stock. Total holdings of FHLB of Chicago stock were $0.8 million and $0.4 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Total holdings of FHLB of Dallas stock were $3.3 million at both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nIn June of 2018, United Insurance received advances of $55.0 million from the FHLB of Chicago and Trinity received advances of $55.0 million from the FHLB of Dallas. The advances, which were repaid in full on July 13, 2018, were made to facilitate the funding of the acquisition of Infinity.\nIn March of 2018, United Insurance received advances of $10.0 million from the FHLB of Chicago. The advances, which mature in one year or less, were made in connection with the start-up of the Company's collateralized investment borrowing program. In connection with the advances, United Insurance pledged U.S. Government Agency securities with a fair value of $15.7 million at December 31, 2018. The fair value of the collateral pledged must be maintained at certain specified levels above the borrowed amount, which can vary depending on the assets pledged. If the fair value of the collateral declines below these specified levels of the amount borrowed, United Insurance would be required to pledge additional collateral or repay outstanding borrowings. Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018 includes $10.0 million related to these advances. There were no advances from the FHLB of Dallas outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nThere were no advances from the FHLB of Chicago or the FHLB of Dallas outstanding at December 31, 2017.\nSubsidiary Dividends and Capital Contributions\nVarious state insurance laws restrict the ability of Kemper's insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends without regulatory approval. Such insurance laws generally restrict the amount of dividends paid in an annual period to the greater of statutory net income from the previous year or 10% of statutory capital and surplus. Kemper's direct insurance subsidiaries paid dividends of $130.4 million, $108.1 million and $104.5 million to Kemper in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2019, Kemper estimates that its direct insurance subsidiaries would be able to pay $351 million in dividends to Kemper without prior regulatory approval.\nIn 2018, to fund growth initiatives and meet capital requirements, Kemper made a capital contribution of $20.0 million to its subsidiary, Alliance United Insurance Company.\nAcquisition of Infinity\nOn July 2, 2018, Kemper acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Infinity, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement dated February 13, 2018, with total cash, stock and equity-based compensation consideration paid to Infinity shareholders of approximately $1.5 billion. In conjunction with closing the acquisition, Kemper issued 13,184,107 shares, with an aggregate fair value of $982.5 million based on Kemper's July 2, 2018 stock price of $74.53, and paid $564.6 million in cash consideration to Infinity's shareholders. In addition, Kemper issued 44,010 restricted units under Kemper's equity-based compensation plan to replace Infinity restricted shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the closing. The aggregate fair value of such Kemper restricted units granted was $3.3 million at July 2, 2018, of which $1.6 million is attributed to service provided prior to the closing and included in consideration paid. The remaining amount of $1.7 million is attributed to future service and will be recognized in compensation expense primarily over a period of two years. The cash consideration was funded by cash on hand as of July 2, 2018, inclusive of $250.0 million in borrowings under the Company's delayed draw term loan facility and $110.0 million of Kemper subsidiary borrowings from the FHLB of Dallas and FHLB of Chicago. On July 13, 2018, Kemper subsidiaries repaid in full the $110.0 million of FHLB borrowings, plus accrued interest. On December 28, 2018, Kemper repaid $215.0 million of the delayed draw term loan facility.

Infinity is a national provider of auto insurance focused on serving the specialty automobile market. With approximately 10,600 independent agents and $1.4 billion in 2017 direct written premiums, Infinity is one of the largest nonstandard auto insurers in the United States.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Continued)\nCommon Stock Repurchases and Dividends to Shareholders\nOn August 6, 2014, the Board of Directors approved the 2014 Repurchase Program under which Kemper is authorized to repurchase up to $300 million of its common stock and terminated Kemper's remaining authorization under the 2011 Repurchase Program.\nDuring 2018 and 2017, Kemper did not repurchase any shares of its common stock. During 2016, Kemper repurchased approximately 0.1 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $3.8 million in open market transactions under the 2014 Repurchase Program. The Company had $243.7 million of remaining capacity under the 2014 Repurchase Program at December 31, 2018.\nKemper paid a quarterly dividend to shareholders of $0.24 per common share in each quarter of 2018 and 2017. Dividends paid were $56.4 million and $49.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nSources and Uses of Funds\nKemper directly held cash and investments totaling $100.6 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $197.3 million at December 31, 2017. Sources available for the repayment of indebtedness, repurchases of common stock, future shareholder dividend payments, additional capitalization of its direct insurance subsidiaries, and the payment of interest on Kemper's senior notes and subordinated debentures include cash and investments directly held by Kemper, receipt of dividends from Kemper's subsidiaries and borrowings under the credit agreement.\nThe primary sources of funds for Kemper's insurance subsidiaries are premiums, investment income and proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments, advances from the FHLBs of Dallas and Chicago, and capital contributions from Kemper. The primary uses of funds are the payment of policyholder benefits under life insurance contracts, claims and claims-related expenses under property and casualty insurance contracts and accident and health insurance contracts, the payment of commissions and general expenses, the purchase of investments, repayments of advances from the FHLBs of Dallas and Chicago and payment of dividends to Kemper. Generally, there is a time lag between when premiums are collected and when policyholder benefits and insurance claims are paid.\nIn the third quarter of 2016, the Company's Life & Health segment voluntarily began implementing a comprehensive process under which it cross-references its life insurance policies against the DMF and other death verification databases to identify potential instances where the beneficiaries may not have filed a claim following the death of an insured and initiate an outreach process to identify and contact beneficiaries and settle claims.\nDuring periods of growth, insurance companies typically experience positive operating cash flows and are able to invest a portion of their operating cash flows to fund future policyholder benefits and claims. During periods in which premium revenues decline, insurance companies may experience negative cash flows from operations and may need to sell investments to fund payments to policyholders and claimants. In addition, if the Company's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries experience several significant catastrophic events over a relatively short period of time, investments may have to be sold in advance of their maturity dates to fund payments, which could result in either investment gains or losses. Management believes that its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries maintain adequate levels of liquidity in the event that they were to experience several future catastrophic events over a relatively short period of time.\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities increased by $298.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017.

Equity Method Limited Liability Investments investing activities used net cash of $29.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to providing net cash of $20.2 million in 2017. As of January 1, 2018, with the adoption of new accounting guidance, the Company's historical Fair Value Option Investments are now carried as Equity Securities at Fair Value or Equity Securities at Modified Cost. Accordingly, no activity was recorded for Fair Value Option Investments for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared net cash provided by Fair Value Option Investing Activities of $35.2 million in 2017.\nNet Cash Used by Investing Activities was $105.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $238.1 million in 2016.

The Company did not use cash to purchase Corporate-owned Life Insurance during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to purchases of $7.5 million in 2016.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Company has no material obligations under guarantee contracts. The Company has no material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. The Company has no material obligations, including contingent obligations, under contracts that would be accounted for as derivative instruments. The Company has no obligations, including contingent obligations, arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity held by, and material to, the Company, where such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the Company. Accordingly, the Company has no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nEstimated cash disbursements pertaining to the Company's contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 are presented below. \nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS (Continued)\nAmounts included in Life and Health Insurance Policy Benefits within the contractual obligations table above represent the estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and beneficiaries. Such cash outflows are based on the Company's current assumptions for mortality, morbidity and policy lapse, but are undiscounted with respect to interest. Policies must remain in force for the policyholder or beneficiary to receive the benefit under the policy. Depending on the terms of a particular policy, future premiums from the policyholder may be required for the policy to remain in force. The Company estimates that future cash inflows would total $3.8 billion using the same assumptions used to estimate the cash outflows. The Company's Life Insurance Reserves in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets are generally based on the historical assumptions for mortality and policy lapse rates and are on a discounted basis. Accordingly, the sum of the amounts presented above for Life and Health Insurance Policy Benefits significantly exceeds the amount of Life and Health Insurance Reserves reported on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018.\nIn addition to the purchase obligations included above, the Company had certain investment commitments totaling $275.4 million at December 31, 2018. The funding of such investment commitments is dependent on a number of factors, the timing of which is indeterminate. The contractual obligations reported above also exclude the Company's liability of $4.4 million for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments, if any, for such liability. Other Contractual Obligations Reflected in Long Term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under GAAP primarily consist of interest obligations related to Long Term Debt Obligations.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nKemper's subsidiaries conduct their businesses in two industries: property and casualty insurance and life and health insurance. Accordingly, the Company is subject to several industry-specific accounting principles under GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The process of estimation is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results could ultimately differ materially from the estimated amounts reported in a company's financial statements. Different assumptions are likely to result in different estimates of reported amounts. The Company's critical accounting policies most sensitive to estimates include the valuation of investments, the valuation of property and casualty insurance reserves for losses and LAE, the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and the valuation of pension benefit obligations.\nValuation of Investments\nThe reported value of the Company's investments was $8,069.5 million at December 31, 2018, of which $7,140.1 million, or 88%, was reported at fair value, $187.0 million, or 2%, was reported under the equity method of accounting, $300.6 million, or 4%, was reported at unpaid principal balance and $441.8 million, or 6%, was reported at cost, modified cost or depreciated cost. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate risk, credit risk and overall market volatility risk. Accordingly, it is reasonably possible that changes in the fair values of the Company's investments reported at fair value will occur in the near term and such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Also, it is reasonably possible that changes in the carrying values of the Company's Equity Method Limited Liability Investments will occur in the near term and such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the financial statements because these issuers follow specialized industry accounting rules which require that they report all of their investments at fair value (See Item 1A., Risk Factors\u201d under the title The Company's investment portfolio is exposed to a variety of risks that may negatively impact net investment income and cause realized and unrealized losses\u201d).\nAs more fully described under the heading, Fair Value Measurements,\u201d in Note 2, Summary of Accounting Policies and Accounting Changes,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses a hierarchical framework which prioritizes and ranks the market observability used in fair value measurements.\nThe fair value of the Company's investments measured and reported at fair value was $7,140.1 million at December 31, 2018, of which $6,050.7 million, or 85%, were investments that were based on quoted market prices or significant value drivers that are observable, $897.4 million, or 13%, were investments where at least one significant value driver was unobservable and $192.0 million or 3% were investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Fair value measurements based on readily available, active, quoted market prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally are deemed to have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment, compared to fair value measurements based on significant unobservable inputs used in measuring fair value. The\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)\nprices that the Company might realize from actual sales of investments are likely to vary from their respective estimated fair values at December 31, 2018 due to changing market conditions and limitations inherent in the estimation process.\nThe classification of a company's investment in a financial instrument may affect its reported results. Under GAAP, a company may elect to use the fair value option method of accounting for some or all of its investments in financial instruments. Under the fair value option method of accounting, a company is required to recognize changes in fair values into income for the period reported. The Company has elected the fair value option for investments in fixed maturities with equity conversion features which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Convertible Securities. Accordingly, both the reported and fair values of the Company's investments in Convertible Securities accounted for under the fair value option method of accounting were $31.5 million at December 31, 2018. For investments in fixed maturities classified as held to maturity, a company is required to carry the investment at amortized cost, with only amortization occurring during the period recognized into income. None of the Company's investments in fixed maturities were classified as held to maturity at December 31, 2018. Changes in the fair value of investments in fixed maturities classified as available for sale are not recognized in income during the period, but rather are recognized as a separate component of AOCI until realized. Both the reported and fair values of the Company's investments in fixed maturities classified as available for sale were $6,424.2 million at December 31, 2018.\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values are recorded as Equity Securities at Fair Value with changes in fair values recognized into income for the period reported. Accordingly, both the reported and fair values of the Company's investments in Equity Securities at Fair Value were $684.4 million at December 31, 2018. The Company holds certain equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments from the same issuer. Changes in the carrying value of Equity Securities at Modified Cost due to observable price changes are recorded into income for the period reported.\nHad the Company elected the fair value option for all of its investments in financial instruments, the Company's reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2018, would have decreased by $174.9 million.\nThe Company regularly reviews its fixed maturity investment portfolio and holdings in Equity Securities at Modified Cost for factors that may indicate that a decline in the fair value of an investment below its cost, amortized cost or modified cost basis is other than temporary. Such reviews are inherently uncertain in that the value of the investment may not fully recover or may decline further in future periods. Some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value of an investment is other than temporary include, but are not limited to, the following:\nFixed Maturity Securities\n \u2022 The financial condition, credit rating and prospects of the issuer; \n \u2022 The length of time and magnitude of the unrealized loss; \n \u2022 The ability of the issuer to make scheduled principal and interest payments; \n \u2022 The volatility of the investment;  Equity Securities at Modified Cost\n \u2022 Opinions of the Company's external investment managers; \n \u2022 The financial condition and prospects of the issuer; \n \u2022 Current market conditions; \n \u2022 Changes in credit ratings; and \n \u2022 Changes in the regulatory environment. \nChanges in these factors from their December 31, 2018 evaluation date could result in the Company determining that a temporary decline in the fair value of an investment held and evaluated at December 31, 2018 is no longer temporary at a subsequent evaluation date. Such determination would result in an impairment loss recognized in earnings in the period such determination is made.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nThe Company's Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves are reported using the Company's estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and LAE for claims that occurred prior to the end of any given accounting period but have not yet been paid. The Company had $1,874.9 million and $1,016.8 million of gross loss and LAE reserves at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Reserves for the Company's business segments at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were: \nIn estimating the Company's Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves, the Company's actuaries exercise professional judgment and must consider, and are influenced by, many variables that are difficult to quantify. Accordingly, the process of estimating and establishing the Company's Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves is inherently uncertain, and the actual ultimate cost of known and unknown claims may vary materially from the estimated amounts reserved.\nThe Company's actuaries generally estimate reserves at least quarterly for most product lines and/or coverage levels using accident quarters or years spanning 10 or more years, depending on the product line and/or coverage level or emerging issues relating to them. The Company's actuaries use a variety of generally accepted actuarial loss reserving estimation methodologies, including, but not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 Incurred Loss Development Methodology; \n \u2022 Paid Loss Development Methodology; \n \u2022 Bornhuetter-Ferguson Incurred Loss Methodology; \n \u2022 Bornhuetter-Ferguson Paid Loss Methodology; and \n \u2022 Frequency and Severity Methodology.  The Company's actuaries generally review the results of at least four of the estimation methodologies, two based on paid data and two based on incurred data, to initially estimate the ultimate losses and LAE for the current accident quarter or year and re-estimate the ultimate losses and LAE for previous accident quarters or years to determine if changes in the previous estimates of the ultimate losses and LAE are indicated by the most recent data. In some cases, the methodologies produce a cluster of estimates with a tight band of indicated possible outcomes. In other cases, however, the methodologies produce conflicting results and wider bands of indicated possible outcomes, and the Company's actuaries perform additional analyses before making their final selections. However, such bands do not necessarily constitute a range of outcomes, nor does the Company's management or the Company's actuaries calculate a range of outcomes.\nThe key assumption in these estimation methodologies is that patterns observed in prior periods are indicative of how losses and LAE are expected to develop in the future and that such historical data can be used to predict and estimate ultimate losses and LAE. However, changes in the Company's business processes, by their very nature, are likely to affect the development patterns, which means the Company's actuaries must routinely evaluate the applicability of historical data in future projections. The ultimate impact of a single change in a business process is difficult to quantify and detect, and even more difficult if several changes to business processes occur over several years. Initially after a change is implemented, there are fewer data points, as compared to the historical data, for the Company's actuaries to analyze. With fewer data points to analyze, the Company's actuaries cannot be certain that observed differences from the historical data trends are a result of the change in business process or merely a random fluctuation in the data. As the Company's actuaries observe more data points following the change in business process, the Company's actuaries can gain more confidence in whether the change in business process is affecting the development pattern. The challenge for the Company's actuaries is how much weight to place on the development patterns based on the older historical data and how much weight to place on the development patterns based on more recent data.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)\nAt a minimum, the Company's actuaries analyze 70 product and/or coverage levels for either 40 accident quarters or 10 accident years for both losses and LAE using many of the loss reserving estimation methodologies identified above as well as other generally accepted actuarial estimation methodologies. In all, there are more than 10,000 combinations of accident quarters or years, coverage levels, and generally accepted actuarial estimation methodologies used to estimate the Company's unpaid losses and LAE. In some cases, the Company's actuaries make adjustments to the loss reserving estimation methodologies identified above or use additional generally accepted actuarial estimation methodologies to estimate ultimate losses and LAE.\nFor each accident quarter or year, the point estimate selected by the Company's actuaries is not necessarily one of the points produced by any particular one of the methodologies utilized, but often is another point selected by the Company's actuaries, using their professional judgment, that takes into consideration each of the points produced by the several loss reserving estimation methodologies used. In some cases, for a particular product, the current accident quarter or year may not have enough paid claims data to rely upon, leading the Company's actuaries to conclude that the incurred loss development methodology provides a better estimate than the paid loss development methodology. Therefore, the Company's actuaries may give more weight to the incurred loss development methodology for that particular accident quarter or year. As an accident quarter or year ages for that same product, the actuary may gain more confidence in the paid loss development methodology and begin to give more weight to the paid loss development methodology. The Company's actuaries' quarterly selections are summed by product and/or coverage levels to create the actuarial indication of the ultimate losses. More often than not, the actuarial indication for a particular product line and accident quarter is most heavily weighted toward the incurred loss development methodology, particularly for short-tail lines such as personal automobile insurance. Historically, the incurred loss development methodology has been more reliable in predicting ultimate losses for short-tail lines, especially in the more recent accident quarters or years, compared with the paid loss development methodology. However, in some circumstances changes can occur which impact numerous variables, including, but not limited to, those variables identified below that are difficult to quantify and/or impact the predictive value of prior development patterns relied upon in the incurred loss development methodology and paid loss development methodology. In those circumstances, the Company's actuaries must make adjustments to these loss reserving estimation methodologies or use additional generally accepted actuarial estimation methodologies. In those circumstances, the Company's actuaries, using their professional judgment, may place more weight on the adjusted loss reserving estimation methodologies or other generally accepted actuarial estimation methodologies until the newer development patterns fully emerge and the Company's actuaries can fully rely on the unadjusted loss reserving estimation methodologies. In the event of a wide variation among results generated by the different projection methodologies, the Company's actuaries further analyze the data using additional techniques.\nIn estimating reserves, the Company's actuaries exercise professional judgment and must consider, and are influenced by, many variables that are difficult to quantify, such as:\n \u2022 Changes in the level of minimum case reserves, and the automatic aging of those minimum case reserves; \n \u2022 Changes to claims practices, including, but not limited to, changes in the reporting and impact of large losses, timing of reported claims, changes in claims closing and re-opening patterns, adequacy of case reserves, implementation of new systems for handling claims, turnover of claims department staffs, timing and depth of the audit review of claims handling procedures; \n \u2022 Changes in underwriting practices; \n \u2022 Changes in the mix of business by state, class and policy limit within product line; \n \u2022 Growth in new lines of business; \n \u2022 Changes in the attachment points of the Company's reinsurance programs; \n \u2022 Medical costs, including, but not limited to, the ability to assess the extent of injuries and the impact of inflation; \n \u2022 Repair costs, including, but not limited to, the impact of inflation and the availability of labor and materials; \n \u2022 Changes in the judicial environment, including, but not limited to, the interpretation of policy provisions, the impact of jury awards and changes in case law; and \n \u2022 Changes in state regulatory requirements.  A change in any one or more of the foregoing factors is likely to result in a projected ultimate net loss and LAE that is different from the previously estimated reserve and/or previous frequency and severity trends. Such changes in estimates may be material.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)\nFor example, the Company's actuaries review frequency (number of claims per policy or exposure), severity (dollars of loss per claim) and average premium (dollars of premium per exposure). Actual frequency and severity experienced will vary depending on changes in mix by class of insured risk. Similarly, the actual frequency and rate of recovery from reinsurance will vary depending on changes in the attachment point for reinsurance. In particular, in periods of high growth or expansion into new markets, there may be additional uncertainty in estimating the ultimate losses and LAE. The contributing factors of this potential risk are changes in the Company's mix by policy limit and mix of business by state or jurisdiction.\nActuaries use historical experience and trends as predictors of how losses and LAE will emerge over time. However, historical experience may not necessarily be indicative of how actual losses and LAE will emerge. Changes in case reserve adequacy, changes in minimum case reserves and changes in internal claims handling procedures could impact the timing and recognition of incurred claims and produce an estimate that is either too high or too low if not adjusted for by the actuary. For example, if, due to changes in claims handling procedures, actual claims are settled more rapidly than they were settled historically, the estimate produced by the paid loss development methodology would tend to be overstated if the actuary did not identify and adjust for the impact of the changes in claims handling procedures. Similarly, if, due to changes in claims handling procedures, actual claim reserves are set at levels higher than past experience, the estimate produced by the incurred loss development methodology would tend to be overstated if the actuary did not identify and adjust for the impact of the changes in claims handling procedures.\nThe final step in the quarterly loss and LAE reserving process involves a comprehensive review of the actuarial indications by the Company's corporate actuary and corporate management who apply their collective judgment and determine the appropriate estimated level of reserves to record. Numerous factors are considered in this determination process, including, but not limited to, the assessed reliability of key loss trends and assumptions that may be significantly influencing the current actuarial indications, changes in claim handling practices or other changes that affect the timing of payment or development patterns, changes in the mix of business, the maturity of the accident quarter or year, pertinent trends observed over the recent past, the level of volatility within a particular line of business, the improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications in the current period as compared to prior periods, and the amount of reserves related to third party pools for which the Company does not have access to the underlying data and, accordingly, relies on calculations provided by such pools.\nEstimated Variability of Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves\nThe Company's goal is to ensure that its total reserves for property and casualty insurance losses and LAE are adequate to cover all costs, while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves for losses and LAE are initially estimated until losses and LAE are fully developed. Changes in the Company's estimates of these losses and LAE over time, also referred to as development,\u201d will occur and may be material. Favorable development is recognized and reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements when the Company decreases its previous estimate of ultimate losses and LAE and results in an increase in net income in the period recognized, whereas adverse development is recognized and reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements when the Company increases its previous estimate of ultimate losses and LAE and results in a decrease in net income.\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)\nDevelopment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, was:\n\nSee MD&A, Loss and LAE Reserve Development,\u201d Preferred Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d Specialty Property & Casualty Insurance,\u201d and Life & Health Insurance,\u201d for further information on development reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAlthough development will emerge in all of the Company's product lines, development in the Company's specialty personal automobile insurance product line could have the most significant impact due to the relative size of its loss and LAE reserves. To further illustrate the sensitivity of the Company's reserves for specialty personal automobile insurance losses and LAE, the Company measures the standard deviation of the mean reserve estimate using a bootstrapping methodology. The Company believes that one standard deviation of variability is a reasonably likely scenario to measure variability for its loss and LAE reserves for specialty personal automobile insurance. The Company estimates that the Company's specialty personal automobile insurance loss and LAE reserves could have varied by $59.1 million in either direction at December 31, 2018 for all accident years combined under this scenario. In addition to the factors described above, other factors may also impact loss reserve development in future periods. These factors include governmental actions, including court decisions interpreting existing laws, regulations or policy provisions, developments related to insurance policy claims and coverage issues, adverse or favorable outcomes in pending claims litigation, the number and severity of insurance claims, the impact of inflation on insurance claims and the impact of required participation in windpools and joint underwriting associations and residual market assessments. Although the Company's actuaries do not make specific numerical assumptions about these factors, changes in these factors from past patterns will impact historical loss development factors and, in turn, future loss reserve development. Significant favorable changes in one or more factors will lead to favorable future loss reserve development, which could result in the actual loss developing closer to, or even below, the lower end of the Company's estimated reserve variability. Significant unfavorable changes in one or more factors will lead to unfavorable loss reserve development, which could result in the actual loss developing closer to, or even above, the higher end of the Company's estimated reserve variability. Accordingly, due to these factors and the other factors enumerated throughout the MD&A and the inherent limitations of the loss reserving estimation methodologies, the estimated and illustrated reserve variability may not necessarily be indicative of the Company's future reserve variability, which could ultimately be greater than the estimated and illustrated variability. In addition, as previously noted, development will emerge in all of the Company's product lines over time. Accordingly, the Company's future reserve variability could ultimately be greater than the illustrated variability. Additional information pertaining to the estimation of, and development of, the Company's Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves is contained in Item 1 of Part I of this 2018 Annual Report under the heading Property and Casualty Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves.\u201d\nKemper Corporation and Subsidiaries\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (Continued)\nGoodwill Recoverability\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. In 2018, the Company changed the date on which it performs the annual goodwill impairment test from January 1 to October 1, moving the test date closer to year-end. Accordingly, the Company performed two goodwill impairment tests in 2018, the first as of January 1, 2018 and the second as of October 1, 2018. The Company performed qualitative goodwill impairment assessments on both dates for all reporting units with goodwill. The qualitative assessment takes into consideration changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in management or key personnel, changes in strategy and changes in our stock price since the last quantitative assessment, which was performed on January 1, 2017. For each reporting unit tested, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit, and the Company concluded that the associated goodwill was recoverable.\nPension Benefit Obligations\nThe process of estimating the Company's pension benefit obligations and pension benefit costs is inherently uncertain and the actual cost of benefits may vary materially from the estimates recorded. These liabilities are particularly volatile due to their long-term nature and are based on several assumptions. The main assumptions used in the valuation of the Company's pension benefit obligations and pension costs are:\n \u2022 Estimated mortality of the participants and beneficiaries eligible for benefits; \n \u2022 Estimated expected long-term rates of returns on investments; and \n \u2022 Estimated rate used to discount the expected benefit payment to a present value.  A change in any one or more of these assumptions is likely to result in a projected benefit obligation or pension cost that differs from the actuarial estimates at December 31, 2018. Such changes in estimates may be material. For example, a one-percentage point decrease in the Company's estimated discount rate would increase the pension benefit obligation at December 31, 2018 by $75.9 million, while a one-percentage point increase in the rate would decrease the pension benefit obligation at December 31, 2018 by $62.8 million. A one-percentage point decrease in the Company's estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase the pension expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 by $5.4 million, while a one-percentage point increase in the rate would decrease pension expense by $5.4 million for the same period.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nExcept for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered standards, the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) is the sole source of authoritative GAAP recognized by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) that is applicable to the Company.

million in 2017. The increase was driven by lower catastrophe losses, favorable loss reserve development, and the partial satisfaction of a legal judgment.\n\n- Earned premiums increased significantly to $3.4 billion in 2018 from $2.4 billion in 2017, primarily due to growth in Kemper's legacy specialty auto insurance business and the acquisition of Infinity insurance. \n\n- The Specialty P&C segment reported a $59.5 million increase in net operating income to $115.8 million, driven by lower losses and expenses as well as higher investment income.\n\n- The Preferred P&C segment swung to net operating income of $25.7 million from a loss of $45.4 million, due to lower catastrophe losses, favorable loss reserve development, and higher investment income. This was partially offset by higher insurance expenses.\n\n- The Life & Health segment's net operating income was flat at $91.5 million as lower policyholder benefits were offset by higher expenses.\n\n- In July 2018, Kemper completed its $1.5 billion acquisition of Infinity Property and Casualty, a national provider of specialty auto insurance.\n\n- Kemper estimates its insurance subsidiaries could pay $351 million of dividends in 2019 without prior regulatory approval.\n\n- Kemper's total investments were $8.1 billion at year-end 2018, with 88% reported at fair value. Estimating reserves and their variability along with the valuation of investments were noted as critical accounting estimates."}
