Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d section of this annual report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions described in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this annual report and included elsewhere in this annual report. Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section and included elsewhere in this annual report.\nIn this section and other parts of this Form 10-K, we refer to certain measures used for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We also may refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), but have corresponding GAAP-based measures. Where non-GAAP measures appear, we provide tables reconciling these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP-based measures and make reference to a discussion of their use. We believe these measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making.\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday that is closest to December 31 of that year. Each fiscal year generally comprises four 13-week fiscal quarters, although in the years with 53 weeks the fourth quarter represents a 14-week period. References to Fiscal 2017 relate to our 52-week fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. References to Fiscal 2016 relate to our 52-week fiscal year ended January 1, 2017. References to Fiscal 2015 relate to our 53-week fiscal year ended January 3, 2016.\nOverview\nFogo de Ch\u00e3o (fogo-dee-shoun) is a leading Brazilian steakhouse, or churrascaria, which has specialized for nearly 40 years in fire-roasting high-quality meats utilizing the centuries-old Southern Brazilian cooking technique of churrasco. We deliver a distinctive and authentic Brazilian dining experience through the combination of our high-quality Brazilian cuisine and our differentiated service model known as espeto corrido (Portuguese for continuous service\u201d) delivered by our churrasqueiros, which we refer to as our gaucho chefs. We offer our guests a variety of menu choices including our most popular offering the Full Churrasco Experience as well Gaucho Lunch, Weekend Brazilian Brunch and Bar Fogo menu items. The Full Churrasco Experience, our prix fixe menu, provides the opportunity to experience a variety of meats including beef, lamb, pork and chicken, simply seasoned and carefully fire-roasted to expose their natural flavors as well as a selection of fresh seasonal salads and specialty items at the Market Table.\nGrowth Strategies and Outlook\nOur growth is based on the following strategies:\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Grow our restaurant base;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Grow our comparable restaurant sales; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Improve margins by leveraging our infrastructure and investments in human capital.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe we are in the early stages of our growth with 50 current restaurants, 38 in the US, nine in Brazil and three international joint venture restaurants. Based on internal analysis and a study prepared by an independent third party, we believe there is a long-term growth potential for more than 100 domestic sites, with additional new restaurants internationally. We have a long track record of successful new restaurant development, having grown our restaurant count by a multiple of 10 since 2000, and at a 12.4% CAGR since 2010. While new restaurants are expected to be a key driver of our growth, we believe positive comparable restaurant sales growth and margin expansion through leveraging our infrastructure will also contribute to future growth.\nHighlights and Trends\nRestaurant Development\nRestaurant openings reflect the number of new restaurants opened during a particular reporting period. During Fiscal 2017 we opened our third international joint venture restaurant in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Over the next five years, we plan to increase our company-owned restaurant count by at least 10% annually, with North America being our primary market for new restaurant development. In addition, over the next five years, we plan to opportunistically open new restaurants in Brazil as attractive real estate locations become available. We will pursue growth in international markets through a combination of company-owned restaurants and joint ventures, which we believe allows us to expand our brand with limited capital investment by us. The actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control including, but not limited to, weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant Activity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning of Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Openings(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Closings(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurants at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> We opened our first Middle East JV restaurant in August 2017.

( Rh\u00f4ne\u201d) and Prime Cut Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( Merger Subsidiary\u201d), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into the Company, which will survive as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent will finance the Merger with a combination of debt and equity financing.\nAt the effective time of the Merger,\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> each share of the Company's common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive $15.75 in cash, without interest;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> each Company outstanding stock option will be cancelled, with the holder of such stock option becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (a) $15.75 minus (b) the exercise price per share of common stock subject to such stock option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of common stock subject to such stock option; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the restrictions on each Company outstanding restricted stock will lapse, with the holder of such performance-based restricted stock becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) $15.75 multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of common stock subject to such restricted stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFollowing execution of the Merger Agreement, certain affiliates and co-investors of Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. and certain directors and executive officers of the Company, who collectively hold approximately 61.56% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock of the Company, executed and delivered to the Company a written consent adopting the Merger Agreement. The Merger cannot be consummated until the passing of 20 calendar days from the date on which the Company mails to the Company's stockholders an information statement describing the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on Schedule 14C under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Following delivery of the written consent, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company may not engage in any further discussions or solicitations regarding the potential acquisition of the Company by any third party, and the Company has no ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into an alternative transaction.\nThe completion of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including, without limitation, (1) the absence of any restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other court order or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the Merger, (2) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (3) subject to certain qualifications, the accuracy of representations and warranties of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary, and (4) the performance in all material respects of the obligations of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary, respectively. The Merger is not subject to a financing condition. Completion of the Merger is expected early in the second fiscal quarter of 2018.\nNatural Disasters\nDuring the third quarter of Fiscal 2017, our operations were impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria which struck the US mainland and Puerto Rico adversely affecting 10 of our US restaurants. Most of the affected restaurants were minimally impacted, however four restaurants were significantly impacted requiring them to close for multiple days. These closures extended prior to landfall through the post-hurricane clean up periods. The US mainland restaurants returned to operations within a week of the hurricanes, with sales exceeding expectations for the remainder of Fiscal 2017. Our restaurant in San Juan, Puerto Rico re-opened mid-November 2017 with sales also exceeding our expectations for the remainder of Fiscal 2017. We maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our restaurants including property, flood and business interruption. Initial assessments have found minimal structural and cosmetic damage to the restaurants; however we are working with our insurance providers to assess the overall impact from the hurricanes and expect that process to take some time. As a result of the hurricane activity, we estimate total revenue was negatively impacted by $1.6 million for Fiscal 2017. We expect to recover a portion of the lost income through insurance recoveries in Fiscal 2018. The Company has not recorded any gains related to insurance recoveries during Fiscal 2017.\nIn addition, operations of our Mexican JV were impacted by multiple major earthquakes that affected the greater Mexico City metropolitan area. Our two restaurants in Mexico City sustained minimal cosmetic damage and we believe no structural damage. To date, we have not experienced a loss of operating days as a result of the earthquakes.\nSecondary Offering\nOn May 17, 2017, we completed a secondary offering of 5,175,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $14.00 per share, which included 675,000 shares sold to the underwriters pursuant to their over-allotment option. As all of these shares were offered by certain selling stockholders we did not receive any proceeds from the offering.\n2016 Summer Olympics\nRio de Janeiro hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics which were held during the third quarter of Fiscal 2016. As a result, we estimate our two Rio de Janeiro restaurants contributed approximately $1.4 million of incremental revenue in the third quarter of Fiscal 2016.\nRecent Events in Brazil\nBrazil's political environment has historically influenced, and continues to influence, the performance of the country's economy. Starting in 2015 a series of protests began in Brazil against the Brazilian government and its President. The initial protests occurred in cities throughout Brazil, including Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paolo, and continued throughout the remainder of 2015, culminating in the impeachment of the President of Brazil in 2016. After a somewhat successful start to the new President's administration, their proposed pension overhaul faced significant opposition with protests occurring in a number of cities in response to the government's austerity plans. The new administration also endured a number of scandals emerging from ongoing anti-corruption campaign which ultimately led to the current President's indictment on corruption charges in June 2017. In August 2017, Brazil's Lower House of government voted against sending the trial to Brazil's Supreme Court; however, a second round of corruption charges were leveled against the current President, whose term is due to end in October 2018, in September 2017. The protests and political unrest contributed to lower guest traffic in our restaurants in Brazil, in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2017. Additionally, growing security concerns are affecting guest traffic in our two Rio de Janeiro restaurants. While we believe these issues are temporary, should indicators suggest a permanent reduction in guest traffic and cash flows due to the prolonged unrest, the recovery of carrying value of certain Brazilian assets could be challenged.\nIn addition to the uncertain political environment, Brazil continues to suffer from a protracted economic recession that is negatively impacting our guests. Although we believe Fiscal 2017 represents an inflection point for the Brazilian economy, as supported by improving economic forecasts, political turbulence continues to cast a long shadow on the strength of the recovery. Nevertheless, we believe Brazil's economy will likely continue recovering as we lap the economic recession. With our focus on US development, Brazil will continue becoming a smaller portion of the overall business, representing less than 15% of our consolidated revenue base for the second half of Fiscal 2017.\nBrazilian legislation regulating the collection of tips in commercial establishments was approved by the President of Brazil and became effective on May 13, 2017. We have implemented new procedures intended to facilitate our compliance with the new tip legislation, however, we cannot predict whether our procedures will fully comply with any regulations that may be adopted in furtherance of the legislation or judicial determinations as to the requirements of the legislation. Additionally, comprehensive labor reform legislation became effective in November 2017. We anticipate that the new laws will be tested in Brazilian courts. We are attempting to implement the changes required under the new laws, but cannot predict the potential impact of the new laws, or judicial interpretation of such laws, on our business or prospective results of operations.\nTax Law Changes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law by President Trump. The Tax Act significantly revised the US corporate income tax regime by, among other things, lowering the US corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also repealing the deduction for domestic production activities, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. US GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $15.0 million due to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and a tax charge of $6.5 million due to the transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, in the three months ended December 31, 2017. Both of the tax benefit and the tax charge represent provisional amounts and the Company's current best estimates. Any adjustments recorded to the provisional amounts through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 will be included in income from operations as an adjustment to tax expense. The provisional amounts incorporate assumptions made based upon the Company's current interpretation of the Tax Act and may change as the Company receives additional clarification and implementation guidance.\nCommodity Pricing\nWe experienced lower and stable beef prices in Fiscal 2017, which allowed us to offset inflation on food costs and other meats as compared to Fiscal 2016. Prices at food-at-home outlets have posted lower year-over-year price increases, and supermarket prices decreased for the second year in a row, falling approximately 0.2 percent. Inflation has been lower than average due, in part, to a stronger US dollar.\nExchange Rate Impact\nWe experienced significant foreign currency improvement from Fiscal 2016 to Fiscal 2017 due to fluctuations of the Brazilian Real relative to the US dollar. When the Brazilian Real strengthens compared to the US dollar, it has a positive impact on our Brazilian operating results upon translation of those results into US dollars for the purposes of consolidation. We anticipate foreign currency to stabilize throughout Fiscal 2018 with respect to the Brazilian Real. See Supplemental Selected Constant Currency Information\u201d on page 60 for the exchange rate impact on current financial periods.\nPerformance Indicators\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures we use for determining how our business is performing are the number of new restaurant openings, comparable restaurant sales, restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP measures. See page 56 for discussion of non-GAAP financial measures.\nNew Restaurant Openings\nOur ability to successfully open new restaurants and expand our restaurant base is critical to adding revenue capacity to meet our goals for growth. New restaurant openings contribute additional operating weeks and revenue to our business. Before a new restaurant opens, we incur pre-opening costs, as described below. New restaurants often open with an initial start-up period of sales volatility. Operating margins tend to stabilize within twelve months of opening. New restaurants typically experience normal inefficiencies in the form of higher food, labor and other direct operating expenses and, as a result, restaurant contribution margins are generally lower during the start-up period of operation. To achieve our goal to successfully open new restaurants, we consider a number of factors including macro and micro economic conditions, availability of appropriate locations, competition in local markets, and the availability of teams to manage new locations. The actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of our control including, but not limited to, weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.\nComparable Restaurant Sales\nWe consider a restaurant to be comparable during the first full fiscal quarter following the eighteenth full month of operations. We adjust the sales included in the comparable restaurant calculation for restaurant closures, primarily as a result of remodels, so that the periods will be comparable. Changes in comparable restaurant sales reflect changes in sales for the comparable group of restaurants over a specified period of time. Changes in comparable sales reflect changes in guest count trends as well as changes in average check per person, as described below. This measure highlights performance of existing restaurants, as the impact of new restaurant openings is excluded. The Company uses a 52/53 week fiscal year convention. For fiscal years following a 53 week year the Company calculates comparable restaurant sales using the most comparable calendar week to the current reporting period.\nAverage Check Per Person\nAverage check per person is calculated by dividing total comparable restaurant sales by comparable restaurant guest counts for a given time period. Average check per person is influenced by menu prices and menu mix. Management uses this indicator to analyze trends in guests' preferences, the effectiveness of menu offerings and per guest expenditures.\nAverage Unit Volumes\nWe measure average unit volumes ( AUVs\u201d) on an annual (52-week) basis. In fiscal years with 53 weeks, we exclude the 53rd week from the AUV calculation for consistency purposes. AUVs consist of the average sales of all restaurants that have been open for a trailing 52-week period or longer. We adjust the sales included in AUV calculations for restaurant closures. This measurement allows us to assess changes in consumer spending patterns at our restaurants and the overall performance of our restaurant base.\nGuest Counts\nGuest counts are measured by the number of entr\u00e9es ordered at our restaurants over a given time period. Examples of our entr\u00e9es include our Full Churrasco Experience, \u00e0 la carte seafood items, and Gaucho Lunch.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of our Operating Results\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act significantly revised the US tax code by, in part but not limited to: a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of US international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. Under Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes, the Company must recognize the effects of tax law changes in the period in which the new legislation is enacted.\n52 vs. 53 Week Fiscal Year\nFiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 contained 52 weeks whereas Fiscal 2015 contained 53 weeks. We estimate the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 contributed approximately $6.8 million of incremental revenue, as compared to Fiscal 2016. While certain expenses that were directly related to the incremental revenue increased, other expenses, such as fixed costs, were incurred on a calendar basis.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn June 24, 2015, we completed our initial public offering (\"IPO\") of 5,073,528 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $20.00 per share, which included 661,764 shares of common stock sold to the underwriters pursuant to their option to purchase additional shares. After underwriters' discounts and commissions and offering costs, we received net proceeds from the IPO of $91.3 million. Proceeds from the IPO, together with borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility, were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our 2012 Credit Facility.\nCertain share-based awards granted from 2012 through 2015 include vesting conditions that require both (i) completion of a four or five-year vesting period and (ii) satisfaction of a Liquidity Event, as defined in the applicable award agreement. Under the terms of those agreements, a Liquidity Event is defined as the earlier to occur of (i) a change in control transaction or (ii) an initial public offering. Upon the closing of the IPO, options for the purchase of 783,606 shares of common stock vested as a result of the satisfaction of the Liquidity Event vesting condition. The Company recognized $5.7 million of compensation expense associated with these options during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\nTermination of the Advisory Services Agreement\nAs a result of the IPO, we terminated our Advisory Services Agreement with an affiliate of Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. and paid a one-time non-recurring payment of $7.5 million in connection with the termination during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. While we have benefitted from savings on management fees that we incurred as a private company, these benefits have been offset by the incremental costs we incurred as a public company such as legal, accounting, insurance and other compliance costs.\n2015 Credit Facility\nConcurrently with the consummation of our IPO, we refinanced our 2012 Credit Facility and entered into a new $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the 2015 Credit Facility\u201d). Loans under the 2015 Credit Facility bear interest at a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.50% or at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.50% and will mature in 2020. The 2015 Credit Facility contains customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries, including financial maintenance covenants requiring us to maintain a maximum Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (each as defined in the underlying credit facility agreement). Starting in Fiscal 2017 and through Fiscal 2018, the Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio may not be greater than 5.25 to 1 and the ratio will further reduce to 5.0 to 1 in Fiscal 2019, through maturity. The Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio may not be less than 2.00 to 1. Borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility may vary significantly from time to time depending on our cash needs at any given time. Upon the consummation of our IPO we drew $165.0 million under the 2015 Credit Facility and used those borrowings, along with the net proceeds from our IPO, to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the 2012 Credit Facility. We recorded a loss of $6.0 million on the extinguishment of the 2012 Credit Facility during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\nStock Split\nIn connection with the closing of the IPO, we effected a stock split pursuant to which each share held by the holder of common stock was reclassified into 25.4588 shares. All share and per share data have been retroactively restated to give effect to the stock split.\nSignificant Components of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nRevenue primarily consists of food and beverage sales, net of any employee meals and complimentary meals. Revenue is recognized when food and beverage products are sold at our restaurants net of any discounts. Revenue in a given period is directly influenced by the number of operating weeks in such period, the number of restaurants we operate and comparable restaurant sales growth. Proceeds from the sale of gift cards that do not have expiration dates are recorded as deferred revenue at the time of the sale and recognized as revenue when the gift card is redeemed by the holder. The portion of gift cards sold which are never redeemed is commonly referred to as gift card breakage. We recognize gift card breakage revenue for gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and we determine there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to governmental agencies.\nFood and Beverage Costs\nFood and beverage costs include the direct costs associated with food, beverage and distribution of our menu items. We measure food and beverage costs by tracking the cost as a percentage of revenue. Food and beverage costs as a percentage of revenue are generally influenced by the cost of food and beverage items, distribution costs and sales mix. These components are variable in nature, increase with revenue, are subject to increases or decreases based on fluctuations in commodity costs, including beef, lamb, pork, chicken and seafood prices, and depend in part on the controls we have in place to manage costs at our restaurants.\nCompensation and Benefit Costs\nCompensation and benefits costs comprise restaurant and regional management salaries and bonuses, hourly staff payroll and other payroll-related expenses, including bonus expenses, share-based compensation, vacation pay, payroll taxes, fringe benefits and health insurance expenses and are measured by tracking hourly and total labor as a percentage of revenue.\nOccupancy and Other Operating Expenses\nOccupancy and other operating expenses comprise all occupancy costs, consisting of both fixed and variable portions of rent, common area maintenance charges, utility costs, credit card fees, real estate property and other related taxes and other related restaurant supply and occupancy costs, but exclude depreciation and amortization expense, and are measured by tracking occupancy and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nMarketing and advertising costs include all media, production and related costs for both local restaurant advertising and national marketing. We measure the efficiency of our marketing and advertising expenditures by tracking these costs as a percentage of total revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nGeneral and administrative costs are comprised of costs related to certain corporate and administrative functions that support development and restaurant operations. These expenses are generally fixed and reflect management, supervisory and staff salaries, employee benefits and bonuses, share-based compensation, travel expense, information systems, training, corporate rent, technology, market research, and professional and consulting fees, including fees related to the implementation of, and compliance with, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We measure general and administrative costs by tracking general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue.\nPre-opening Costs\nPre-opening costs are costs incurred prior to, and directly associated with, opening a restaurant, and primarily consist of manager salaries, relocation costs, recruiting expenses, employee payroll and related training costs for new employees, including rehearsal of service activities, as well as straight-line lease costs incurred prior to opening. In addition, pre-opening costs include public relations costs incurred prior to opening. We typically start incurring pre-opening costs four to six months prior to opening and these costs tend to increase four weeks prior to opening as we begin training activities.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and certain definite life intangible assets. We depreciate capitalized leasehold improvements over the shorter of the total expected lease term or their estimated useful life.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we operate. Historically we have generated taxable income in the US and Brazil. Our provision includes federal, state and local, and foreign current and deferred income tax expense.\nSegment Reporting\nWe operate our restaurants using a single restaurant concept and brand. Each restaurant under our single global brand operates with similar types of products and menu, providing a continuous service style, similar contracts, customers and employees, irrespective of location. We have identified two operating segments: US and Brazil, which is how we organize our restaurants for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Our joint venture in Mexico is included in the US for segment reporting purposes as the operations of the joint venture are monitored by the US segment management. License fee revenue, store opening fee and country development fee revenue attributable to our joint venture in the Middle East JV is included in other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize key components of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue:\nFiscal 2017 (52 Weeks) Compared to Fiscal 2016 (52 Weeks)\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td>

increased due to a $25.3 million increase in non-comparable restaurant sales, a favorable foreign exchange impact of $3.3 million, and a $0.2 million increase in joint venture revenue, offset by a $2.8 million decrease in comparable restaurant sales. Total comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.3%.\nUS restaurant revenue increased due to a $25.3 million increase in non-comparable restaurant sales and a $1.0 million increase in comparable restaurant sales. US comparable restaurant sales increased 0.5%.\nBrazil restaurant revenue decreased due to a $3.8 million decrease in comparable restaurant sales offset by a favorable foreign exchange impact of $3.3 million. Brazil comparable restaurant sales decreased 7.2%. The Rio de Janeiro locations' results included lapping the 2016 Summer Olympics during the third quarter of Fiscal 2017. Excluding the impact of the 2016 Summer Olympics, Brazil comparable restaurant sales decreased 4.3%\nOther revenue increased as our first Middle East JV restaurant opened in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. In connection with the Jeddah opening we recognized a country development fee and a store opening fee in addition to a recurring license fee.\nFood and Beverage Costs\nFood and beverage costs increased due to a $7.7 million increase in food and beverage costs of non-comparable restaurants and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $1.1 million, offset by a $1.3 million decrease in food and beverage costs of comparable restaurants. As a percentage of total revenue, total food and beverage costs remained flat in spite of new restaurant openings and the impact of the hurricanes, somewhat offset by reduced liquor and desserts costs in Brazil.\nCompensation and Benefit Costs\nCompensation and benefit costs increased due to a $7.7 million increase in non-comparable restaurant labor expense, a $0.7 million increase in comparable restaurant labor expense and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $0.5 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total compensation and benefits costs increased as a result of wage rate inflation in the US and Brazil in addition to inefficiencies associated with new restaurant openings, marginally offset by lower insurance costs.\nOccupancy and Other Operating Expenses\nOccupancy and other operating expenses increased due to a $5.7 million increase in non-comparable restaurant operating expenses, a $0.9 million increase in comparable restaurant operating expenses, and an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of $0.7 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total occupancy and other operating costs increased due to higher costs of rent as a percentage of sales in our new restaurants as these stores are in the early stages of their revenue growth curve, the timing of restaurant repairs, and local commercial rent taxes.\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nMarketing and advertising costs increased due to a refreshed advertising campaign during Fiscal 2017 as well as an increase in brand awareness advertising. As a percentage of total revenue, marketing and advertising costs increased marginally.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nGeneral and administrative costs increased due to a $1.6 million increase in corporate compensation as a result of additional headcount in the US, $0.7 million in expenses related to our secondary offering in the second quarter of Fiscal 2017, $0.4 million in concurrent corporate office rents as we transition to our new corporate office space, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $0.2 million and a $0.1 million donation to the Houston Food Bank in relation to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. These increases were offset by a decrease of $0.3 million in stock compensation expense. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative costs increased 0.3%.\nPre-opening Costs\nPre-opening costs increased due to the timing of new restaurant development. During Fiscal 2017 we opened five US restaurants and had an additional three restaurants under construction at year-end that are due to open in Fiscal 2018. During Fiscal 2016 we opened three US restaurants and had an additional three restaurants under construction at year-end that opened during the first half of Fiscal 2017.\nNon-cash Impairment Charges\nDuring Fiscal 2017, we recognized $4.2 million in non-cash impairment charges related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in the US. The Company continues to evaluate the restaurant's operating performance and its options. A closure of this restaurant could result in a material charge in the period in which the Company ceases operations. During Fiscal 2016, we recognized $0.3 million in non-cash impairment charges related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in Brazil. The lease for this underperforming restaurant in Brazil expired in September 2017 and was not renewed.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased slightly due to a 0.6% increase in the interest rate on our 2015 Credit Facility, which was alleviated marginally by a decrease in the average outstanding balance.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased due to increased cash and cash equivalents in Brazil and favorable interest rates earned on those balances.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act significantly revised the US tax code by, in part but not limited to: a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of US international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. Under Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes, the Company must recognize the effects of tax law changes in the period in which the new legislation is enacted.\nThe Fiscal 2017 income tax benefit was primarily comprised of $9.4 million of income tax expense at the federal statutory rate, $6.5 million expense related to its one-time repatriation inclusion, $1.4 million of state income taxes, net of the federal benefit, and $0.8 million of subpart F income. These expenses were more than offset by $15.0 million of deferred tax liability revaluation, $2.1 million of foreign tax credits, $2.1 million of employment credits, and $0.3 million of other credits.\nThe Fiscal 2016 tax expense was comprised of $12.7 million of income tax expense at the federal statutory rate, $1.3 million of state income taxes, net of the federal benefit, $0.6 million of subpart F income, and $0.4 million of other non-deductible expenses. These expenses were offset by $1.2 million of foreign tax rate differential and $1.8 million of employment credits.\nFiscal 2016 (52 Weeks) Compared to Fiscal 2015 (53 Weeks)\n(dollars in

in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 and a $1.4 million increase in revenue attributable to the 2016 Summer Olympics, offset by the 53rd week impact of $6.8 million, a $4.2 million decrease in comparable restaurant revenue and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $1.4 million. Total comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.6%.\nUS restaurant revenue increased due to a $26.5 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, offset by the 53rd week impact of $6.0 million and a $2.3 million decrease in comparable restaurant revenue. US comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.6%.\nBrazil restaurant revenue decreased due to a $1.9 million decrease in comparable restaurant revenue, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $1.4 million and the 53rd week impact of $0.8 million, offset by a $1.4 million increase in revenue attributable to the 2016 Summer Olympics and a $1.1 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015. Brazil comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.5%.\nOther revenue includes gift card breakage revenue recognized by our US operating segment during Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 related to gift cards whose likelihood of redemption was determined to be remote.\nFood and Beverage Costs\nFood and beverage costs increased due to a $7.5 million increase in food and beverage costs from non-comparable restaurants. However, the increase was offset by a $3.1 million decrease in comparable restaurant food and beverage costs, a $1.8 million reduction due to the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.5 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total food and beverage costs decreased primarily due to reductions in protein commodity pricing, improvements in mix shift with the introduction of seasonal menu offerings and waste reduction efforts.\nCompensation and Benefit Costs\nCompensation and benefit costs increased due to a $9.3 million increase in non-comparable restaurant labor expenses and a $0.2 million increase in comparable restaurant labor expenses, offset by a $1.7 million decrease in cumulative share-based compensation expense primarily recognized in conjunction with the IPO in Fiscal 2015, a $1.4 million reduction due to the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.2 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total compensation and benefits costs increased due to inefficiencies associated with new restaurant openings as our management teams become more accustomed to predicting, managing and servicing the sales volumes of their new restaurants. The increase is also being driven by investments in third managers as well as increases in minimum wages and group health insurance claims.\nOccupancy and Other Operating Expenses\nOccupancy and other operating expenses increased primarily due to a $6.7 million increase in non-comparable restaurant expenses and a $2.0 million increase in comparable restaurant expenses, offset by a $0.6 million reduction due to the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.3 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total occupancy and other operating costs increased as a result of increased fixed occupancy costs on lower revenue.\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nMarketing and advertising costs increased due to a larger revenue base and additional advertising expenses. As a percentage of total revenue, total marketing and advertising expenses were essentially flat.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nGeneral and administrative costs decreased due to the 2015 recognition of cumulative share-based compensation during the second quarter triggered by the IPO in the amount of $4.3 million, as well as a one-time charge of $7.5 million for the disposition of the Advisory Services Agreement with an affiliate of THL in connection with the IPO and a $1.2 million decrease in corporate compensation expense. These decreases were offset by a $0.3 million increase in insurance, a $0.3 million increase in corporate travel and a $0.2 million increase in tax consulting expenses. As a percentage of total revenue, total general and administrative costs decreased as a result of lapping IPO related expenses from Fiscal 2015.\nPre-opening Costs\nPre-opening costs decreased due to the timing of new restaurant development. During Fiscal 2016 we opened four restaurants and had an additional three restaurants under construction at year-end that opened in Fiscal 2017. During Fiscal 2015 we opened seven restaurants and had an additional restaurant under construction at year-end that opened during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 we paid-off our 2012 Credit Facility with the proceeds from the IPO plus proceeds from the 2015 Credit Facility. As a result, we wrote off unamortized loan costs and unamortized original issue discounts, and paid a pre-payment penalty of $0.3 million for a total loss on the extinguishment of $6.0 million.\nNon-cash Impairment Charges\nDuring Fiscal 2016, we recognized a $0.3 million non-cash impairment charge related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in Brazil.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased due to a reduction in the average outstanding principal balance owed and a reduction in interest rates following the extinguishment of the 2012 Credit Facility that occurred during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased due to increased cash and cash equivalents in Brazil and favorable interest rates earned on those balances.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe recognized income tax expense in Fiscal 2016 as compared to an income tax benefit in Fiscal 2015. The increase in income tax expense from Fiscal 2015 is primarily attributable to the change in assertion with respect to undistributed foreign earnings and the release of a valuation allowance during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. We had historically provided deferred taxes under ASC 740-30-25, formerly APB 23, for the presumed repatriation to the US earnings from our Brazilian subsidiaries. In June 2015, we asserted that undistributed net earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries would be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the US. This was primarily driven by a reduction in debt service costs on a forward basis as a result of the IPO. Additionally, future US cash projections and our intent to continue investing in restaurants in foreign jurisdictions with cash generated in those jurisdictions, drove our decision to make the assertion. We also made the decision to release our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset. The decision to release the valuation allowance was triggered in conjunction with the IPO. Reduced debt service costs and historic cumulative earnings (US pretax income plus permanent tax differences) were all sources of positive evidence that led us to believe that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets.\nOur consolidated effective tax rate varies from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to foreign earnings being subjected to taxation at lower tax rates, FICA tax credits, state income taxes, and nondeductible equity-based compensation.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin (collectively, the \"non-GAAP financial measures\"). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP measures used by the Company may be different from the methods used by other companies.\nRestaurant Contribution and Restaurant Contribution Margin\nRestaurant contribution, a non-GAAP financial measure, is equal to revenue generated by our restaurants sales less direct restaurant operating costs (which include food and beverage costs, compensation and benefits costs, and occupancy and certain other operating costs but exclude depreciation and amortization expense). This performance measure includes only the costs that restaurant level managers can directly control and excludes other operating costs that are essential to conduct the Company's business. Depreciation and amortization expense is excluded because it is not an operating cost that can be directly controlled by restaurant level managers. Restaurant contribution margin is equal to restaurant contribution as a percentage of revenue from restaurant sales. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are supplemental measures of operating performance of our restaurants and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to those reported by other companies.\nWe use restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin as key metrics to evaluate the profitability of incremental sales at our restaurants, to evaluate our restaurant performance across periods and to evaluate our restaurant financial performance compared with our competitors. We believe restaurant level operating margin is useful to investors in that it highlights trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent to investors when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. Because other\ncompanies may calculate restaurant level margin differently than we do, restaurant level margin as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nRestaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\nRestaurant Contribution\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of income from operations, which is a GAAP financial measure, to total segment restaurant contribution (dollars in

interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization plus the sum of certain operating and non-operating expenses, including pre-opening costs, losses on modifications and extinguishment of debt, share-based compensation costs, management and consulting fees, non-cash impairment charges, one-time costs associated with the 2015 IPO, retention agreement costs, and other non-cash or similar adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. By monitoring and controlling our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, we can gauge the overall profitability of our company. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin because (i) we believe this measure is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) we believe investors will find this measure useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin internally as a benchmark to compare our performance to that of our competitors.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are (i) it does not reflect our cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, (ii) it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs, (iii) it does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt, (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements, (v) it does not adjust for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows, (vi) it does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations, and (vii) other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Fogo de Ch\u00e3o, Inc.

Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. We calculate constant currency by retranslating results across all prior periods presented using a derived exchange rate for the most current year periods presented based on actual results. The tables set forth below calculate constant currency at a foreign currency exchange rate of 3.1936 Brazilian reals to 1 US dollar, which represents the derived exchange rates for Fiscal 2017, calculated as explained above. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue as reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 314,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 288,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 271,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of foreign currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue at constant currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 314,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 291,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 273,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of foreign currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA at constant currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA margin at constant currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment restaurant contribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of foreign currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment restaurant contribution at constant currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment restaurant contribution margin at constant currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital requirements are principally the build-out cost of new restaurants, renovations of existing restaurants and corporate infrastructure, as well payments of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness and lease obligations. We also require capital resources to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate support and information technology infrastructures. Our main sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operating activities, construction cost contributions from landlords when available to us (also known as tenant improvement allowances) and borrowings under our existing and previous credit facilities.\nThe Company had historically provided deferred taxes under ASC 740-30-25, formerly APB 23, for the presumed repatriation to the US earnings from the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries. In June 2015, the Company asserted that the outside basis difference, including undistributed earnings, of its Brazilian subsidiaries would be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the US. This was primarily driven by a reduction in debt service costs on a go-forward basis as a result of the IPO. The assertion was supported by future US cash projections and the Company's intent to continue using foreign-generated cash to invest in foreign restaurants. As a result of the change in assertion, the Company reduced its deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed foreign earnings by $13.9 million. In 2016, the Company effectuated an internal restructuring whereby it created a new Dutch holding company, FDC Netherlands Co\u00f6peratief U.A. ( Fogo Co-op\u201d) and contributed all of its Brazilian subsidiaries to Fogo Co-op. For US federal income tax purposes, this transaction was structured as a tax-free reorganization. Since the restructuring, Fogo Co-op is treated as the regarded or separate legal entity for US federal income tax purposes and the Brazilian entities are branches or divisions of Fogo Co-op. Consequently, income or losses earned by the Brazilian entities are deemed to be earned by Fogo Co-op for US federal income tax purposes.\nThe Company is not able to determine a reasonable estimate of the deferred tax liability, if any, that would be recorded if the Company were to change its indefinite reinvestment assertion. Missing or incomplete information relevant to this analysis includes tax basis and book basis in the shares of Fogo Co-op. In addition, the undistributed earnings of approximately $51.5 million related to Fogo Co-Op could be subject to state income tax or withholding tax. Pursuant to SAB 118, the Company will continue to apply ASC 740 based on the provisions of the tax law in effect immediately prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, including the historical indefinite reinvestment assertion with respect to the outside basis differences.\nDuring 2018, the Company will analyze the impact of the Tax Act on its indefinite reinvestment assertion. This analysis will consider the impact of previously taxed earnings created under section 965, the application of the new section 245A dividends received deduction, the impact of the new section 951A GILTI tax rules, state law changes, the existence of an outside basis difference in excess of earnings, currency translation adjustment impacts, and shifts in the global business environment resulting from the Tax Act.\nWe intend to spend approximately $27.0 million to $31.0 million in Fiscal 2018 on capital expenditures, net of tenant allowances, including approximately $23.0 million to $25.0 million for new restaurant development and approximately $4.0 million to $6.0 million on opportunistic restaurant remodeling.\nWe believe that our cash from operations and borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our restaurants or systems such as our planned opportunistic restaurant remodel program, which we could fund through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash from operations.\nThe following table presents the primary components of net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated.\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (35,869\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (38,353\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (35,423\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,990\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,011\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of foreign exchange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (515\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,240\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in Fiscal 2017 decreased $0.7 million from Fiscal 2016. The decrease is primarily attributable to a $3.5 million decrease in cash received related to the timing of accounts and other receivables, a $0.7 million increase in cash paid for secondary offering costs, a $0.6 million increase in cash paid interest, a $0.6 million increase in cash paid for inventory, $0.5 million related to duplicate rent costs for the corporate office, and a $0.4 million increase in pre-opening expenses. These decreases to cash were offset by $2.5 million increase in cash related to the timing of payments of liabilities, and a $2.7 million net increase in deferred rent and tenant allowance.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in Fiscal 2016 increased $18.7 million from Fiscal 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to an $8.6 million decrease in cash paid interest, an $8.2 million increase in cash related to the timing of collections of receivables and payments of liabilities, a $1.3 million decrease in pre-opening expenses, and a $0.7 million net increase in deferred revenue\nInvesting Activities\nFor Fiscal 2017, compared to Fiscal 2016, net cash flows used in investing activities decreased by $2.5 million primarily due to timing of capital expenditures related to new restaurant construction.\nFor Fiscal 2016, compared to Fiscal 2015, net cash flows used in investing activities increased by $2.9 million primarily due to timing of capital expenditures related to new restaurant construction.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flows used by financing activities decreased $2.0 million from Fiscal 2016. In Fiscal 2017, the Company made $12.0 million repayments as compared to in Fiscal 2016 the Company made $15.0 million repayments under the 2015 Credit Facility.\nNet cash flows used by financing activities in Fiscal 2016 increased $19.8 million from Fiscal 2015. In Fiscal 2015, the Company generated $259.4 million from the IPO and borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility, offset by the payoff of the 2012 Credit Facility, pre-payment penalty, debt issuance costs and payment of IPO costs. In Fiscal 2016, the Company made $15.0 million repayments under the 2015 Credit Facility.\n2015 Credit Facility\nOn June 24, 2015, in connection with the closing of the IPO, we refinanced our 2012 Credit Facility and entered into the 2015 Credit Facility. Upon the closing of the IPO, we drew $165.0 million on the 2015 Credit Facility and used those borrowings, along with the net proceeds from the IPO, to repay the outstanding debt under the 2012 Credit Facility.\nThe 2015 Credit Facility provides for a $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The loans under the Revolving Credit Facility mature on June 24, 2020.\nAt our option, loans under the Revolving Credit Facility may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans and bear interest at a Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate, respectively, plus the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate\u201d for any Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be between 50 and 150 basis points with respect to Base Rate Loans and between 150 and 250 basis points with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, depending on the Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio. The current Applicable Rate will be (i) in the case of any Base Rate Loan 1.0% and in the case of any Eurodollar Rate Loan, 2.0%.\nThe 2015 Credit Facility contains a number of affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make certain acquisitions, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, and authorize or pay dividends. In addition, we will be required to maintain two financial covenants, which include a maximum Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio (at levels that vary until maturity) and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio. At December 31, 2017, these required ratios were 5.25 to 1 and 2.00 to 1, respectively and the Company was in compliance with those covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had seven letters of credit outstanding for a total of $5.7 million and $106.3 million of available borrowing capacity under the 2015 Credit Facility.\nContractual Obligations\nLeases\nWe lease certain restaurant locations, storage spaces, buildings and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Our restaurant leases generally have initial terms of between 10 and 20 years, and generally can be extended only in five-year increments. Our leases expire at various dates between 2018 and 2033, excluding extensions at our option. Some of our restaurant leases include renewal options, rent abatements and leasehold rental incentives, none of which are reflected in the following table. Some of our leases also include contingent rental payments based on sales volume, the impact of which also are not reflected in the following table.\nDuring Fiscal 2017, we entered into additional leases and exercised an extension on an existing lease, adding estimated minimum future rental payments of approximately $6.7 million attributable to these non-cancelable operating leases.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual arrangements at December 31, 2017 on actual basis and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 1 -\n3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 3 -\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Workers compensation reserve(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligations(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 138,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 138,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Scheduled interest payments(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease (minimum rent)(d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 192,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 347,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 211,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 71,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Estimated future payments attributable to our workers compensation reserve.

These payments, which will be made in the functional currency of the country, have been estimated using the period-end currency exchange rate and the US CPI-U index rate existing at the time of the lease was executed.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including insurance programs and lease obligations. As of December 31, 2017, letters of credit and letters of guaranty totaling $5.7 million have been issued. Other than these standby letters of credit, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts or synthetic leases.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, such as the valuation of long-lived, definite and indefinite-lived assets, estimated useful lives of assets, the reasonably assured lease terms of operating leases, valuation of the workers' compensation and Company-sponsored employee health insurance program liabilities, and deferred tax valuation allowances, that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and that the judgments and estimates are reasonable:\nInsurance Reserves\nBeginning in Fiscal 2013, the Company self-insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation claims and Company-sponsored employee health insurance programs. We estimate the accrued liabilities for all self-insurance programs at the end of each reporting period. Our estimate is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends and actuarial assumptions.\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015, we engaged a third party actuary to assist us in estimating our liability for our workers' compensation claims. We elected to accrue the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims discounted based on the cash flow estimates provided by the actuary. Prior to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015 we did not discount the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims. The discount on the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims as of December 31, 2017 is approximately $0.2 million. We believe that applying a discount to the estimated future cash flows provided by the actuarial analysis results in a more accurate estimate of the liability. The estimated liability for all other self-insurance programs is not discounted. The estimated liability for workers' compensation claims was $1.9 million as of December 31, 2017. The estimated liability for all other self-insurance programs was $0.4 million as of December 31, 2017.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOn a quarterly basis, or as circumstances warrant, we review long-lived assets to determine if triggering events have occurred which would require a test to determine if the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. Assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be separately identified, which is at the individual restaurant level. In the absence of extraordinary events, restaurants are included in our impairment analysis after they have been opened for 36 months. An initial three-year operating plan is developed for each new location and we remain committed to that plan barring unforeseen circumstances.\nDuring December 2017, the Company recognized a $4.2 million non-cash impairment charge related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in the US. The Company continues to evaluate the restaurant's operating performance and its options. A closure of this restaurant could result in a material charge in the period in which the Company ceases operations.\nOur restaurant in San Juan, Puerto Rico re-opened to the public in November 2017. Due to the extended closure, the San Juan location experienced operating losses during the third quarter and into the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017. While we believe these losses are temporary, should indicators suggest a prolonged period of closure and continued losses, this reduction in cash flows could challenge the recovery of carrying value of the restaurants' assets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulting from the acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized. We test our goodwill annually for impairment during the fourth quarter, or more frequently should an event occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Such events or circumstances may be a significant change in business climate, economic and industry trends, legal factors, negative operating performance indicators, significant competition, changes in strategy or disposition of a reporting unit or a portion thereof. We have identified two reporting units, the US and Brazil, based on the geography of the Company's operations to which goodwill is attributable. The impairment evaluation is conducted annually using a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded. In the second step, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for any excess or carrying value over fair value. No impairment to goodwill was recorded during any of the periods presented.\nIntangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. We test our indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment, through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount. The estimated fair value is determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets relate to the assigned value of the Fogo de Ch\u00e3o trade name. Definite-lived intangible assets consist of non-compete agreements. The non-compete agreements are amortized over five years, which is the term of the agreements, and are measured for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in the same manner as long-lived assets. No impairments related to these intangible assets were recorded in any of the periods presented. The term of the non-compete agreements were completed during 2017.\nOperating Leases and Deferred Rent\nWe operate the majority of our restaurants in leased premises. We record the minimum base rents including option periods which in the judgement of management are reasonably assured of renewal. In determining whether an option period is reasonably assured for renewal we consider the capital outlay required for a location and our target return on that investment. For purposes of calculating straight-line rents, the lease term commences on the date we obtain control of the property, which is normally when the property is ready for normal tenant improvements (build-out period). The difference between rent expense and rent paid is recorded as a deferred rent liability. Allowances for tenant improvements are included in the deferred rent liability and recognized over the life of the lease by reducing rent expense.\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act significantly revised the US tax code by, in part but not limited to: a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of US international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. Under Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes, the Company must recognize the effects of tax law changes in the period in which the new legislation is enacted.\nWe calculated an estimate of the impact of the Tax Act in its year-end income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of the Tax Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing. The provisional tax benefit recorded related to the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, was $15.0 million. The provisional tax expense related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was $6.5 million.\nThe Tax Act provides for a one-time transition tax under section 965 on previously untaxed post-1986 foreign income of specified foreign corporations owned by US shareholders by deeming those earnings to be repatriated. Foreign earnings considered held in the form of cash and cash equivalents are taxed at an effective rate of 15.5%, and the remaining earnings are taxed at an effective rate of 8%, which includes a partial participation exemption. We recorded $6.5 million expense related to its one-time repatriation inclusion. As addressed below, this amount is presented as provisional while we continue to review the balance of foreign earnings required to be included under section 965(a).\nWe have historically not utilized a foreign tax credit, instead opting to deduct all foreign taxes paid. In Fiscal 2017, we elected to calculate and utilize a foreign tax credit. We recorded a $2.1 million benefit related to foreign tax credits which includes a credit benefit of $3.3 million net of the $1.1 million Section 78 gross up expense. As addressed below, this amount is presented as provisional while we continue to review its foreign tax pool balance and attributes relevant to the section 904 foreign tax credit limitation.\nThe Tax Act provides for 100% bonus depreciation for eligible property placed in service after September 27, 2017, and before 2023. The Tax Act allows a Company to make an election for the 2017 tax year to apply 50% bonus depreciation rather than 100% bonus depreciation on eligible property. At this time, we plan to elect the 50% bonus depreciation. As addressed below, this amount is presented as provisional while we continue to review the impact of 100% bonus depreciation on its foreign tax credit utilization.\nOn December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") was issued to address the application of US GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. Pursuant to SAB 118, we are presenting the adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities, the liability related to the transition tax, and foreign tax credits as provisional amounts based on information available as of December 31, 2017. As further regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities and as accounting treatment is clarified, additional work may be necessary to ensure earnings as required by the calculations are properly determined. As we perform additional analysis on the application of the law, and as we refine our estimates in calculating the effect, our final analysis may be different from current provisional amounts. Any changes to the provisional amounts will be recognized in the period completed which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. Additionally, as a result of the Tax Act, we have not completed our evaluation of its indefinite reinvestment assertion with regard to foreign earnings under ASC 740-30. As a result, deferred tax liabilities may be increased or decreased during the period allowed under SAB 118.\nThe effects of other provisions of the Tax Act are not expected to have a material impact on our Fiscal 2017 consolidated financial statements. Other provisions of the Tax Act may impact us in Fiscal 2018. These include the new section 951A Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ( GILTI\u201d) anti-deferral rules and the section 245A deduction for certain dividends received from foreign corporations. We have not completed its analysis of the effect of these provisions, hence no estimate can currently be made and no provisional amounts were recorded in the financial statements for the impact of these provisions of the Tax Act. Based on the current interpretation, we may choose a method as an accounting policy to record deferred taxes in relation to the GILTI provisions or to record the tax in the period in which it occurs. Pursuant to SAB 118, we have not elected an accounting policy for the effect of the GILTI tax law provisions.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRecently issued accounting standards not included below are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, an amendment to ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services and expands related disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-10 clarifies ASU 2014-09 to address the potential for diversity in practice at the adoption. ASUs 2016-10 and 2014-09 are effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early application is permitted.\nThe majority of our revenues are from food and beverage sales at our restaurants. ASU 2014-09 will not have an impact on revenue recognition related to food and beverage sales. ASU 2014-09 requires gift card breakage to be recognized as revenue in proportion to the pattern of gift card redemptions exercised by our customers. Currently, the Company records breakage income within other revenue.\nThe new guidance may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings as of the date of adoption (modified retrospective approach). We have elected the modified retrospective adoption method and plan to adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company has evaluated the impact of adoption on the recognition of license fee and other income related to the Company's joint ventures and does not believe the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This guidance requires the recognition of most leases on the balance sheet to give investors, lenders, and other financial statement users a more comprehensive view of a company's long-term financial obligations as well as the assets it owns versus leases. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Currently, all of our restaurant and our restaurant support center leases are accounted for as operating leases, and therefore are not recorded within our balance sheet. We expect this adoption will result in a material increase in the assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, but will likely have an insignificant impact on our consolidated statements of earnings. In preparation for the adoption of the guidance, we are implementing controls and key system changes to enable the preparation of financial information.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which provides financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To achieve this, the amendments in this ASU replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The measurement of expected credit losses will be based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The amendments in this ASU will be applied using a modified-retrospective approach and, for public entities, are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company has not yet evaluated the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,\u201d which clarifies and provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues that are not currently addressed by current GAAP. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-15 effective Fiscal 2018. Upon adoption there will be no impact on the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350).\u201d ASU 2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test. The amendment requires an entity to perform its annual, or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. A goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nJOBS Act\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if we comply with the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth from time to time, we may avail ourselves of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we are choosing to opt out of any extended transition period, and as a result we will seek to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company\u201d for up to five years following the completion of our initial public offering which will be June 2020, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d section of this annual report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions described in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this annual report and included elsewhere in this annual report. Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section and included elsewhere in this annual report.\nIn this section and other parts of this Form 10-K, we refer to certain measures used for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We also may refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), but have corresponding GAAP-based measures. Where non-GAAP measures appear, we provide tables reconciling these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP-based measures and make reference to a discussion of their use. We believe these measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making.\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday that is closest to December 31 of that year. Each fiscal year generally comprises four 13-week fiscal quarters, although in the years with 53 weeks the fourth quarter represents a 14-week period. References to Fiscal 2017 relate to our 52-week fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. References to Fiscal 2016 relate to our 52-week fiscal year ended January 1, 2017. References to Fiscal 2015 relate to our 53-week fiscal year ended January 3, 2016.\nOverview\nFogo de Ch\u00e3o (fogo-dee-shoun) is a leading Brazilian steakhouse, or churrascaria, which has specialized for nearly 40 years in fire-roasting high-quality meats utilizing the centuries-old Southern Brazilian cooking technique of churrasco. We deliver a distinctive and authentic Brazilian dining experience through the combination of our high-quality Brazilian cuisine and our differentiated service model known as espeto corrido (Portuguese for continuous service\u201d) delivered by our churrasqueiros, which we refer to as our gaucho chefs. We offer our guests a variety of menu choices including our most popular offering the Full Churrasco Experience as well Gaucho Lunch, Weekend Brazilian Brunch and Bar Fogo menu items. The Full Churrasco Experience, our prix fixe menu, provides the opportunity to experience a variety of meats including beef, lamb, pork and chicken, simply seasoned and carefully fire-roasted to expose their natural flavors as well as a selection of fresh seasonal salads and specialty items at the Market Table.\nGrowth Strategies and Outlook\nOur growth is based on the following strategies:\n \u2022 Grow our restaurant base; \n \u2022 Grow our comparable restaurant sales; and \n \u2022 Improve margins by leveraging our infrastructure and investments in human capital. \nWe believe we are in the early stages of our growth with 50 current restaurants, 38 in the US, nine in Brazil and three international joint venture restaurants. Based on internal analysis and a study prepared by an independent third party, we believe there is a long-term growth potential for more than 100 domestic sites, with additional new restaurants internationally. We have a long track record of successful new restaurant development, having grown our restaurant count by a multiple of 10 since 2000, and at a 12.4% CAGR since 2010. While new restaurants are expected to be a key driver of our growth, we believe positive comparable restaurant sales growth and margin expansion through leveraging our infrastructure will also contribute to future growth.\nHighlights and Trends\nRestaurant Development\nRestaurant openings reflect the number of new restaurants opened during a particular reporting period. During Fiscal 2017 we opened our third international joint venture restaurant in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Over the next five years, we plan to increase our company-owned restaurant count by at least 10% annually, with North America being our primary market for new restaurant development. In addition, over the next five years, we plan to opportunistically open new restaurants in Brazil as attractive real estate locations become available. We will pursue growth in international markets through a combination of company-owned restaurants and joint ventures, which we believe allows us to expand our brand with limited capital investment by us. The actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control including, but not limited to, weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant Activity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning of Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Openings(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Closings(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurants at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) We opened our first Middle East JV restaurant in August 2017.

The restaurant was fully impaired as of January 1, 2017. \nKey Events\nMerger Agreement with Rh\u00f4ne\nOn February 20, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) among Prime Cut Intermediate Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Parent\u201d) and an investment entity affiliated with Rh\u00f4ne Capital V L.P. ( Rh\u00f4ne\u201d) and Prime Cut Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( Merger Subsidiary\u201d), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into the Company, which will survive as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent will finance the Merger with a combination of debt and equity financing.\nAt the effective time of the Merger,\n \u2022 each share of the Company's common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive $15.75 in cash, without interest; \n \u2022 each Company outstanding stock option will be cancelled, with the holder of such stock option becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (a) $15.75 minus (b) the exercise price per share of common stock subject to such stock option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of common stock subject to such stock option; and \n \u2022 the restrictions on each Company outstanding restricted stock will lapse, with the holder of such performance-based restricted stock becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) $15.75 multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of common stock subject to such restricted stock. \nFollowing execution of the Merger Agreement, certain affiliates and co-investors of Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. and certain directors and executive officers of the Company, who collectively hold approximately 61.56% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock of the Company, executed and delivered to the Company a written consent adopting the Merger Agreement. The Merger cannot be consummated until the passing of 20 calendar days from the date on which the Company mails to the Company's stockholders an information statement describing the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on Schedule 14C under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Following delivery of the written consent, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company may not engage in any further discussions or solicitations regarding the potential acquisition of the Company by any third party, and the Company has no ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into an alternative transaction.\nThe completion of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including, without limitation, (1) the absence of any restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other court order or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the Merger, (2) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (3) subject to certain qualifications, the accuracy of representations and warranties of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary, and (4) the performance in all material respects of the obligations of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary, respectively. The Merger is not subject to a financing condition. Completion of the Merger is expected early in the second fiscal quarter of 2018.\nNatural Disasters\nDuring the third quarter of Fiscal 2017, our operations were impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria which struck the US mainland and Puerto Rico adversely affecting 10 of our US restaurants. Most of the affected restaurants were minimally impacted, however four restaurants were significantly impacted requiring them to close for multiple days. These closures extended prior to landfall through the post-hurricane clean up periods. The US mainland restaurants returned to operations within a week of the hurricanes, with sales exceeding expectations for the remainder of Fiscal 2017. Our restaurant in San Juan, Puerto Rico re-opened mid-November 2017 with sales also exceeding our expectations for the remainder of Fiscal 2017. We maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our restaurants including property, flood and business interruption. Initial assessments have found minimal structural and cosmetic damage to the restaurants; however we are working with our insurance providers to assess the overall impact from the hurricanes and expect that process to take some time. As a result of the hurricane activity, we estimate total revenue was negatively impacted by $1.6 million for Fiscal 2017. We expect to recover a portion of the lost income through insurance recoveries in Fiscal 2018. The Company has not recorded any gains related to insurance recoveries during Fiscal 2017.\nIn addition, operations of our Mexican JV were impacted by multiple major earthquakes that affected the greater Mexico City metropolitan area. Our two restaurants in Mexico City sustained minimal cosmetic damage and we believe no structural damage. To date, we have not experienced a loss of operating days as a result of the earthquakes.\nSecondary Offering\nOn May 17, 2017, we completed a secondary offering of 5,175,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $14.00 per share, which included 675,000 shares sold to the underwriters pursuant to their over-allotment option. As all of these shares were offered by certain selling stockholders we did not receive any proceeds from the offering.\n2016 Summer Olympics\nRio de Janeiro hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics which were held during the third quarter of Fiscal 2016. As a result, we estimate our two Rio de Janeiro restaurants contributed approximately $1.4 million of incremental revenue in the third quarter of Fiscal 2016.\nRecent Events in Brazil\nBrazil's political environment has historically influenced, and continues to influence, the performance of the country's economy. Starting in 2015 a series of protests began in Brazil against the Brazilian government and its President. The initial protests occurred in cities throughout Brazil, including Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paolo, and continued throughout the remainder of 2015, culminating in the impeachment of the President of Brazil in 2016. After a somewhat successful start to the new President's administration, their proposed pension overhaul faced significant opposition with protests occurring in a number of cities in response to the government's austerity plans. The new administration also endured a number of scandals emerging from ongoing anti-corruption campaign which ultimately led to the current President's indictment on corruption charges in June 2017. In August 2017, Brazil's Lower House of government voted against sending the trial to Brazil's Supreme Court; however, a second round of corruption charges were leveled against the current President, whose term is due to end in October 2018, in September 2017. The protests and political unrest contributed to lower guest traffic in our restaurants in Brazil, in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2017. Additionally, growing security concerns are affecting guest traffic in our two Rio de Janeiro restaurants. While we believe these issues are temporary, should indicators suggest a permanent reduction in guest traffic and cash flows due to the prolonged unrest, the recovery of carrying value of certain Brazilian assets could be challenged.\nIn addition to the uncertain political environment, Brazil continues to suffer from a protracted economic recession that is negatively impacting our guests. Although we believe Fiscal 2017 represents an inflection point for the Brazilian economy, as supported by improving economic forecasts, political turbulence continues to cast a long shadow on the strength of the recovery. Nevertheless, we believe Brazil's economy will likely continue recovering as we lap the economic recession. With our focus on US development, Brazil will continue becoming a smaller portion of the overall business, representing less than 15% of our consolidated revenue base for the second half of Fiscal 2017.\nBrazilian legislation regulating the collection of tips in commercial establishments was approved by the President of Brazil and became effective on May 13, 2017. We have implemented new procedures intended to facilitate our compliance with the new tip legislation, however, we cannot predict whether our procedures will fully comply with any regulations that may be adopted in furtherance of the legislation or judicial determinations as to the requirements of the legislation. Additionally, comprehensive labor reform legislation became effective in November 2017. We anticipate that the new laws will be tested in Brazilian courts. We are attempting to implement the changes required under the new laws, but cannot predict the potential impact of the new laws, or judicial interpretation of such laws, on our business or prospective results of operations.\nTax Law Changes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law by President Trump. The Tax Act significantly revised the US corporate income tax regime by, among other things, lowering the US corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also repealing the deduction for domestic production activities, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. US GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $15.0 million due to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and a tax charge of $6.5 million due to the transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, in the three months ended December 31, 2017. Both of the tax benefit and the tax charge represent provisional amounts and the Company's current best estimates. Any adjustments recorded to the provisional amounts through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 will be included in income from operations as an adjustment to tax expense. The provisional amounts incorporate assumptions made based upon the Company's current interpretation of the Tax Act and may change as the Company receives additional clarification and implementation guidance.\nCommodity Pricing\nWe experienced lower and stable beef prices in Fiscal 2017, which allowed us to offset inflation on food costs and other meats as compared to Fiscal 2016. Prices at food-at-home outlets have posted lower year-over-year price increases, and supermarket prices decreased for the second year in a row, falling approximately 0.2 percent. Inflation has been lower than average due, in part, to a stronger US dollar.\nExchange Rate Impact\nWe experienced significant foreign currency improvement from Fiscal 2016 to Fiscal 2017 due to fluctuations of the Brazilian Real relative to the US dollar. When the Brazilian Real strengthens compared to the US dollar, it has a positive impact on our Brazilian operating results upon translation of those results into US dollars for the purposes of consolidation. We anticipate foreign currency to stabilize throughout Fiscal 2018 with respect to the Brazilian Real. See Supplemental Selected Constant Currency Information\u201d on page 60 for the exchange rate impact on current financial periods.\nPerformance Indicators\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures we use for determining how our business is performing are the number of new restaurant openings, comparable restaurant sales, restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP measures. See page 56 for discussion of non-GAAP financial measures.\nNew Restaurant Openings\nOur ability to successfully open new restaurants and expand our restaurant base is critical to adding revenue capacity to meet our goals for growth. New restaurant openings contribute additional operating weeks and revenue to our business. Before a new restaurant opens, we incur pre-opening costs, as described below. New restaurants often open with an initial start-up period of sales volatility. Operating margins tend to stabilize within twelve months of opening. New restaurants typically experience normal inefficiencies in the form of higher food, labor and other direct operating expenses and, as a result, restaurant contribution margins are generally lower during the start-up period of operation. To achieve our goal to successfully open new restaurants, we consider a number of factors including macro and micro economic conditions, availability of appropriate locations, competition in local markets, and the availability of teams to manage new locations. The actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of our control including, but not limited to, weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.\nComparable Restaurant Sales\nWe consider a restaurant to be comparable during the first full fiscal quarter following the eighteenth full month of operations. We adjust the sales included in the comparable restaurant calculation for restaurant closures, primarily as a result of remodels, so that the periods will be comparable. Changes in comparable restaurant sales reflect changes in sales for the comparable group of restaurants over a specified period of time. Changes in comparable sales reflect changes in guest count trends as well as changes in average check per person, as described below. This measure highlights performance of existing restaurants, as the impact of new restaurant openings is excluded. The Company uses a 52/53 week fiscal year convention. For fiscal years following a 53 week year the Company calculates comparable restaurant sales using the most comparable calendar week to the current reporting period.\nAverage Check Per Person\nAverage check per person is calculated by dividing total comparable restaurant sales by comparable restaurant guest counts for a given time period. Average check per person is influenced by menu prices and menu mix. Management uses this indicator to analyze trends in guests' preferences, the effectiveness of menu offerings and per guest expenditures.\nAverage Unit Volumes\nWe measure average unit volumes ( AUVs\u201d) on an annual (52-week) basis. In fiscal years with 53 weeks, we exclude the 53rd week from the AUV calculation for consistency purposes. AUVs consist of the average sales of all restaurants that have been open for a trailing 52-week period or longer. We adjust the sales included in AUV calculations for restaurant closures. This measurement allows us to assess changes in consumer spending patterns at our restaurants and the overall performance of our restaurant base.\nGuest Counts\nGuest counts are measured by the number of entr\u00e9es ordered at our restaurants over a given time period. Examples of our entr\u00e9es include our Full Churrasco Experience, \u00e0 la carte seafood items, and Gaucho Lunch.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of our Operating Results\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act significantly revised the US tax code by, in part but not limited to: a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of US international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. Under Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes, the Company must recognize the effects of tax law changes in the period in which the new legislation is enacted.\n52 vs. 53 Week Fiscal Year\nFiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 contained 52 weeks whereas Fiscal 2015 contained 53 weeks. We estimate the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 contributed approximately $6.8 million of incremental revenue, as compared to Fiscal 2016. While certain expenses that were directly related to the incremental revenue increased, other expenses, such as fixed costs, were incurred on a calendar basis.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn June 24, 2015, we completed our initial public offering (\"IPO\") of 5,073,528 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $20.00 per share, which included 661,764 shares of common stock sold to the underwriters pursuant to their option to purchase additional shares. After underwriters' discounts and commissions and offering costs, we received net proceeds from the IPO of $91.3 million. Proceeds from the IPO, together with borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility, were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our 2012 Credit Facility.\nCertain share-based awards granted from 2012 through 2015 include vesting conditions that require both (i) completion of a four or five-year vesting period and (ii) satisfaction of a Liquidity Event, as defined in the applicable award agreement. Under the terms of those agreements, a Liquidity Event is defined as the earlier to occur of (i) a change in control transaction or (ii) an initial public offering. Upon the closing of the IPO, options for the purchase of 783,606 shares of common stock vested as a result of the satisfaction of the Liquidity Event vesting condition. The Company recognized $5.7 million of compensation expense associated with these options during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\nTermination of the Advisory Services Agreement\nAs a result of the IPO, we terminated our Advisory Services Agreement with an affiliate of Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. and paid a one-time non-recurring payment of $7.5 million in connection with the termination during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. While we have benefitted from savings on management fees that we incurred as a private company, these benefits have been offset by the incremental costs we incurred as a public company such as legal, accounting, insurance and other compliance costs.\n2015 Credit Facility\nConcurrently with the consummation of our IPO, we refinanced our 2012 Credit Facility and entered into a new $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the 2015 Credit Facility\u201d). Loans under the 2015 Credit Facility bear interest at a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.50% or at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.50% and will mature in 2020. The 2015 Credit Facility contains customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries, including financial maintenance covenants requiring us to maintain a maximum Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (each as defined in the underlying credit facility agreement). Starting in Fiscal 2017 and through Fiscal 2018, the Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio may not be greater than 5.25 to 1 and the ratio will further reduce to 5.0 to 1 in Fiscal 2019, through maturity. The Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio may not be less than 2.00 to 1. Borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility may vary significantly from time to time depending on our cash needs at any given time. Upon the consummation of our IPO we drew $165.0 million under the 2015 Credit Facility and used those borrowings, along with the net proceeds from our IPO, to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the 2012 Credit Facility. We recorded a loss of $6.0 million on the extinguishment of the 2012 Credit Facility during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\nStock Split\nIn connection with the closing of the IPO, we effected a stock split pursuant to which each share held by the holder of common stock was reclassified into 25.4588 shares. All share and per share data have been retroactively restated to give effect to the stock split.\nSignificant Components of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nRevenue primarily consists of food and beverage sales, net of any employee meals and complimentary meals. Revenue is recognized when food and beverage products are sold at our restaurants net of any discounts. Revenue in a given period is directly influenced by the number of operating weeks in such period, the number of restaurants we operate and comparable restaurant sales growth. Proceeds from the sale of gift cards that do not have expiration dates are recorded as deferred revenue at the time of the sale and recognized as revenue when the gift card is redeemed by the holder. The portion of gift cards sold which are never redeemed is commonly referred to as gift card breakage. We recognize gift card breakage revenue for gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and we determine there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to governmental agencies.\nFood and Beverage Costs\nFood and beverage costs include the direct costs associated with food, beverage and distribution of our menu items. We measure food and beverage costs by tracking the cost as a percentage of revenue. Food and beverage costs as a percentage of revenue are generally influenced by the cost of food and beverage items, distribution costs and sales mix. These components are variable in nature, increase with revenue, are subject to increases or decreases based on fluctuations in commodity costs, including beef, lamb, pork, chicken and seafood prices, and depend in part on the controls we have in place to manage costs at our restaurants.\nCompensation and Benefit Costs\nCompensation and benefits costs comprise restaurant and regional management salaries and bonuses, hourly staff payroll and other payroll-related expenses, including bonus expenses, share-based compensation, vacation pay, payroll taxes, fringe benefits and health insurance expenses and are measured by tracking hourly and total labor as a percentage of revenue.\nOccupancy and Other Operating Expenses\nOccupancy and other operating expenses comprise all occupancy costs, consisting of both fixed and variable portions of rent, common area maintenance charges, utility costs, credit card fees, real estate property and other related taxes and other related restaurant supply and occupancy costs, but exclude depreciation and amortization expense, and are measured by tracking occupancy and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nMarketing and advertising costs include all media, production and related costs for both local restaurant advertising and national marketing. We measure the efficiency of our marketing and advertising expenditures by tracking these costs as a percentage of total revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nGeneral and administrative costs are comprised of costs related to certain corporate and administrative functions that support development and restaurant operations. These expenses are generally fixed and reflect management, supervisory and staff salaries, employee benefits and bonuses, share-based compensation, travel expense, information systems, training, corporate rent, technology, market research, and professional and consulting fees, including fees related to the implementation of, and compliance with, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We measure general and administrative costs by tracking general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue.\nPre-opening Costs\nPre-opening costs are costs incurred prior to, and directly associated with, opening a restaurant, and primarily consist of manager salaries, relocation costs, recruiting expenses, employee payroll and related training costs for new employees, including rehearsal of service activities, as well as straight-line lease costs incurred prior to opening. In addition, pre-opening costs include public relations costs incurred prior to opening. We typically start incurring pre-opening costs four to six months prior to opening and these costs tend to increase four weeks prior to opening as we begin training activities.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and certain definite life intangible assets. We depreciate capitalized leasehold improvements over the shorter of the total expected lease term or their estimated useful life.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we operate. Historically we have generated taxable income in the US and Brazil. Our provision includes federal, state and local, and foreign current and deferred income tax expense.\nSegment Reporting\nWe operate our restaurants using a single restaurant concept and brand. Each restaurant under our single global brand operates with similar types of products and menu, providing a continuous service style, similar contracts, customers and employees, irrespective of location. We have identified two operating segments: US and Brazil, which is how we organize our restaurants for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Our joint venture in Mexico is included in the US for segment reporting purposes as the operations of the joint venture are monitored by the US segment management. License fee revenue, store opening fee and country development fee revenue attributable to our joint venture in the Middle East JV is included in other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize key components of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a

As a percentage of total revenue, total food and beverage costs remained flat in spite of new restaurant openings and the impact of the hurricanes, somewhat offset by reduced liquor and desserts costs in Brazil.\nCompensation and Benefit Costs\nCompensation and benefit costs increased due to a $7.7 million increase in non-comparable restaurant labor expense, a $0.7 million increase in comparable restaurant labor expense and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $0.5 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total compensation and benefits costs increased as a result of wage rate inflation in the US and Brazil in addition to inefficiencies associated with new restaurant openings, marginally offset by lower insurance costs.\nOccupancy and Other Operating Expenses\nOccupancy and other operating expenses increased due to a $5.7 million increase in non-comparable restaurant operating expenses, a $0.9 million increase in comparable restaurant operating expenses, and an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of $0.7 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total occupancy and other operating costs increased due to higher costs of rent as a percentage of sales in our new restaurants as these stores are in the early stages of their revenue growth curve, the timing of restaurant repairs, and local commercial rent taxes.\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nMarketing and advertising costs increased due to a refreshed advertising campaign during Fiscal 2017 as well as an increase in brand awareness advertising. As a percentage of total revenue, marketing and advertising costs increased marginally.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nGeneral and administrative costs increased due to a $1.6 million increase in corporate compensation as a result of additional headcount in the US, $0.7 million in expenses related to our secondary offering in the second quarter of Fiscal 2017, $0.4 million in concurrent corporate office rents as we transition to our new corporate office space, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $0.2 million and a $0.1 million donation to the Houston Food Bank in relation to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. These increases were offset by a decrease of $0.3 million in stock compensation expense. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative costs increased 0.3%.\nPre-opening Costs\nPre-opening costs increased due to the timing of new restaurant development. During Fiscal 2017 we opened five US restaurants and had an additional three restaurants under construction at year-end that are due to open in Fiscal 2018. During Fiscal 2016 we opened three US restaurants and had an additional three restaurants under construction at year-end that opened during the first half of Fiscal 2017.\nNon-cash Impairment Charges\nDuring Fiscal 2017, we recognized $4.2 million in non-cash impairment charges related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in the US. The Company continues to evaluate the restaurant's operating performance and its options. A closure of this restaurant could result in a material charge in the period in which the Company ceases operations. During Fiscal 2016, we recognized $0.3 million in non-cash impairment charges related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in Brazil. The lease for this underperforming restaurant in Brazil expired in September 2017 and was not renewed.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased slightly due to a 0.6% increase in the interest rate on our 2015 Credit Facility, which was alleviated marginally by a decrease in the average outstanding balance.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased due to increased cash and cash equivalents in Brazil and favorable interest rates earned on those balances.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act significantly revised the US tax code by, in part but not limited to: a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of US international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. Under Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes, the Company must recognize the effects of tax law changes in the period in which the new legislation is enacted.\nThe Fiscal 2017 income tax benefit was primarily comprised of $9.4 million of income tax expense at the federal statutory rate, $6.5 million expense related to its one-time repatriation inclusion, $1.4 million of state income taxes, net of the federal benefit, and $0.8 million of subpart F income. These expenses were more than offset by $15.0 million of deferred tax liability revaluation, $2.1 million of foreign tax credits, $2.1 million of employment credits, and $0.3 million of other credits.\nThe Fiscal 2016 tax expense was comprised of $12.7 million of income tax expense at the federal statutory rate, $1.3 million of state income taxes, net of the federal benefit, $0.6 million of subpart F income, and $0.4 million of other non-deductible expenses. These expenses were offset by $1.2 million of foreign tax rate differential and $1.8 million of employment credits.\nFiscal 2016 (52 Weeks) Compared to Fiscal 2015 (53 Weeks)\n(dollars in

Calculated increase / (decrease) in percentage of total revenue. \n * Not meaningful. \nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased due to a $27.6 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 and a $1.4 million increase in revenue attributable to the 2016 Summer Olympics, offset by the 53rd week impact of $6.8 million, a $4.2 million decrease in comparable restaurant revenue and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $1.4 million. Total comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.6%.\nUS restaurant revenue increased due to a $26.5 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, offset by the 53rd week impact of $6.0 million and a $2.3 million decrease in comparable restaurant revenue. US comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.6%.\nBrazil restaurant revenue decreased due to a $1.9 million decrease in comparable restaurant revenue, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $1.4 million and the 53rd week impact of $0.8 million, offset by a $1.4 million increase in revenue attributable to the 2016 Summer Olympics and a $1.1 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015. Brazil comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.5%.\nOther revenue includes gift card breakage revenue recognized by our US operating segment during Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 related to gift cards whose likelihood of redemption was determined to be remote.\nFood and Beverage Costs\nFood and beverage costs increased due to a $7.5 million increase in food and beverage costs from non-comparable restaurants. However, the increase was offset by a $3.1 million decrease in comparable restaurant food and beverage costs, a $1.8 million reduction due to the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.5 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total food and beverage costs decreased primarily due to reductions in protein commodity pricing, improvements in mix shift with the introduction of seasonal menu offerings and waste reduction efforts.\nCompensation and Benefit Costs\nCompensation and benefit costs increased due to a $9.3 million increase in non-comparable restaurant labor expenses and a $0.2 million increase in comparable restaurant labor expenses, offset by a $1.7 million decrease in cumulative share-based compensation expense primarily recognized in conjunction with the IPO in Fiscal 2015, a $1.4 million reduction due to the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.2 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total compensation and benefits costs increased due to inefficiencies associated with new restaurant openings as our management teams become more accustomed to predicting, managing and servicing the sales volumes of their new restaurants. The increase is also being driven by investments in third managers as well as increases in minimum wages and group health insurance claims.\nOccupancy and Other Operating Expenses\nOccupancy and other operating expenses increased primarily due to a $6.7 million increase in non-comparable restaurant expenses and a $2.0 million increase in comparable restaurant expenses, offset by a $0.6 million reduction due to the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.3 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total occupancy and other operating costs increased as a result of increased fixed occupancy costs on lower revenue.\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nMarketing and advertising costs increased due to a larger revenue base and additional advertising expenses. As a percentage of total revenue, total marketing and advertising expenses were essentially flat.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nGeneral and administrative costs decreased due to the 2015 recognition of cumulative share-based compensation during the second quarter triggered by the IPO in the amount of $4.3 million, as well as a one-time charge of $7.5 million for the disposition of the Advisory Services Agreement with an affiliate of THL in connection with the IPO and a $1.2 million decrease in corporate compensation expense. These decreases were offset by a $0.3 million increase in insurance, a $0.3 million increase in corporate travel and a $0.2 million increase in tax consulting expenses. As a percentage of total revenue, total general and administrative costs decreased as a result of lapping IPO related expenses from Fiscal 2015.\nPre-opening Costs\nPre-opening costs decreased due to the timing of new restaurant development. During Fiscal 2016 we opened four restaurants and had an additional three restaurants under construction at year-end that opened in Fiscal 2017. During Fiscal 2015 we opened seven restaurants and had an additional restaurant under construction at year-end that opened during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 we paid-off our 2012 Credit Facility with the proceeds from the IPO plus proceeds from the 2015 Credit Facility. As a result, we wrote off unamortized loan costs and unamortized original issue discounts, and paid a pre-payment penalty of $0.3 million for a total loss on the extinguishment of $6.0 million.\nNon-cash Impairment Charges\nDuring Fiscal 2016, we recognized a $0.3 million non-cash impairment charge related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in Brazil.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased due to a reduction in the average outstanding principal balance owed and a reduction in interest rates following the extinguishment of the 2012 Credit Facility that occurred during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased due to increased cash and cash equivalents in Brazil and favorable interest rates earned on those balances.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe recognized income tax expense in Fiscal 2016 as compared to an income tax benefit in Fiscal 2015. The increase in income tax expense from Fiscal 2015 is primarily attributable to the change in assertion with respect to undistributed foreign earnings and the release of a valuation allowance during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. We had historically provided deferred taxes under ASC 740-30-25, formerly APB 23, for the presumed repatriation to the US earnings from our Brazilian subsidiaries. In June 2015, we asserted that undistributed net earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries would be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the US. This was primarily driven by a reduction in debt service costs on a forward basis as a result of the IPO. Additionally, future US cash projections and our intent to continue investing in restaurants in foreign jurisdictions with cash generated in those jurisdictions, drove our decision to make the assertion. We also made the decision to release our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset. The decision to release the valuation allowance was triggered in conjunction with the IPO. Reduced debt service costs and historic cumulative earnings (US pretax income plus permanent tax differences) were all sources of positive evidence that led us to believe that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets.\nOur consolidated effective tax rate varies from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to foreign earnings being subjected to taxation at lower tax rates, FICA tax credits, state income taxes, and nondeductible equity-based compensation.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin (collectively, the \"non-GAAP financial measures\"). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP measures used by the Company may be different from the methods used by other companies.\nRestaurant Contribution and Restaurant Contribution Margin\nRestaurant contribution, a non-GAAP financial measure, is equal to revenue generated by our restaurants sales less direct restaurant operating costs (which include food and beverage costs, compensation and benefits costs, and occupancy and certain other operating costs but exclude depreciation and amortization expense). This performance measure includes only the costs that restaurant level managers can directly control and excludes other operating costs that are essential to conduct the Company's business. Depreciation and amortization expense is excluded because it is not an operating cost that can be directly controlled by restaurant level managers. Restaurant contribution margin is equal to restaurant contribution as a percentage of revenue from restaurant sales. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are supplemental measures of operating performance of our restaurants and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to those reported by other companies.\nWe use restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin as key metrics to evaluate the profitability of incremental sales at our restaurants, to evaluate our restaurant performance across periods and to evaluate our restaurant financial performance compared with our competitors. We believe restaurant level operating margin is useful to investors in that it highlights trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent to investors when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. Because other\ncompanies may calculate restaurant level margin differently than we do, restaurant level margin as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nRestaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\nRestaurant Contribution\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of income from operations, which is a GAAP financial measure, to total segment restaurant contribution (dollars in thousands).\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td>

certain operating and non-operating expenses, including pre-opening costs, losses on modifications and extinguishment of debt, share-based compensation costs, management and consulting fees, non-cash impairment charges, one-time costs associated with the 2015 IPO, retention agreement costs, and other non-cash or similar adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. By monitoring and controlling our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, we can gauge the overall profitability of our company. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin because (i) we believe this measure is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) we believe investors will find this measure useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin internally as a benchmark to compare our performance to that of our competitors.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are (i) it does not reflect our cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, (ii) it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs, (iii) it does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt, (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements, (v) it does not adjust for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows, (vi) it does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations, and (vii) other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Fogo de Ch\u00e3o, Inc.

Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. We calculate constant currency by retranslating results across all prior periods presented using a derived exchange rate for the most current year periods presented based on actual results. The tables set forth below calculate constant currency at a foreign currency exchange rate of 3.1936 Brazilian reals to 1 US dollar, which represents the derived exchange rates for Fiscal 2017, calculated as explained above. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue as reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 314,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 288,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 271,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of foreign currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue at constant currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 314,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 291,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 273,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of foreign currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA at constant currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA margin at constant currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment restaurant contribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of foreign currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment restaurant contribution at constant currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment restaurant contribution margin at constant currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital requirements are principally the build-out cost of new restaurants, renovations of existing restaurants and corporate infrastructure, as well payments of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness and lease obligations. We also require capital resources to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate support and information technology infrastructures. Our main sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operating activities, construction cost contributions from landlords when available to us (also known as tenant improvement allowances) and borrowings under our existing and previous credit facilities.\nThe Company had historically provided deferred taxes under ASC 740-30-25, formerly APB 23, for the presumed repatriation to the US earnings from the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries. In June 2015, the Company asserted that the outside basis difference, including undistributed earnings, of its Brazilian subsidiaries would be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the US. This was primarily driven by a reduction in debt service costs on a go-forward basis as a result of the IPO. The assertion was supported by future US cash projections and the Company's intent to continue using foreign-generated cash to invest in foreign restaurants. As a result of the change in assertion, the Company reduced its deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed foreign earnings by $13.9 million. In 2016, the Company effectuated an internal restructuring whereby it created a new Dutch holding company, FDC Netherlands Co\u00f6peratief U.A. ( Fogo Co-op\u201d) and contributed all of its Brazilian subsidiaries to Fogo Co-op. For US federal income tax purposes, this transaction was structured as a tax-free reorganization. Since the restructuring, Fogo Co-op is treated as the regarded or separate legal entity for US federal income tax purposes and the Brazilian entities are branches or divisions of Fogo Co-op. Consequently, income or losses earned by the Brazilian entities are deemed to be earned by Fogo Co-op for US federal income tax purposes.\nThe Company is not able to determine a reasonable estimate of the deferred tax liability, if any, that would be recorded if the Company were to change its indefinite reinvestment assertion. Missing or incomplete information relevant to this analysis includes tax basis and book basis in the shares of Fogo Co-op. In addition, the undistributed earnings of approximately $51.5 million related to Fogo Co-Op could be subject to state income tax or withholding tax. Pursuant to SAB 118, the Company will continue to apply ASC 740 based on the provisions of the tax law in effect immediately prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, including the historical indefinite reinvestment assertion with respect to the outside basis differences.\nDuring 2018, the Company will analyze the impact of the Tax Act on its indefinite reinvestment assertion. This analysis will consider the impact of previously taxed earnings created under section 965, the application of the new section 245A dividends received deduction, the impact of the new section 951A GILTI tax rules, state law changes, the existence of an outside basis difference in excess of earnings, currency translation adjustment impacts, and shifts in the global business environment resulting from the Tax Act.\nWe intend to spend approximately $27.0 million to $31.0 million in Fiscal 2018 on capital expenditures, net of tenant allowances, including approximately $23.0 million to $25.0 million for new restaurant development and approximately $4.0 million to $6.0 million on opportunistic restaurant remodeling.\nWe believe that our cash from operations and borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our restaurants or systems such as our planned opportunistic restaurant remodel program, which we could fund through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash from operations.\nThe following table presents the primary components of net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated.\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (35,869\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (38,353\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (35,423\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,990\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,011\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of foreign exchange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (515\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,240\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in Fiscal 2017 decreased $0.7 million from Fiscal 2016. The decrease is primarily attributable to a $3.5 million decrease in cash received related to the timing of accounts and other receivables, a $0.7 million increase in cash paid for secondary offering costs, a $0.6 million increase in cash paid interest, a $0.6 million increase in cash paid for inventory, $0.5 million related to duplicate rent costs for the corporate office, and a $0.4 million increase in pre-opening expenses. These decreases to cash were offset by $2.5 million increase in cash related to the timing of payments of liabilities, and a $2.7 million net increase in deferred rent and tenant allowance.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in Fiscal 2016 increased $18.7 million from Fiscal 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to an $8.6 million decrease in cash paid interest, an $8.2 million increase in cash related to the timing of collections of receivables and payments of liabilities, a $1.3 million decrease in pre-opening expenses, and a $0.7 million net increase in deferred revenue\nInvesting Activities\nFor Fiscal 2017, compared to Fiscal 2016, net cash flows used in investing activities decreased by $2.5 million primarily due to timing of capital expenditures related to new restaurant construction.\nFor Fiscal 2016, compared to Fiscal 2015, net cash flows used in investing activities increased by $2.9 million primarily due to timing of capital expenditures related to new restaurant construction.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flows used by financing activities decreased $2.0 million from Fiscal 2016. In Fiscal 2017, the Company made $12.0 million repayments as compared to in Fiscal 2016 the Company made $15.0 million repayments under the 2015 Credit Facility.\nNet cash flows used by financing activities in Fiscal 2016 increased $19.8 million from Fiscal 2015. In Fiscal 2015, the Company generated $259.4 million from the IPO and borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility, offset by the payoff of the 2012 Credit Facility, pre-payment penalty, debt issuance costs and payment of IPO costs. In Fiscal 2016, the Company made $15.0 million repayments under the 2015 Credit Facility.\n2015 Credit Facility\nOn June 24, 2015, in connection with the closing of the IPO, we refinanced our 2012 Credit Facility and entered into the 2015 Credit Facility. Upon the closing of the IPO, we drew $165.0 million on the 2015 Credit Facility and used those borrowings, along with the net proceeds from the IPO, to repay the outstanding debt under the 2012 Credit Facility.\nThe 2015 Credit Facility provides for a $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The loans under the Revolving Credit Facility mature on June 24, 2020.\nAt our option, loans under the Revolving Credit Facility may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans and bear interest at a Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate, respectively, plus the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate\u201d for any Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be between 50 and 150 basis points with respect to Base Rate Loans and between 150 and 250 basis points with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, depending on the Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio. The current Applicable Rate will be (i) in the case of any Base Rate Loan 1.0% and in the case of any Eurodollar Rate Loan, 2.0%.\nThe 2015 Credit Facility contains a number of affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make certain acquisitions, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, and authorize or pay dividends. In addition, we will be required to maintain two financial covenants, which include a maximum Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio (at levels that vary until maturity) and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio. At December 31, 2017, these required ratios were 5.25 to 1 and 2.00 to 1, respectively and the Company was in compliance with those covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had seven letters of credit outstanding for a total of $5.7 million and $106.3 million of available borrowing capacity under the 2015 Credit Facility.\nContractual Obligations\nLeases\nWe lease certain restaurant locations, storage spaces, buildings and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Our restaurant leases generally have initial terms of between 10 and 20 years, and generally can be extended only in five-year increments. Our leases expire at various dates between 2018 and 2033, excluding extensions at our option. Some of our restaurant leases include renewal options, rent abatements and leasehold rental incentives, none of which are reflected in the following table. Some of our leases also include contingent rental payments based on sales volume, the impact of which also are not reflected in the following table.\nDuring Fiscal 2017, we entered into additional leases and exercised an extension on an existing lease, adding estimated minimum future rental payments of approximately $6.7 million attributable to these non-cancelable operating leases.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual arrangements at December 31, 2017 on actual basis and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 1 -\n3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 3 -\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Workers compensation reserve(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligations(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 138,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 138,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Scheduled interest payments(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease (minimum rent)(d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 192,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 347,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 211,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 71,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Estimated future payments attributable to our workers compensation reserve. Actual timing of payments may differ from the estimates above. \n (b) Our Revolving Credit Facility does not require principal payments on any outstanding balance until June 24, 2020. \n (c) The table above assumes an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a spread of 1.75% on our Revolving Credit Facility plus annual administrative agent fees and fees incurred on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. \n (d) Future minimum lease payments attributable to all locations in Brazil contain annual escalations that are tied to the IGPM inflation index. These payments, which will be made in the functional currency of the country, have been estimated using the period-end currency exchange rate and exclude subsequent changes in the prevailing IGPM index rate. Future minimum lease payments attributable to one location in Mexico contain annual escalations that are tied to the US CPI-U index. These payments, which will be made in the functional currency of the country, have been estimated using the period-end currency exchange rate and the US CPI-U index rate existing at the time of the lease was executed. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including insurance programs and lease obligations. As of December 31, 2017, letters of credit and letters of guaranty totaling $5.7 million have been issued. Other than these standby letters of credit, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts or synthetic leases.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, such as the valuation of long-lived, definite and indefinite-lived assets, estimated useful lives of assets, the reasonably assured lease terms of operating leases, valuation of the workers' compensation and Company-sponsored employee health insurance program liabilities, and deferred tax valuation allowances, that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and that the judgments and estimates are reasonable:\nInsurance Reserves\nBeginning in Fiscal 2013, the Company self-insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation claims and Company-sponsored employee health insurance programs. We estimate the accrued liabilities for all self-insurance programs at the end of each reporting period. Our estimate is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends and actuarial assumptions.\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015, we engaged a third party actuary to assist us in estimating our liability for our workers' compensation claims. We elected to accrue the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims discounted based on the cash flow estimates provided by the actuary. Prior to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015 we did not discount the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims. The discount on the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims as of December 31, 2017 is approximately $0.2 million. We believe that applying a discount to the estimated future cash flows provided by the actuarial analysis results in a more accurate estimate of the liability. The estimated liability for all other self-insurance programs is not discounted. The estimated liability for workers' compensation claims was $1.9 million as of December 31, 2017. The estimated liability for all other self-insurance programs was $0.4 million as of December 31, 2017.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOn a quarterly basis, or as circumstances warrant, we review long-lived assets to determine if triggering events have occurred which would require a test to determine if the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. Assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be separately identified, which is at the individual restaurant level. In the absence of extraordinary events, restaurants are included in our impairment analysis after they have been opened for 36 months. An initial three-year operating plan is developed for each new location and we remain committed to that plan barring unforeseen circumstances.\nDuring December 2017, the Company recognized a $4.2 million non-cash impairment charge related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in the US. The Company continues to evaluate the restaurant's operating performance and its options. A closure of this restaurant could result in a material charge in the period in which the Company ceases operations.\nOur restaurant in San Juan, Puerto Rico re-opened to the public in November 2017. Due to the extended closure, the San Juan location experienced operating losses during the third quarter and into the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017. While we believe these losses are temporary, should indicators suggest a prolonged period of closure and continued losses, this reduction in cash flows could challenge the recovery of carrying value of the restaurants' assets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulting from the acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized. We test our goodwill annually for impairment during the fourth quarter, or more frequently should an event occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Such events or circumstances may be a significant change in business climate, economic and industry trends, legal factors, negative operating performance indicators, significant competition, changes in strategy or disposition of a reporting unit or a portion thereof. We have identified two reporting units, the US and Brazil, based on the geography of the Company's operations to which goodwill is attributable. The impairment evaluation is conducted annually using a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded. In the second step, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for any excess or carrying value over fair value. No impairment to goodwill was recorded during any of the periods presented.\nIntangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. We test our indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment, through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount. The estimated fair value is determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets relate to the assigned value of the Fogo de Ch\u00e3o trade name. Definite-lived intangible assets consist of non-compete agreements. The non-compete agreements are amortized over five years, which is the term of the agreements, and are measured for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in the same manner as long-lived assets. No impairments related to these intangible assets were recorded in any of the periods presented. The term of the non-compete agreements were completed during 2017.\nOperating Leases and Deferred Rent\nWe operate the majority of our restaurants in leased premises. We record the minimum base rents including option periods which in the judgement of management are reasonably assured of renewal. In determining whether an option period is reasonably assured for renewal we consider the capital outlay required for a location and our target return on that investment. For purposes of calculating straight-line rents, the lease term commences on the date we obtain control of the property, which is normally when the property is ready for normal tenant improvements (build-out period). The difference between rent expense and rent paid is recorded as a deferred rent liability. Allowances for tenant improvements are included in the deferred rent liability and recognized over the life of the lease by reducing rent expense.\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act significantly revised the US tax code by, in part but not limited to: a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of US international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. Under Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes, the Company must recognize the effects of tax law changes in the period in which the new legislation is enacted.\nWe calculated an estimate of the impact of the Tax Act in its year-end income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of the Tax Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing. The provisional tax benefit recorded related to the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, was $15.0 million. The provisional tax expense related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was $6.5 million.\nThe Tax Act provides for a one-time transition tax under section 965 on previously untaxed post-1986 foreign income of specified foreign corporations owned by US shareholders by deeming those earnings to be repatriated. Foreign earnings considered held in the form of cash and cash equivalents are taxed at an effective rate of 15.5%, and the remaining earnings are taxed at an effective rate of 8%, which includes a partial participation exemption. We recorded $6.5 million expense related to its one-time repatriation inclusion. As addressed below, this amount is presented as provisional while we continue to review the balance of foreign earnings required to be included under section 965(a).\nWe have historically not utilized a foreign tax credit, instead opting to deduct all foreign taxes paid. In Fiscal 2017, we elected to calculate and utilize a foreign tax credit. We recorded a $2.1 million benefit related to foreign tax credits which includes a credit benefit of $3.3 million net of the $1.1 million Section 78 gross up expense. As addressed below, this amount is presented as provisional while we continue to review its foreign tax pool balance and attributes relevant to the section 904 foreign tax credit limitation.\nThe Tax Act provides for 100% bonus depreciation for eligible property placed in service after September 27, 2017, and before 2023. The Tax Act allows a Company to make an election for the 2017 tax year to apply 50% bonus depreciation rather than 100% bonus depreciation on eligible property. At this time, we plan to elect the 50% bonus depreciation. As addressed below, this amount is presented as provisional while we continue to review the impact of 100% bonus depreciation on its foreign tax credit utilization.\nOn December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") was issued to address the application of US GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. Pursuant to SAB 118, we are presenting the adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities, the liability related to the transition tax, and foreign tax credits as provisional amounts based on information available as of December 31, 2017. As further regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities and as accounting treatment is clarified, additional work may be necessary to ensure earnings as required by the calculations are properly determined. As we perform additional analysis on the application of the law, and as we refine our estimates in calculating the effect, our final analysis may be different from current provisional amounts. Any changes to the provisional amounts will be recognized in the period completed which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. Additionally, as a result of the Tax Act, we have not completed our evaluation of its indefinite reinvestment assertion with regard to foreign earnings under ASC 740-30. As a result, deferred tax liabilities may be increased or decreased during the period allowed under SAB 118.\nThe effects of other provisions of the Tax Act are not expected to have a material impact on our Fiscal 2017 consolidated financial statements. Other provisions of the Tax Act may impact us in Fiscal 2018. These include the new section 951A Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ( GILTI\u201d) anti-deferral rules and the section 245A deduction for certain dividends received from foreign corporations. We have not completed its analysis of the effect of these provisions, hence no estimate can currently be made and no provisional amounts were recorded in the financial statements for the impact of these provisions of the Tax Act. Based on the current interpretation, we may choose a method as an accounting policy to record deferred taxes in relation to the GILTI provisions or to record the tax in the period in which it occurs. Pursuant to SAB 118, we have not elected an accounting policy for the effect of the GILTI tax law provisions.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRecently issued accounting standards not included below are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, an amendment to ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services and expands related disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-10 clarifies ASU 2014-09 to address the potential for diversity in practice at the adoption. ASUs 2016-10 and 2014-09 are effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early application is permitted.\nThe majority of our revenues are from food and beverage sales at our restaurants. ASU 2014-09 will not have an impact on revenue recognition related to food and beverage sales. ASU 2014-09 requires gift card breakage to be recognized as revenue in proportion to the pattern of gift card redemptions exercised by our customers. Currently, the Company records breakage income within other revenue.\nThe new guidance may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings as of the date of adoption (modified retrospective approach). We have elected the modified retrospective adoption method and plan to adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company has evaluated the impact of adoption on the recognition of license fee and other income related to the Company's joint ventures and does not believe the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This guidance requires the recognition of most leases on the balance sheet to give investors, lenders, and other financial statement users a more comprehensive view of a company's long-term financial obligations as well as the assets it owns versus leases. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Currently, all of our restaurant and our restaurant support center leases are accounted for as operating leases, and therefore are not recorded within our balance sheet. We expect this adoption will result in a material increase in the assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, but will likely have an insignificant impact on our consolidated statements of earnings. In preparation for the adoption of the guidance, we are implementing controls and key system changes to enable the preparation of financial information.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which provides financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To achieve this, the amendments in this ASU replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The measurement of expected credit losses will be based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The amendments in this ASU will be applied using a modified-retrospective approach and, for public entities, are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company has not yet evaluated the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,\u201d which clarifies and provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues that are not currently addressed by current GAAP. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-15 effective Fiscal 2018. Upon adoption there will be no impact on the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350).\u201d ASU 2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test. The amendment requires an entity to perform its annual, or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. A goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nJOBS Act\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if we comply with the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth from time to time, we may avail ourselves of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we are choosing to opt out of any extended transition period, and as a result we will seek to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company\u201d for up to five years following the completion of our initial public offering which will be June 2020, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d section of this annual report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions described in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this annual report and included elsewhere in this annual report. Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section and included elsewhere in this annual report.\nIn this section and other parts of this Form 10-K, we refer to certain measures used for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We also may refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), but have corresponding GAAP-based measures. Where non-GAAP measures appear, we provide tables reconciling these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP-based measures and make reference to a discussion of their use. We believe these measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making.\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday that is closest to December 31 of that year. Each fiscal year generally comprises four 13-week fiscal quarters, although in the years with 53 weeks the fourth quarter represents a 14-week period. References to Fiscal 2017 relate to our 52-week fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. References to Fiscal 2016 relate to our 52-week fiscal year ended January 1, 2017. References to Fiscal 2015 relate to our 53-week fiscal year ended January 3, 2016.\nOverview\nFogo de Ch\u00e3o (fogo-dee-shoun) is a leading Brazilian steakhouse, or churrascaria, which has specialized for nearly 40 years in fire-roasting high-quality meats utilizing the centuries-old Southern Brazilian cooking technique of churrasco. We deliver a distinctive and authentic Brazilian dining experience through the combination of our high-quality Brazilian cuisine and our differentiated service model known as espeto corrido (Portuguese for continuous service\u201d) delivered by our churrasqueiros, which we refer to as our gaucho chefs. We offer our guests a variety of menu choices including our most popular offering the Full Churrasco Experience as well Gaucho Lunch, Weekend Brazilian Brunch and Bar Fogo menu items. The Full Churrasco Experience, our prix fixe menu, provides the opportunity to experience a variety of meats including beef, lamb, pork and chicken, simply seasoned and carefully fire-roasted to expose their natural flavors as well as a selection of fresh seasonal salads and specialty items at the Market Table.\nGrowth Strategies and Outlook\nOur growth is based on the following strategies:\n \u2022 Grow our restaurant base; \n \u2022 Grow our comparable restaurant sales; and \n \u2022 Improve margins by leveraging our infrastructure and investments in human capital. \nWe believe we are in the early stages of our growth with 50 current restaurants, 38 in the US, nine in Brazil and three international joint venture restaurants. Based on internal analysis and a study prepared by an independent third party, we believe there is a long-term growth potential for more than 100 domestic sites, with additional new restaurants internationally. We have a long track record of successful new restaurant development, having grown our restaurant count by a multiple of 10 since 2000, and at a 12.4% CAGR since 2010. While new restaurants are expected to be a key driver of our growth, we believe positive comparable restaurant sales growth and margin expansion through leveraging our infrastructure will also contribute to future growth.\nHighlights and Trends\nRestaurant Development\nRestaurant openings reflect the number of new restaurants opened during a particular reporting period. During Fiscal 2017 we opened our third international joint venture restaurant in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Over the next five years, we plan to increase our company-owned restaurant count by at least 10% annually, with North America being our primary market for new restaurant development. In addition, over the next five years, we plan to opportunistically open new restaurants in Brazil as attractive real estate locations become available. We will pursue growth in international markets through a combination of company-owned restaurants and joint ventures, which we believe allows us to expand our brand with limited capital investment by us. The actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control including, but not limited to, weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.\n\n (a) We opened our first Middle East JV restaurant in August 2017. We do not consolidate the results of our Middle East JV operations. \n (b) The lease for an underperforming restaurant in Brazil expired in September 2017 and not renewed. The restaurant was fully impaired as of January 1, 2017. \nKey Events\nMerger Agreement with Rh\u00f4ne\nOn February 20, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) among Prime Cut Intermediate Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Parent\u201d) and an investment entity affiliated with Rh\u00f4ne Capital V L.P. ( Rh\u00f4ne\u201d) and Prime Cut Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( Merger Subsidiary\u201d), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into the Company, which will survive as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent will finance the Merger with a combination of debt and equity financing.\nAt the effective time of the Merger,\n \u2022 each share of the Company's common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive $15.75 in cash, without interest; \n \u2022 each Company outstanding stock option will be cancelled, with the holder of such stock option becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (a) $15.75 minus (b) the exercise price per share of common stock subject to such stock option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of common stock subject to such stock option; and \n \u2022 the restrictions on each Company outstanding restricted stock will lapse, with the holder of such performance-based restricted stock becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) $15.75 multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of common stock subject to such restricted stock. \nFollowing execution of the Merger Agreement, certain affiliates and co-investors of Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. and certain directors and executive officers of the Company, who collectively hold approximately 61.56% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock of the Company, executed and delivered to the Company a written consent adopting the Merger Agreement. The Merger cannot be consummated until the passing of 20 calendar days from the date on which the Company mails to the Company's stockholders an information statement describing the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on Schedule 14C under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Following delivery of the written consent, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company may not engage in any further discussions or solicitations regarding the potential acquisition of the Company by any third party, and the Company has no ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into an alternative transaction.\nThe completion of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including, without limitation, (1) the absence of any restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other court order or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the Merger, (2) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (3) subject to certain qualifications, the accuracy of representations and warranties of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary, and (4) the performance in all material respects of the obligations of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary, respectively. The Merger is not subject to a financing condition. Completion of the Merger is expected early in the second fiscal quarter of 2018.\nNatural Disasters\nDuring the third quarter of Fiscal 2017, our operations were impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria which struck the US mainland and Puerto Rico adversely affecting 10 of our US restaurants. Most of the affected restaurants were minimally impacted, however four restaurants were significantly impacted requiring them to close for multiple days. These closures extended prior to landfall through the post-hurricane clean up periods. The US mainland restaurants returned to operations within a week of the hurricanes, with sales exceeding expectations for the remainder of Fiscal 2017. Our restaurant in San Juan, Puerto Rico re-opened mid-November 2017 with sales also exceeding our expectations for the remainder of Fiscal 2017. We maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our restaurants including property, flood and business interruption. Initial assessments have found minimal structural and cosmetic damage to the restaurants; however we are working with our insurance providers to assess the overall impact from the hurricanes and expect that process to take some time. As a result of the hurricane activity, we estimate total revenue was negatively impacted by $1.6 million for Fiscal 2017. We expect to recover a portion of the lost income through insurance recoveries in Fiscal 2018. The Company has not recorded any gains related to insurance recoveries during Fiscal 2017.\nIn addition, operations of our Mexican JV were impacted by multiple major earthquakes that affected the greater Mexico City metropolitan area. Our two restaurants in Mexico City sustained minimal cosmetic damage and we believe no structural damage. To date, we have not experienced a loss of operating days as a result of the earthquakes.\nSecondary Offering\nOn May 17, 2017, we completed a secondary offering of 5,175,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $14.00 per share, which included 675,000 shares sold to the underwriters pursuant to their over-allotment option. As all of these shares were offered by certain selling stockholders we did not receive any proceeds from the offering.\n2016 Summer Olympics\nRio de Janeiro hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics which were held during the third quarter of Fiscal 2016. As a result, we estimate our two Rio de Janeiro restaurants contributed approximately $1.4 million of incremental revenue in the third quarter of Fiscal 2016.\nRecent Events in Brazil\nBrazil's political environment has historically influenced, and continues to influence, the performance of the country's economy. Starting in 2015 a series of protests began in Brazil against the Brazilian government and its President. The initial protests occurred in cities throughout Brazil, including Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paolo, and continued throughout the remainder of 2015, culminating in the impeachment of the President of Brazil in 2016. After a somewhat successful start to the new President's administration, their proposed pension overhaul faced significant opposition with protests occurring in a number of cities in response to the government's austerity plans. The new administration also endured a number of scandals emerging from ongoing anti-corruption campaign which ultimately led to the current President's indictment on corruption charges in June 2017. In August 2017, Brazil's Lower House of government voted against sending the trial to Brazil's Supreme Court; however, a second round of corruption charges were leveled against the current President, whose term is due to end in October 2018, in September 2017. The protests and political unrest contributed to lower guest traffic in our restaurants in Brazil, in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2017. Additionally, growing security concerns are affecting guest traffic in our two Rio de Janeiro restaurants. While we believe these issues are temporary, should indicators suggest a permanent reduction in guest traffic and cash flows due to the prolonged unrest, the recovery of carrying value of certain Brazilian assets could be challenged.\nIn addition to the uncertain political environment, Brazil continues to suffer from a protracted economic recession that is negatively impacting our guests. Although we believe Fiscal 2017 represents an inflection point for the Brazilian economy, as supported by improving economic forecasts, political turbulence continues to cast a long shadow on the strength of the recovery. Nevertheless, we believe Brazil's economy will likely continue recovering as we lap the economic recession. With our focus on US development, Brazil will continue becoming a smaller portion of the overall business, representing less than 15% of our consolidated revenue base for the second half of Fiscal 2017.\nBrazilian legislation regulating the collection of tips in commercial establishments was approved by the President of Brazil and became effective on May 13, 2017. We have implemented new procedures intended to facilitate our compliance with the new tip legislation, however, we cannot predict whether our procedures will fully comply with any regulations that may be adopted in furtherance of the legislation or judicial determinations as to the requirements of the legislation. Additionally, comprehensive labor reform legislation became effective in November 2017. We anticipate that the new laws will be tested in Brazilian courts. We are attempting to implement the changes required under the new laws, but cannot predict the potential impact of the new laws, or judicial interpretation of such laws, on our business or prospective results of operations.\nTax Law Changes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law by President Trump. The Tax Act significantly revised the US corporate income tax regime by, among other things, lowering the US corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also repealing the deduction for domestic production activities, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. US GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $15.0 million due to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and a tax charge of $6.5 million due to the transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, in the three months ended December 31, 2017. Both of the tax benefit and the tax charge represent provisional amounts and the Company's current best estimates. Any adjustments recorded to the provisional amounts through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 will be included in income from operations as an adjustment to tax expense. The provisional amounts incorporate assumptions made based upon the Company's current interpretation of the Tax Act and may change as the Company receives additional clarification and implementation guidance.\nCommodity Pricing\nWe experienced lower and stable beef prices in Fiscal 2017, which allowed us to offset inflation on food costs and other meats as compared to Fiscal 2016. Prices at food-at-home outlets have posted lower year-over-year price increases, and supermarket prices decreased for the second year in a row, falling approximately 0.2 percent. Inflation has been lower than average due, in part, to a stronger US dollar.\nExchange Rate Impact\nWe experienced significant foreign currency improvement from Fiscal 2016 to Fiscal 2017 due to fluctuations of the Brazilian Real relative to the US dollar. When the Brazilian Real strengthens compared to the US dollar, it has a positive impact on our Brazilian operating results upon translation of those results into US dollars for the purposes of consolidation. We anticipate foreign currency to stabilize throughout Fiscal 2018 with respect to the Brazilian Real. See Supplemental Selected Constant Currency Information\u201d on page 60 for the exchange rate impact on current financial periods.\nPerformance Indicators\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures we use for determining how our business is performing are the number of new restaurant openings, comparable restaurant sales, restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP measures. See page 56 for discussion of non-GAAP financial measures.\nNew Restaurant Openings\nOur ability to successfully open new restaurants and expand our restaurant base is critical to adding revenue capacity to meet our goals for growth. New restaurant openings contribute additional operating weeks and revenue to our business. Before a new restaurant opens, we incur pre-opening costs, as described below. New restaurants often open with an initial start-up period of sales volatility. Operating margins tend to stabilize within twelve months of opening. New restaurants typically experience normal inefficiencies in the form of higher food, labor and other direct operating expenses and, as a result, restaurant contribution margins are generally lower during the start-up period of operation. To achieve our goal to successfully open new restaurants, we consider a number of factors including macro and micro economic conditions, availability of appropriate locations, competition in local markets, and the availability of teams to manage new locations. The actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of our control including, but not limited to, weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.\nComparable Restaurant Sales\nWe consider a restaurant to be comparable during the first full fiscal quarter following the eighteenth full month of operations. We adjust the sales included in the comparable restaurant calculation for restaurant closures, primarily as a result of remodels, so that the periods will be comparable. Changes in comparable restaurant sales reflect changes in sales for the comparable group of restaurants over a specified period of time. Changes in comparable sales reflect changes in guest count trends as well as changes in average check per person, as described below. This measure highlights performance of existing restaurants, as the impact of new restaurant openings is excluded. The Company uses a 52/53 week fiscal year convention. For fiscal years following a 53 week year the Company calculates comparable restaurant sales using the most comparable calendar week to the current reporting period.\nAverage Check Per Person\nAverage check per person is calculated by dividing total comparable restaurant sales by comparable restaurant guest counts for a given time period. Average check per person is influenced by menu prices and menu mix. Management uses this indicator to analyze trends in guests' preferences, the effectiveness of menu offerings and per guest expenditures.\nAverage Unit Volumes\nWe measure average unit volumes ( AUVs\u201d) on an annual (52-week) basis. In fiscal years with 53 weeks, we exclude the 53rd week from the AUV calculation for consistency purposes. AUVs consist of the average sales of all restaurants that have been open for a trailing 52-week period or longer. We adjust the sales included in AUV calculations for restaurant closures. This measurement allows us to assess changes in consumer spending patterns at our restaurants and the overall performance of our restaurant base.\nGuest Counts\nGuest counts are measured by the number of entr\u00e9es ordered at our restaurants over a given time period. Examples of our entr\u00e9es include our Full Churrasco Experience, \u00e0 la carte seafood items, and Gaucho Lunch.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of our Operating Results\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act significantly revised the US tax code by, in part but not limited to: a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of US international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. Under Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes, the Company must recognize the effects of tax law changes in the period in which the new legislation is enacted.\n52 vs. 53 Week Fiscal Year\nFiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 contained 52 weeks whereas Fiscal 2015 contained 53 weeks. We estimate the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 contributed approximately $6.8 million of incremental revenue, as compared to Fiscal 2016. While certain expenses that were directly related to the incremental revenue increased, other expenses, such as fixed costs, were incurred on a calendar basis.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn June 24, 2015, we completed our initial public offering (\"IPO\") of 5,073,528 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $20.00 per share, which included 661,764 shares of common stock sold to the underwriters pursuant to their option to purchase additional shares. After underwriters' discounts and commissions and offering costs, we received net proceeds from the IPO of $91.3 million. Proceeds from the IPO, together with borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility, were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our 2012 Credit Facility.\nCertain share-based awards granted from 2012 through 2015 include vesting conditions that require both (i) completion of a four or five-year vesting period and (ii) satisfaction of a Liquidity Event, as defined in the applicable award agreement. Under the terms of those agreements, a Liquidity Event is defined as the earlier to occur of (i) a change in control transaction or (ii) an initial public offering. Upon the closing of the IPO, options for the purchase of 783,606 shares of common stock vested as a result of the satisfaction of the Liquidity Event vesting condition. The Company recognized $5.7 million of compensation expense associated with these options during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\nTermination of the Advisory Services Agreement\nAs a result of the IPO, we terminated our Advisory Services Agreement with an affiliate of Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. and paid a one-time non-recurring payment of $7.5 million in connection with the termination during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. While we have benefitted from savings on management fees that we incurred as a private company, these benefits have been offset by the incremental costs we incurred as a public company such as legal, accounting, insurance and other compliance costs.\n2015 Credit Facility\nConcurrently with the consummation of our IPO, we refinanced our 2012 Credit Facility and entered into a new $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the 2015 Credit Facility\u201d). Loans under the 2015 Credit Facility bear interest at a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.50% or at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.50% and will mature in 2020. The 2015 Credit Facility contains customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries, including financial maintenance covenants requiring us to maintain a maximum Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (each as defined in the underlying credit facility agreement). Starting in Fiscal 2017 and through Fiscal 2018, the Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio may not be greater than 5.25 to 1 and the ratio will further reduce to 5.0 to 1 in Fiscal 2019, through maturity. The Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio may not be less than 2.00 to 1. Borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility may vary significantly from time to time depending on our cash needs at any given time. Upon the consummation of our IPO we drew $165.0 million under the 2015 Credit Facility and used those borrowings, along with the net proceeds from our IPO, to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the 2012 Credit Facility. We recorded a loss of $6.0 million on the extinguishment of the 2012 Credit Facility during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\nStock Split\nIn connection with the closing of the IPO, we effected a stock split pursuant to which each share held by the holder of common stock was reclassified into 25.4588 shares. All share and per share data have been retroactively restated to give effect to the stock split.\nSignificant Components of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nRevenue primarily consists of food and beverage sales, net of any employee meals and complimentary meals. Revenue is recognized when food and beverage products are sold at our restaurants net of any discounts. Revenue in a given period is directly influenced by the number of operating weeks in such period, the number of restaurants we operate and comparable restaurant sales growth. Proceeds from the sale of gift cards that do not have expiration dates are recorded as deferred revenue at the time of the sale and recognized as revenue when the gift card is redeemed by the holder. The portion of gift cards sold which are never redeemed is commonly referred to as gift card breakage. We recognize gift card breakage revenue for gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and we determine there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to governmental agencies.\nFood and Beverage Costs\nFood and beverage costs include the direct costs associated with food, beverage and distribution of our menu items. We measure food and beverage costs by tracking the cost as a percentage of revenue. Food and beverage costs as a percentage of revenue are generally influenced by the cost of food and beverage items, distribution costs and sales mix. These components are variable in nature, increase with revenue, are subject to increases or decreases based on fluctuations in commodity costs, including beef, lamb, pork, chicken and seafood prices, and depend in part on the controls we have in place to manage costs at our restaurants.\nCompensation and Benefit Costs\nCompensation and benefits costs comprise restaurant and regional management salaries and bonuses, hourly staff payroll and other payroll-related expenses, including bonus expenses, share-based compensation, vacation pay, payroll taxes, fringe benefits and health insurance expenses and are measured by tracking hourly and total labor as a percentage of revenue.\nOccupancy and Other Operating Expenses\nOccupancy and other operating expenses comprise all occupancy costs, consisting of both fixed and variable portions of rent, common area maintenance charges, utility costs, credit card fees, real estate property and other related taxes and other related restaurant supply and occupancy costs, but exclude depreciation and amortization expense, and are measured by tracking occupancy and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nMarketing and advertising costs include all media, production and related costs for both local restaurant advertising and national marketing. We measure the efficiency of our marketing and advertising expenditures by tracking these costs as a percentage of total revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nGeneral and administrative costs are comprised of costs related to certain corporate and administrative functions that support development and restaurant operations. These expenses are generally fixed and reflect management, supervisory and staff salaries, employee benefits and bonuses, share-based compensation, travel expense, information systems, training, corporate rent, technology, market research, and professional and consulting fees, including fees related to the implementation of, and compliance with, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We measure general and administrative costs by tracking general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue.\nPre-opening Costs\nPre-opening costs are costs incurred prior to, and directly associated with, opening a restaurant, and primarily consist of manager salaries, relocation costs, recruiting expenses, employee payroll and related training costs for new employees, including rehearsal of service activities, as well as straight-line lease costs incurred prior to opening. In addition, pre-opening costs include public relations costs incurred prior to opening. We typically start incurring pre-opening costs four to six months prior to opening and these costs tend to increase four weeks prior to opening as we begin training activities.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and certain definite life intangible assets. We depreciate capitalized leasehold improvements over the shorter of the total expected lease term or their estimated useful life.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we operate. Historically we have generated taxable income in the US and Brazil. Our provision includes federal, state and local, and foreign current and deferred income tax expense.\nSegment Reporting\nWe operate our restaurants using a single restaurant concept and brand. Each restaurant under our single global brand operates with similar types of products and menu, providing a continuous service style, similar contracts, customers and employees, irrespective of location. We have identified two operating segments: US and Brazil, which is how we organize our restaurants for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Our joint venture in Mexico is included in the US for segment reporting purposes as the operations of the joint venture are monitored by the US segment management. License fee revenue, store opening fee and country development fee revenue attributable to our joint venture in the Middle East JV is included in other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize key components of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue:\nFiscal 2017 (52 Weeks) Compared to Fiscal 2016 (52 Weeks)\n(dollars in thousands)\n\n (a) Calculated as a percentage of total revenue. \n (b) Calculated percentage increase / (decrease) in dollars. \n (c) Calculated increase / (decrease) in percentage of total revenue. \n * Not meaningful. \nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased due to a $25.3 million increase in non-comparable restaurant sales, a favorable foreign exchange impact of $3.3 million, and a $0.2 million increase in joint venture revenue, offset by a $2.8 million decrease in comparable restaurant sales. Total comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.3%.\nUS restaurant revenue increased due to a $25.3 million increase in non-comparable restaurant sales and a $1.0 million increase in comparable restaurant sales. US comparable restaurant sales increased 0.5%.\nBrazil restaurant revenue decreased due to a $3.8 million decrease in comparable restaurant sales offset by a favorable foreign exchange impact of $3.3 million. Brazil comparable restaurant sales decreased 7.2%. The Rio de Janeiro locations' results included lapping the 2016 Summer Olympics during the third quarter of Fiscal 2017. Excluding the impact of the 2016 Summer Olympics, Brazil comparable restaurant sales decreased 4.3%\nOther revenue increased as our first Middle East JV restaurant opened in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. In connection with the Jeddah opening we recognized a country development fee and a store opening fee in addition to a recurring license fee.\nFood and Beverage Costs\nFood and beverage costs increased due to a $7.7 million increase in food and beverage costs of non-comparable restaurants and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $1.1 million, offset by a $1.3 million decrease in food and beverage costs of comparable restaurants. As a percentage of total revenue, total food and beverage costs remained flat in spite of new restaurant openings and the impact of the hurricanes, somewhat offset by reduced liquor and desserts costs in Brazil.\nCompensation and Benefit Costs\nCompensation and benefit costs increased due to a $7.7 million increase in non-comparable restaurant labor expense, a $0.7 million increase in comparable restaurant labor expense and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $0.5 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total compensation and benefits costs increased as a result of wage rate inflation in the US and Brazil in addition to inefficiencies associated with new restaurant openings, marginally offset by lower insurance costs.\nOccupancy and Other Operating Expenses\nOccupancy and other operating expenses increased due to a $5.7 million increase in non-comparable restaurant operating expenses, a $0.9 million increase in comparable restaurant operating expenses, and an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of $0.7 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total occupancy and other operating costs increased due to higher costs of rent as a percentage of sales in our new restaurants as these stores are in the early stages of their revenue growth curve, the timing of restaurant repairs, and local commercial rent taxes.\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nMarketing and advertising costs increased due to a refreshed advertising campaign during Fiscal 2017 as well as an increase in brand awareness advertising. As a percentage of total revenue, marketing and advertising costs increased marginally.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nGeneral and administrative costs increased due to a $1.6 million increase in corporate compensation as a result of additional headcount in the US, $0.7 million in expenses related to our secondary offering in the second quarter of Fiscal 2017, $0.4 million in concurrent corporate office rents as we transition to our new corporate office space, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $0.2 million and a $0.1 million donation to the Houston Food Bank in relation to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. These increases were offset by a decrease of $0.3 million in stock compensation expense. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative costs increased 0.3%.\nPre-opening Costs\nPre-opening costs increased due to the timing of new restaurant development. During Fiscal 2017 we opened five US restaurants and had an additional three restaurants under construction at year-end that are due to open in Fiscal 2018. During Fiscal 2016 we opened three US restaurants and had an additional three restaurants under construction at year-end that opened during the first half of Fiscal 2017.\nNon-cash Impairment Charges\nDuring Fiscal 2017, we recognized $4.2 million in non-cash impairment charges related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in the US. The Company continues to evaluate the restaurant's operating performance and its options. A closure of this restaurant could result in a material charge in the period in which the Company ceases operations. During Fiscal 2016, we recognized $0.3 million in non-cash impairment charges related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in Brazil. The lease for this underperforming restaurant in Brazil expired in September 2017 and was not renewed.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased slightly due to a 0.6% increase in the interest rate on our 2015 Credit Facility, which was alleviated marginally by a decrease in the average outstanding balance.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased due to increased cash and cash equivalents in Brazil and favorable interest rates earned on those balances.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act significantly revised the US tax code by, in part but not limited to: a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of US international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. Under Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes, the Company must recognize the effects of tax law changes in the period in which the new legislation is enacted.\nThe Fiscal 2017 income tax benefit was primarily comprised of $9.4 million of income tax expense at the federal statutory rate, $6.5 million expense related to its one-time repatriation inclusion, $1.4 million of state income taxes, net of the federal benefit, and $0.8 million of subpart F income. These expenses were more than offset by $15.0 million of deferred tax liability revaluation, $2.1 million of foreign tax credits, $2.1 million of employment credits, and $0.3 million of other credits.\nThe Fiscal 2016 tax expense was comprised of $12.7 million of income tax expense at the federal statutory rate, $1.3 million of state income taxes, net of the federal benefit, $0.6 million of subpart F income, and $0.4 million of other non-deductible expenses. These expenses were offset by $1.2 million of foreign tax rate differential and $1.8 million of employment credits.\nFiscal 2016 (52 Weeks) Compared to Fiscal 2015 (53 Weeks)\n(dollars in thousands)\n\n (a) Calculated as a percentage of total revenue. \n (b) Calculated percentage increase / (decrease) in dollars. \n (c) Calculated increase / (decrease) in percentage of total revenue. \n * Not meaningful. \nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased due to a $27.6 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 and a $1.4 million increase in revenue attributable to the 2016 Summer Olympics, offset by the 53rd week impact of $6.8 million, a $4.2 million decrease in comparable restaurant revenue and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $1.4 million. Total comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.6%.\nUS restaurant revenue increased due to a $26.5 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, offset by the 53rd week impact of $6.0 million and a $2.3 million decrease in comparable restaurant revenue. US comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.6%.\nBrazil restaurant revenue decreased due to a $1.9 million decrease in comparable restaurant revenue, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $1.4 million and the 53rd week impact of $0.8 million, offset by a $1.4 million increase in revenue attributable to the 2016 Summer Olympics and a $1.1 million increase in revenue from new restaurants opened in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015. Brazil comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.5%.\nOther revenue includes gift card breakage revenue recognized by our US operating segment during Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 related to gift cards whose likelihood of redemption was determined to be remote.\nFood and Beverage Costs\nFood and beverage costs increased due to a $7.5 million increase in food and beverage costs from non-comparable restaurants. However, the increase was offset by a $3.1 million decrease in comparable restaurant food and beverage costs, a $1.8 million reduction due to the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.5 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total food and beverage costs decreased primarily due to reductions in protein commodity pricing, improvements in mix shift with the introduction of seasonal menu offerings and waste reduction efforts.\nCompensation and Benefit Costs\nCompensation and benefit costs increased due to a $9.3 million increase in non-comparable restaurant labor expenses and a $0.2 million increase in comparable restaurant labor expenses, offset by a $1.7 million decrease in cumulative share-based compensation expense primarily recognized in conjunction with the IPO in Fiscal 2015, a $1.4 million reduction due to the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.2 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total compensation and benefits costs increased due to inefficiencies associated with new restaurant openings as our management teams become more accustomed to predicting, managing and servicing the sales volumes of their new restaurants. The increase is also being driven by investments in third managers as well as increases in minimum wages and group health insurance claims.\nOccupancy and Other Operating Expenses\nOccupancy and other operating expenses increased primarily due to a $6.7 million increase in non-comparable restaurant expenses and a $2.0 million increase in comparable restaurant expenses, offset by a $0.6 million reduction due to the impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2015 and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $0.3 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total occupancy and other operating costs increased as a result of increased fixed occupancy costs on lower revenue.\nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nMarketing and advertising costs increased due to a larger revenue base and additional advertising expenses. As a percentage of total revenue, total marketing and advertising expenses were essentially flat.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nGeneral and administrative costs decreased due to the 2015 recognition of cumulative share-based compensation during the second quarter triggered by the IPO in the amount of $4.3 million, as well as a one-time charge of $7.5 million for the disposition of the Advisory Services Agreement with an affiliate of THL in connection with the IPO and a $1.2 million decrease in corporate compensation expense. These decreases were offset by a $0.3 million increase in insurance, a $0.3 million increase in corporate travel and a $0.2 million increase in tax consulting expenses. As a percentage of total revenue, total general and administrative costs decreased as a result of lapping IPO related expenses from Fiscal 2015.\nPre-opening Costs\nPre-opening costs decreased due to the timing of new restaurant development. During Fiscal 2016 we opened four restaurants and had an additional three restaurants under construction at year-end that opened in Fiscal 2017. During Fiscal 2015 we opened seven restaurants and had an additional restaurant under construction at year-end that opened during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 we paid-off our 2012 Credit Facility with the proceeds from the IPO plus proceeds from the 2015 Credit Facility. As a result, we wrote off unamortized loan costs and unamortized original issue discounts, and paid a pre-payment penalty of $0.3 million for a total loss on the extinguishment of $6.0 million.\nNon-cash Impairment Charges\nDuring Fiscal 2016, we recognized a $0.3 million non-cash impairment charge related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in Brazil.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased due to a reduction in the average outstanding principal balance owed and a reduction in interest rates following the extinguishment of the 2012 Credit Facility that occurred during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased due to increased cash and cash equivalents in Brazil and favorable interest rates earned on those balances.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe recognized income tax expense in Fiscal 2016 as compared to an income tax benefit in Fiscal 2015. The increase in income tax expense from Fiscal 2015 is primarily attributable to the change in assertion with respect to undistributed foreign earnings and the release of a valuation allowance during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015. We had historically provided deferred taxes under ASC 740-30-25, formerly APB 23, for the presumed repatriation to the US earnings from our Brazilian subsidiaries. In June 2015, we asserted that undistributed net earnings of our Brazilian subsidiaries would be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the US. This was primarily driven by a reduction in debt service costs on a forward basis as a result of the IPO. Additionally, future US cash projections and our intent to continue investing in restaurants in foreign jurisdictions with cash generated in those jurisdictions, drove our decision to make the assertion. We also made the decision to release our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset. The decision to release the valuation allowance was triggered in conjunction with the IPO. Reduced debt service costs and historic cumulative earnings (US pretax income plus permanent tax differences) were all sources of positive evidence that led us to believe that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets.\nOur consolidated effective tax rate varies from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to foreign earnings being subjected to taxation at lower tax rates, FICA tax credits, state income taxes, and nondeductible equity-based compensation.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin (collectively, the \"non-GAAP financial measures\"). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP measures used by the Company may be different from the methods used by other companies.\nRestaurant Contribution and Restaurant Contribution Margin\nRestaurant contribution, a non-GAAP financial measure, is equal to revenue generated by our restaurants sales less direct restaurant operating costs (which include food and beverage costs, compensation and benefits costs, and occupancy and certain other operating costs but exclude depreciation and amortization expense). This performance measure includes only the costs that restaurant level managers can directly control and excludes other operating costs that are essential to conduct the Company's business. Depreciation and amortization expense is excluded because it is not an operating cost that can be directly controlled by restaurant level managers. Restaurant contribution margin is equal to restaurant contribution as a percentage of revenue from restaurant sales. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are supplemental measures of operating performance of our restaurants and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to those reported by other companies.\nWe use restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin as key metrics to evaluate the profitability of incremental sales at our restaurants, to evaluate our restaurant performance across periods and to evaluate our restaurant financial performance compared with our competitors. We believe restaurant level operating margin is useful to investors in that it highlights trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent to investors when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. Because other\ncompanies may calculate restaurant level margin differently than we do, restaurant level margin as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nRestaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\nRestaurant Contribution\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of income from operations, which is a GAAP financial measure, to total segment restaurant contribution (dollars in thousands).\n\nThe following table summarizes restaurant contribution by segment and restaurant contribution margin by segment for Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016 (dollars in thousands).\n\n (a) Calculated as a percentage of total revenue or segment revenue where applicable. \n (b) Calculated percentage increase / (decrease) in dollars. \n (c) Calculated increase / (decrease) in percentage of total revenue or segment revenue where applicable. \n * Not meaningful. \nRestaurant Contribution\nThe following tables summarize restaurant contribution by segment and restaurant contribution margin by segment for Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015 (dollars in thousands).\n\n (a) Calculated as a percentage of total revenue or segment revenue where applicable. \n (b) Calculated percentage increase / (decrease) in dollars. \n (c) Calculated increase / (decrease) in percentage of total revenue or segment revenue where applicable. \n * Not meaningful. \nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization plus the sum of certain operating and non-operating expenses, including pre-opening costs, losses on modifications and extinguishment of debt, share-based compensation costs, management and consulting fees, non-cash impairment charges, one-time costs associated with the 2015 IPO, retention agreement costs, and other non-cash or similar adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. By monitoring and controlling our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, we can gauge the overall profitability of our company. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin because (i) we believe this measure is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) we believe investors will find this measure useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin internally as a benchmark to compare our performance to that of our competitors.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are (i) it does not reflect our cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, (ii) it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs, (iii) it does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt, (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements, (v) it does not adjust for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows, (vi) it does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations, and (vii) other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Fogo de Ch\u00e3o, Inc. (dollars in thousands).\n\n (a) For Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, excludes $0.4 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of depreciation expense attributable to our joint venture in Mexico. \n (b) For Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, excludes $0.04 million, $0.03 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of income tax expense attributable to our joint venture in Mexico. \n (c) For Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, excludes $0.0 million, $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of pre-opening costs incurred by our joint venture in Mexico. \n (d) For Fiscal 2015, includes $5.7 million of compensation expense recognized upon the closing of the IPO attributable to the vesting of stock options. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (e) Consists of non-cash portion of straight-line rent expense. \n (f) For Fiscal 2017, consists of non-cash impairment charge related to the reduction in carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in the United States. For Fiscal 2016, consists of non-cash impairment charge related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in Brazil. \n (g) For Fiscal 2017, amount includes $0.2 million of one time accrual for the Brazil Union matter, $0.1 million of costs incurred in the closing of the Salvador restaurant, $0.1 million of one time labor claims and $0.1 million of costs incurred in the Brazil Restructure. For Fiscal 2016, amount includes $0.1 million of one-time legal and accounting fees and $0.3 million of one-time expenses related to the realignment of management of the Brazilian subsidiaries and the legal transfer of the Brazilian subsidiaries to the Company's Dutch holding company to support the Company's expansion into international markets. \n (h) Consists primarily of payments to an affiliate of THL and advisors engaged by an affiliate of THL for advisory and consulting services. For Fiscal 2015, includes the $7.5 million fee paid to an affiliate of THL as a result of the termination of the advisory services agreement with that affiliate. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (i) Consists primarily of non-cash charges resulting from the extinguishment/modification of our prior credit facilities. For Fiscal 2015, includes $0.3 million pre-payment premium and $0.1 million in legal and other expenses we paid in connection with the termination of our 2012 Credit Facility. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (j) Consists of cash payments to our regional managers pursuant to retention and non-compete agreements executed in 2012. The final payments under these agreements were paid in October 2015. \n (k) Represents external professional service costs incurred as we assessed and initiated the process of becoming a public company. These costs include accounting and legal fees for public readiness services, documentation of internal controls to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and external auditor fees incurred for review of all fiscal quarters included in the registration statement. \nSupplemental Selected Constant Currency Information\nAs exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of certain results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors' ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. We calculate constant currency by retranslating results across all prior periods presented using a derived exchange rate for the most current year periods presented based on actual results. The tables set forth below calculate constant currency at a foreign currency exchange rate of 3.1936 Brazilian reals to 1 US dollar, which represents the derived exchange rates for Fiscal 2017, calculated as explained above. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital requirements are principally the build-out cost of new restaurants, renovations of existing restaurants and corporate infrastructure, as well payments of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness and lease obligations. We also require capital resources to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate support and information technology infrastructures. Our main sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operating activities, construction cost contributions from landlords when available to us (also known as tenant improvement allowances) and borrowings under our existing and previous credit facilities.\nThe Company had historically provided deferred taxes under ASC 740-30-25, formerly APB 23, for the presumed repatriation to the US earnings from the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries. In June 2015, the Company asserted that the outside basis difference, including undistributed earnings, of its Brazilian subsidiaries would be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the US. This was primarily driven by a reduction in debt service costs on a go-forward basis as a result of the IPO. The assertion was supported by future US cash projections and the Company's intent to continue using foreign-generated cash to invest in foreign restaurants. As a result of the change in assertion, the Company reduced its deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed foreign earnings by $13.9 million. In 2016, the Company effectuated an internal restructuring whereby it created a new Dutch holding company, FDC Netherlands Co\u00f6peratief U.A. ( Fogo Co-op\u201d) and contributed all of its Brazilian subsidiaries to Fogo Co-op. For US federal income tax purposes, this transaction was structured as a tax-free reorganization. Since the restructuring, Fogo Co-op is treated as the regarded or separate legal entity for US federal income tax purposes and the Brazilian entities are branches or divisions of Fogo Co-op. Consequently, income or losses earned by the Brazilian entities are deemed to be earned by Fogo Co-op for US federal income tax purposes.\nThe Company is not able to determine a reasonable estimate of the deferred tax liability, if any, that would be recorded if the Company were to change its indefinite reinvestment assertion. Missing or incomplete information relevant to this analysis includes tax basis and book basis in the shares of Fogo Co-op. In addition, the undistributed earnings of approximately $51.5 million related to Fogo Co-Op could be subject to state income tax or withholding tax. Pursuant to SAB 118, the Company will continue to apply ASC 740 based on the provisions of the tax law in effect immediately prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, including the historical indefinite reinvestment assertion with respect to the outside basis differences.\nDuring 2018, the Company will analyze the impact of the Tax Act on its indefinite reinvestment assertion. This analysis will consider the impact of previously taxed earnings created under section 965, the application of the new section 245A dividends received deduction, the impact of the new section 951A GILTI tax rules, state law changes, the existence of an outside basis difference in excess of earnings, currency translation adjustment impacts, and shifts in the global business environment resulting from the Tax Act.\nWe intend to spend approximately $27.0 million to $31.0 million in Fiscal 2018 on capital expenditures, net of tenant allowances, including approximately $23.0 million to $25.0 million for new restaurant development and approximately $4.0 million to $6.0 million on opportunistic restaurant remodeling.\nWe believe that our cash from operations and borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our restaurants or systems such as our planned opportunistic restaurant remodel program, which we could fund through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash from operations.\nThe following table presents the primary components of net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated.\n\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in Fiscal 2017 decreased $0.7 million from Fiscal 2016. The decrease is primarily attributable to a $3.5 million decrease in cash received related to the timing of accounts and other receivables, a $0.7 million increase in cash paid for secondary offering costs, a $0.6 million increase in cash paid interest, a $0.6 million increase in cash paid for inventory, $0.5 million related to duplicate rent costs for the corporate office, and a $0.4 million increase in pre-opening expenses. These decreases to cash were offset by $2.5 million increase in cash related to the timing of payments of liabilities, and a $2.7 million net increase in deferred rent and tenant allowance.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in Fiscal 2016 increased $18.7 million from Fiscal 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to an $8.6 million decrease in cash paid interest, an $8.2 million increase in cash related to the timing of collections of receivables and payments of liabilities, a $1.3 million decrease in pre-opening expenses, and a $0.7 million net increase in deferred revenue\nInvesting Activities\nFor Fiscal 2017, compared to Fiscal 2016, net cash flows used in investing activities decreased by $2.5 million primarily due to timing of capital expenditures related to new restaurant construction.\nFor Fiscal 2016, compared to Fiscal 2015, net cash flows used in investing activities increased by $2.9 million primarily due to timing of capital expenditures related to new restaurant construction.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flows used by financing activities decreased $2.0 million from Fiscal 2016. In Fiscal 2017, the Company made $12.0 million repayments as compared to in Fiscal 2016 the Company made $15.0 million repayments under the 2015 Credit Facility.\nNet cash flows used by financing activities in Fiscal 2016 increased $19.8 million from Fiscal 2015. In Fiscal 2015, the Company generated $259.4 million from the IPO and borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility, offset by the payoff of the 2012 Credit Facility, pre-payment penalty, debt issuance costs and payment of IPO costs. In Fiscal 2016, the Company made $15.0 million repayments under the 2015 Credit Facility.\n2015 Credit Facility\nOn June 24, 2015, in connection with the closing of the IPO, we refinanced our 2012 Credit Facility and entered into the 2015 Credit Facility. Upon the closing of the IPO, we drew $165.0 million on the 2015 Credit Facility and used those borrowings, along with the net proceeds from the IPO, to repay the outstanding debt under the 2012 Credit Facility.\nThe 2015 Credit Facility provides for a $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The loans under the Revolving Credit Facility mature on June 24, 2020.\nAt our option, loans under the Revolving Credit Facility may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans and bear interest at a Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate, respectively, plus the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate\u201d for any Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be between 50 and 150 basis points with respect to Base Rate Loans and between 150 and 250 basis points with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, depending on the Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio. The current Applicable Rate will be (i) in the case of any Base Rate Loan 1.0% and in the case of any Eurodollar Rate Loan, 2.0%.\nThe 2015 Credit Facility contains a number of affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make certain acquisitions, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, and authorize or pay dividends. In addition, we will be required to maintain two financial covenants, which include a maximum Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio (at levels that vary until maturity) and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio. At December 31, 2017, these required ratios were 5.25 to 1 and 2.00 to 1, respectively and the Company was in compliance with those covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had seven letters of credit outstanding for a total of $5.7 million and $106.3 million of available borrowing capacity under the 2015 Credit Facility.\nContractual Obligations\nLeases\nWe lease certain restaurant locations, storage spaces, buildings and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Our restaurant leases generally have initial terms of between 10 and 20 years, and generally can be extended only in five-year increments. Our leases expire at various dates between 2018 and 2033, excluding extensions at our option. Some of our restaurant leases include renewal options, rent abatements and leasehold rental incentives, none of which are reflected in the following table. Some of our leases also include contingent rental payments based on sales volume, the impact of which also are not reflected in the following table.\nDuring Fiscal 2017, we entered into additional leases and exercised an extension on an existing lease, adding estimated minimum future rental payments of approximately $6.7 million attributable to these non-cancelable operating leases.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual arrangements at December 31, 2017 on actual basis and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\n\n (a) Estimated future payments attributable to our workers compensation reserve. Actual timing of payments may differ from the estimates above. \n (b) Our Revolving Credit Facility does not require principal payments on any outstanding balance until June 24, 2020. \n (c) The table above assumes an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a spread of 1.75% on our Revolving Credit Facility plus annual administrative agent fees and fees incurred on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. \n (d) Future minimum lease payments attributable to all locations in Brazil contain annual escalations that are tied to the IGPM inflation index. These payments, which will be made in the functional currency of the country, have been estimated using the period-end currency exchange rate and exclude subsequent changes in the prevailing IGPM index rate. Future minimum lease payments attributable to one location in Mexico contain annual escalations that are tied to the US CPI-U index. These payments, which will be made in the functional currency of the country, have been estimated using the period-end currency exchange rate and the US CPI-U index rate existing at the time of the lease was executed. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including insurance programs and lease obligations. As of December 31, 2017, letters of credit and letters of guaranty totaling $5.7 million have been issued. Other than these standby letters of credit, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts or synthetic leases.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, such as the valuation of long-lived, definite and indefinite-lived assets, estimated useful lives of assets, the reasonably assured lease terms of operating leases, valuation of the workers' compensation and Company-sponsored employee health insurance program liabilities, and deferred tax valuation allowances, that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and that the judgments and estimates are reasonable:\nInsurance Reserves\nBeginning in Fiscal 2013, the Company self-insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation claims and Company-sponsored employee health insurance programs. We estimate the accrued liabilities for all self-insurance programs at the end of each reporting period. Our estimate is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends and actuarial assumptions.\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015, we engaged a third party actuary to assist us in estimating our liability for our workers' compensation claims. We elected to accrue the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims discounted based on the cash flow estimates provided by the actuary. Prior to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015 we did not discount the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims. The discount on the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims as of December 31, 2017 is approximately $0.2 million. We believe that applying a discount to the estimated future cash flows provided by the actuarial analysis results in a more accurate estimate of the liability. The estimated liability for all other self-insurance programs is not discounted. The estimated liability for workers' compensation claims was $1.9 million as of December 31, 2017. The estimated liability for all other self-insurance programs was $0.4 million as of December 31, 2017.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOn a quarterly basis, or as circumstances warrant, we review long-lived assets to determine if triggering events have occurred which would require a test to determine if the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. Assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be separately identified, which is at the individual restaurant level. In the absence of extraordinary events, restaurants are included in our impairment analysis after they have been opened for 36 months. An initial three-year operating plan is developed for each new location and we remain committed to that plan barring unforeseen circumstances.\nDuring December 2017, the Company recognized a $4.2 million non-cash impairment charge related to the reduction in the carrying value of an underperforming restaurant in the US. The Company continues to evaluate the restaurant's operating performance and its options. A closure of this restaurant could result in a material charge in the period in which the Company ceases operations.\nOur restaurant in San Juan, Puerto Rico re-opened to the public in November 2017. Due to the extended closure, the San Juan location experienced operating losses during the third quarter and into the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017. While we believe these losses are temporary, should indicators suggest a prolonged period of closure and continued losses, this reduction in cash flows could challenge the recovery of carrying value of the restaurants' assets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulting from the acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized. We test our goodwill annually for impairment during the fourth quarter, or more frequently should an event occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Such events or circumstances may be a significant change in business climate, economic and industry trends, legal factors, negative operating performance indicators, significant competition, changes in strategy or disposition of a reporting unit or a portion thereof. We have identified two reporting units, the US and Brazil, based on the geography of the Company's operations to which goodwill is attributable. The impairment evaluation is conducted annually using a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded. In the second step, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for any excess or carrying value over fair value. No impairment to goodwill was recorded during any of the periods presented.\nIntangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. We test our indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment, through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount. The estimated fair value is determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets relate to the assigned value of the Fogo de Ch\u00e3o trade name. Definite-lived intangible assets consist of non-compete agreements. The non-compete agreements are amortized over five years, which is the term of the agreements, and are measured for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in the same manner as long-lived assets. No impairments related to these intangible assets were recorded in any of the periods presented. The term of the non-compete agreements were completed during 2017.\nOperating Leases and Deferred Rent\nWe operate the majority of our restaurants in leased premises. We record the minimum base rents including option periods which in the judgement of management are reasonably assured of renewal. In determining whether an option period is reasonably assured for renewal we consider the capital outlay required for a location and our target return on that investment. For purposes of calculating straight-line rents, the lease term commences on the date we obtain control of the property, which is normally when the property is ready for normal tenant improvements (build-out period). The difference between rent expense and rent paid is recorded as a deferred rent liability. Allowances for tenant improvements are included in the deferred rent liability and recognized over the life of the lease by reducing rent expense.\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act significantly revised the US tax code by, in part but not limited to: a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of US international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. Under Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes, the Company must recognize the effects of tax law changes in the period in which the new legislation is enacted.\nWe calculated an estimate of the impact of the Tax Act in its year-end income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of the Tax Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing. The provisional tax benefit recorded related to the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, was $15.0 million. The provisional tax expense related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was $6.5 million.\nThe Tax Act provides for a one-time transition tax under section 965 on previously untaxed post-1986 foreign income of specified foreign corporations owned by US shareholders by deeming those earnings to be repatriated. Foreign earnings considered held in the form of cash and cash equivalents are taxed at an effective rate of 15.5%, and the remaining earnings are taxed at an effective rate of 8%, which includes a partial participation exemption. We recorded $6.5 million expense related to its one-time repatriation inclusion. As addressed below, this amount is presented as provisional while we continue to review the balance of foreign earnings required to be included under section 965(a).\nWe have historically not utilized a foreign tax credit, instead opting to deduct all foreign taxes paid. In Fiscal 2017, we elected to calculate and utilize a foreign tax credit. We recorded a $2.1 million benefit related to foreign tax credits which includes a credit benefit of $3.3 million net of the $1.1 million Section 78 gross up expense. As addressed below, this amount is presented as provisional while we continue to review its foreign tax pool balance and attributes relevant to the section 904 foreign tax credit limitation.\nThe Tax Act provides for 100% bonus depreciation for eligible property placed in service after September 27, 2017, and before 2023. The Tax Act allows a Company to make an election for the 2017 tax year to apply 50% bonus depreciation rather than 100% bonus depreciation on eligible property. At this time, we plan to elect the 50% bonus depreciation. As addressed below, this amount is presented as provisional while we continue to review the impact of 100% bonus depreciation on its foreign tax credit utilization.\nOn December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") was issued to address the application of US GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. Pursuant to SAB 118, we are presenting the adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities, the liability related to the transition tax, and foreign tax credits as provisional amounts based on information available as of December 31, 2017. As further regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities and as accounting treatment is clarified, additional work may be necessary to ensure earnings as required by the calculations are properly determined. As we perform additional analysis on the application of the law, and as we refine our estimates in calculating the effect, our final analysis may be different from current provisional amounts. Any changes to the provisional amounts will be recognized in the period completed which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. Additionally, as a result of the Tax Act, we have not completed our evaluation of its indefinite reinvestment assertion with regard to foreign earnings under ASC 740-30. As a result, deferred tax liabilities may be increased or decreased during the period allowed under SAB 118.\nThe effects of other provisions of the Tax Act are not expected to have a material impact on our Fiscal 2017 consolidated financial statements. Other provisions of the Tax Act may impact us in Fiscal 2018. These include the new section 951A Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ( GILTI\u201d) anti-deferral rules and the section 245A deduction for certain dividends received from foreign corporations. We have not completed its analysis of the effect of these provisions, hence no estimate can currently be made and no provisional amounts were recorded in the financial statements for the impact of these provisions of the Tax Act. Based on the current interpretation, we may choose a method as an accounting policy to record deferred taxes in relation to the GILTI provisions or to record the tax in the period in which it occurs. Pursuant to SAB 118, we have not elected an accounting policy for the effect of the GILTI tax law provisions.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRecently issued accounting standards not included below are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, an amendment to ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services and expands related disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-10 clarifies ASU 2014-09 to address the potential for diversity in practice at the adoption. ASUs 2016-10 and 2014-09 are effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early application is permitted.\nThe majority of our revenues are from food and beverage sales at our restaurants. ASU 2014-09 will not have an impact on revenue recognition related to food and beverage sales. ASU 2014-09 requires gift card breakage to be recognized as revenue in proportion to the pattern of gift card redemptions exercised by our customers. Currently, the Company records breakage income within other revenue.\nThe new guidance may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings as of the date of adoption (modified retrospective approach). We have elected the modified retrospective adoption method and plan to adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company has evaluated the impact of adoption on the recognition of license fee and other income related to the Company's joint ventures and does not believe the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This guidance requires the recognition of most leases on the balance sheet to give investors, lenders, and other financial statement users a more comprehensive view of a company's long-term financial obligations as well as the assets it owns versus leases. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Currently, all of our restaurant and our restaurant support center leases are accounted for as operating leases, and therefore are not recorded within our balance sheet. We expect this adoption will result in a material increase in the assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, but will likely have an insignificant impact on our consolidated statements of earnings. In preparation for the adoption of the guidance, we are implementing controls and key system changes to enable the preparation of financial information.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which provides financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To achieve this, the amendments in this ASU replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The measurement of expected credit losses will be based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The amendments in this ASU will be applied using a modified-retrospective approach and, for public entities, are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company has not yet evaluated the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,\u201d which clarifies and provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues that are not currently addressed by current GAAP. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-15 effective Fiscal 2018. Upon adoption there will be no impact on the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350).\u201d ASU 2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test. The amendment requires an entity to perform its annual, or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. A goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nJOBS Act\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if we comply with the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth from time to time, we may avail ourselves of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we are choosing to opt out of any extended transition period, and as a result we will seek to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company\u201d for up to five years following the completion of our initial public offering which will be June 2020, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.", "item_7_tables": "Table 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>
