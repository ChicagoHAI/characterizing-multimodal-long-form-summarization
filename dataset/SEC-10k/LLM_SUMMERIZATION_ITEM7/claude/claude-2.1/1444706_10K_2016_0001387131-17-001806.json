Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND PROJECTIONS\nThis annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but are based on current management expectations that involve substantial risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements relate to future events or our future financial performance.

In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this annual report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report on Form 10-K. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K.

Effective December 2, 2015, we changed our name from BDCA Venture, Inc. to Crossroads Capital, Inc. Effective January 1, 2010, we elected to be treated for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company ( RIC\u201d) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d). We commenced our portfolio company investment activities in January 2010. The shares of our common stock have been listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market since December 12, 2011 and we are currently traded under the ticker symbol XRDC\u201d.\nOur Investment Objective is to preserve capital and maximize stockholder value by pursuing the sale of our portfolio investments, limiting expenses and deploying surplus cash as appropriate, including into yielding investments to offset, in part, operating expenses and, as of March 25, 2016, to monetize our portfolio holdings at the earliest practicable date. On May 3, 2016, our Board of Directors approved the Plan, pursuant to which we plan to convert into a liquidating trust with the sole purpose of liquidating our assets and distributing the proceeds to our stockholders. The Plan is subject to the approval of our stockholders, which our Board of Directors intends to seek at a special meeting called for the purpose of approving the Plan and certain related matters, including the withdrawal of our election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and the delisting of our stock from Nasdaq Capital Market, as detailed in the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on May 5, 2016, which was subsequently amended on June 27, 2016. Our Board of Directors has not yet set a date for the special meeting. Prior to the approval by our stockholders and our conversion into the liquidating trust, our Board of Directors reserves the right to consider additional strategic alternatives. On August 24, 2016, as part of this strategy to liquidate the Company, we announced the engagement of Setter Capital, Inc., a Toronto-based secondary market advisory firm ( Setter Capital\u201d), to assist us in identifying prospective buyers for our portfolio investments.\nWe are internally managed, although we do receive certain administrative services from our Administrator, including the provision of personnel to act as certain of our executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\nFor the December 31, 2016 valuation of our portfolio investments that are not publicly traded, an independent valuation firm assisted our Board of Directors in its determination of the value of three investments in our portfolio. Our Administrator assisted our Board of Directors in its determination of the value of all of the investments in our portfolio and the funds held in escrow from the sale of investments ( Escrowed Funds\u201d).\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPortfolio Activity\nGiven the nature of investing in the securities of private companies, our investments generally will not have readily available market quotations. Generally, our equity investments in publicly traded companies in which the lockup restriction has expired are valued at the closing market price on the valuation date. However, equity investments in publicly traded portfolio companies which remain subject to lockup restrictions are valued in good faith by our Board of Directors based on a discount to the most recently available closing market prices. Our equity investments in private companies will not generally have readily available market quotations and, as such, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our Board of Directors, see Critical Accounting Policies\u201d below.\nWe had the following portfolio company activity during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTable 139: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>On January 13, 2016, Suniva closed a stock-for-stock merger transaction with Shunfeng International Clean Energy Limited, a Hong Kong Stock Exchange company ( SFCE\u201d), and a global integrated energy provider.

Our shares of SFCE common stock were subject to a lockup period which expired in February 2016. In August 2016, we completed the disposition of our entire position in SFCE, selling 820,686 shares of SFCE common stock in open market transactions for total net proceeds of $110,746, resulting in a net realized loss of $1,198,707. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>On January 15, 2016, $606,984 was released to us from the Xtime escrow without any offset for indemnity claims. As of December 31, 2016, we recognized $6,067 in additional proceeds in connection with the expense fund related to Xtime's merger transaction. These funds continue to be held in escrow and any remaining balance will be distributed to us on or around November 18, 2017 in accordance with the transaction agreements. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>On January 20, 2016, our Board of Directors approved and, on January 25, 2016, we signed an indication of interest to purchase additional Series B preferred stock in Harvest Power, Inc. as part of a pay-to-play\u201d extension offering of Series B preferred stock (the Series B Extension\u201d). On February 17, 2016, we purchased 244,039 shares of Series B preferred stock in Harvest Power for a total of $244,039. These newly purchased shares of Series B preferred stock have the same rights and preferences as our existing Series B preferred stock, with the exception that all of our Series B preferred stock now has a preferred-to-common conversion ratio of 1-to-1.5 versus 1-to-0.5301 previously. Any Series B stockholder that did not elect to purchase their pro rata share of the Series B Extension was subject to a mandatory conversion of their Series B preferred shares and Series A preferred shares into common stock. As part of this financing, participating stockholders were also offered the opportunity to purchase newly created Series B-1 preferred shares. We did not elect to purchase any Series B-1 preferred shares in this offering. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>On May 17, 2016, we completed an investment of $30,459 in BrightSource Energy as part of a rights offering of senior secured promissory notes to certain holders of BrightSource Energy preferred stock and its outstanding promissory notes.

Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating expenses. Net realized gain (loss), if any, is the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition of portfolio company investments or other relevant assets and their stated cost. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is the net change in the fair value of our portfolio company investments or other relevant assets.\nSet forth below are the results of operations comparing the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nInvestment Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we earned interest and dividend income from cash and cash equivalents of $128,420 and $8,446, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we also earned payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest of $46,896 on our convertible note and secured note investments in BrightSource. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we earned PIK interest of $39,985 on our convertible note and secured note investments in BrightSource.\nTo maintain our status as a RIC, PIK interest, which is a non-cash source of income, must generally be distributed to stockholders at least annually from other sources such as available cash or the proceeds from the disposition of our portfolio company investments. However, since we do not expect to have investment company taxable income, we would generally not be required to distribute PIK interest from our available cash or the proceeds from the disposition of our portfolio company investments.\nThe following table shows our PIK loan activity for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, at cost:\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Beginning PIK loan balance (inclusive of PIK interest capitalized) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>387,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>347,703 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Addition of PIK loans during period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>PIK interest accreted to principal during period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,985 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Ending PIK loan balance (inclusive of PIK interest capitalized) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>465,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>387,688 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased $30,459 of senior secured promissory notes in BrightSource with an interest rate of 11.5% and maturity date of March 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, the only notes with PIK interest that we held were issued by BrightSource. As of December 31, 2016, we were accruing PIK interest on each of our PIK loans, and none of our PIK loans were on non-accrual status.\nWe did not make any investments in PIK loans during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nThe composition of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were as follows.\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td>

$731,787 and $919,030, respectively, a decrease of $187,243 compared to the prior period due primarily to decreases in audit fees, legal fees and Sarbanes Oxley consulting fees, partially offset by increases in valuation services and accounting consulting fees compared to the prior period.\nAdministrator fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $750,495 and $180,000, respectively, an increase of $570,495 compared to the prior period primarily as a result of the engagement of our Administrator following the termination of our former Investment Advisory Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred base management fees of $1,232,563 and administrative expenses allocated from BDCA Venture Adviser of $423,628. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we also recorded a reduction of accrued incentive fees of $2,130,443.\nInvestment banking advisory fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $175,000 and $0, respectively, an increase of $175,000 compared to the prior period primarily as a result of the engagement of Setter Capital, Inc. to assist us in identifying prospective buyers for our portfolio investments during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nChief compliance officer fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $59,000 and $4,000, respectively, an increase of $55,000 compared to the prior period as a result of the engagement of our Chief Compliance Officer following the termination of our former Investment Advisory Agreement.\nDirectors fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $117,500 and $128,750, respectively, a decrease of $11,250 compared to the prior period due primarily to a decrease in the total number of members serving on our Board of Directors compared to the prior period, partially offset by an increase in the compensation paid to our Nominating Committee Chairman and Compensation Committee Chairman during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nPublic and investor relations expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $0 and $205,295, respectively, a decrease of $205,295 compared to the prior period due primarily to the proxy administrative and solicitation services expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the contested proxy campaign in connection with our 2015 Annual Meeting and a decrease in investor relations services previously provided by RCS Advisory Services, LLC ( RCS Advisory\u201d), an affiliated entity of BDCA Venture Adviser, compared to the prior period. RCS Advisory no longer provides us with services.\nBase management fees, accrued incentive fees and administrative expenses allocated from our investment adviser ended in connection with the termination of our former Investment Advisory Agreement in December 2015. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not pay any fees to an investment adviser. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred base management fees of $1,232,563 and administrative expenses allocated from BDCA Venture Adviser of $423,628. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we also recorded a reduction of accrued incentive fees of $2,130,443. No incentive fees were earned for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The increase of $600,605 in net investment loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily attributable to increases in administrator fees and investment banking advisory fees during the year ended December 31, 2016 and the reversal of incentive fees during the prior period, partially offset by decreases in base management fees, administrative expenses allocated from our former investment adviser, public and investor relations expenses and professional fees during the year ended December 31, 2016, as discussed above.\nBasic and diluted net investment loss per common share outstanding was $0.20 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to basic and diluted net investment loss per common share outstanding of $0.13 for the year ended December 31, 2015.

share was $1.18 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to basic and diluted net decrease in net assets resulting from operations per common share of $0.10 per common share for the year ended December 31, 2014. The weighted average common shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 9,739,237 and 9,729,764, respectively.\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $19.3 million as compared to $13.7 million and $27.4 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase of $5.7 million in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily the result of: (i) net proceeds from the sales of our portfolio investments of $7.4 million, (ii) the receipt of $0.6 million in Escrowed Funds from the Xtime escrow, (iii) repurchases of our common stock totaling $0.2 million, and (iv) net cash used in operating activities of $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had no indebtedness and accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.4 million as compared to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2014, we had no indebtedness and total accounts payable, accrued expenses and dividends payable of $7.2 million, including amounts owed to BDCA Venture Adviser.\nCapital Raising\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had 9,563,130 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.\nWe do not currently intend to raise additional common equity capital in the foreseeable future.\nRegulatory Compliance\nDue to the limited number of investments we currently hold, we closely monitor our asset composition in order to continue to satisfy the asset diversification test and maintain our status as a RIC. To maintain our status as a RIC, in addition to other requirements, as of the close of each quarter end, we must meet the asset diversification test, which requires that at least 50% of the value of our assets consist of cash, cash items, U.S. government securities or certain other qualified securities (the 50% Threshold\u201d). However, the failure to meet the 50% Threshold alone will not result in our loss of RIC status. In circumstances where the failure to meet the 50% Threshold is the result of fluctuations in the value of our assets, including as a result of the sale of assets, we will still be deemed to have satisfied the 50% Threshold and, therefore, maintain our RIC status, provided that we have not made any new investments in non-qualifying securities, including additional investments in non-qualifying securities of existing portfolio companies, since the time that we fell below the 50% Threshold. We satisfied the diversification test as of December 31, 2016. A more detailed description of our RIC status is located in Item 1. - Business - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nDistributions\nDistributions to our stockholders are payable only when and as declared by our Board of Directors and are paid out of assets legally available for distribution. We may fund cash distributions to stockholders from any sources of funds available to us. We have not established limits on the amount of funds we may use from available sources to make distributions.\nWe did not declare any distributions to stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2016. The following table summarizes our dividends declared for the year ended December 31, 2015:\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>Date Declared </td> <td> </td> <td>Record Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount Per Share </td> <td> </td> <td>Source of Distribution </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2015 Dividends: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 26, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>April 15, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>April 29, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td> </td> <td>Return of Capital </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 26, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 11, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 25, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td> </td> <td>Return of Capital </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 26, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 11, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 25, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td> </td> <td>Return of Capital </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 26, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 4, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 18, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td> </td> <td>Return of Capital </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total - 2015 Dividends </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDistribution Policy\nDistributions to our stockholders, if any, will be out of assets for distribution, as determined by our Board of Directors, with the intention of distributing up to 100% of the proceeds from the sales of our portfolio investments.\nOn March 25, 2016, our Board of Directors adopted a distribution policy with the objective to make special distributions to stockholders as declared by our Board of Directors in its discretion. Based on our Board of Directors' change to our investment objective to preserve capital and maximize stockholder value and resolution to monetize our portfolio holdings at the earliest practicable date, we will no longer pay regular quarterly distributions to our stockholders. Our Board of Directors may amend or terminate the distribution policy at any time.\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA more detailed description of our distribution policy is located in Item 5. - Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity - Distributions and Note 8 - Dividends and Distributions - to the financial statements of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nDividend Reinvestment Plan\nWe maintain a dividend reinvestment plan ( DRIP\u201d) that provides for the reinvestment of dividends on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder has elected to receive dividends in cash. As a result, if we declare a dividend, stockholders who have not opted out\u201d of the DRIP by the dividend record date will have their dividend automatically reinvested into additional shares of our common stock. Although we have a number of options to satisfy the share requirements of the DRIP, we currently expect that the shares required to be purchased under the DRIP will be acquired through open market purchases of common stock by the DRIP administrator. The shares purchased in the open market to satisfy the DRIP requirements will be valued based upon the average price of the applicable shares purchased by the DRIP administrator.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, we may enter into investment agreements under which we commit to make an investment in a portfolio company at some future date or over a specified period of time. As of December 31, 2016, we had not entered into any investment agreements which required us to make a future investment in a portfolio company.\nOn October 15, 2015, Suniva completed a stock-for-stock merger transaction with SFCE. Pursuant to the merger agreement, we are required to indemnify SFCE for certain breaches of warranties and representations made to SFCE, subject to a cap of approximately 12.5% of the merger consideration received by us. Any damages payable by us would be settled through an adjustment to the number of shares of common stock in the surviving company held by us and/or SFCE.\nOn November 18, 2014, Xtime, Inc., a private portfolio company, completed an all-cash merger transaction with Cox Automotive, Inc. At the closing of the merger, we were required to set aside approximately $809,311 in escrow as partial security for potential stockholder indemnification obligations under the merger agreement. The $809,311 represents additional proceeds that may be released to us at a later date subject to potential indemnity claims. On January 13, 2015, Escrowed Funds totaling $105,210 were released to us from the Xtime escrow without any offset for indemnity claims. On January 15, 2016, Escrowed Funds totaling $606,983 were released to us from the Xtime escrow without any offset for indemnity claims. As of December 31, 2016, we recognized $6,067 in additional proceeds in connection with the expense fund related to Xtime's merger transaction. The remaining funds held in the Xtime escrow are expected to be released in November of 2017, net of settlement of any indemnity claims. Although recovery under the stockholder indemnity obligation is generally limited to the escrow fund, we may be liable for our pro rata amount of any damages for certain types of indemnity claims not to exceed the cash consideration received by us, provided, however, in the case of our fraud or intentional misrepresentation, there is no limitation on liability. Except as discussed above, we have not been notified of any stockholder indemnity claims. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Escrowed Funds were fair valued at $94,907 and $688,082, respectively. See Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies.\nWe maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy (the D&O Policy\u201d) and an excess coverage policy (the Excess Policy\u201d) which provide liability insurance coverage for our officers and directors. We have also agreed to indemnify our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law subject to the restrictions in the 1940 Act.\nUnder our former Investment Advisory Agreement, absent the willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence of BDCA Venture Adviser or BDCA Venture Adviser's reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, we agreed to indemnify BDCA Venture Adviser (including its officers, managers, agents, employees and members of its investment committee) for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising out of BDCA Venture Adviser's performance of its duties and obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement, except to the extent specified in the 1940 Act. Pursuant to the former Investment Advisory Agreement, the indemnification provision shall remain in full force and effect, and BDCA Venture Adviser shall remain entitled to the benefits thereof, notwithstanding termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we and our officers and directors are not a party to any material legal proceedings. However, from time to time, we may be party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business including the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies.\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Developments\nPortfolio Company Activity\nOn March 29, 2017, we sold our entire investment in SilkRoad, which was acquired before the present Board of Directors was elected, consisting of 6,361,938 shares of Series D-1 convertible preferred stock, 19,132,283 shares of Series D-2 convertible preferred stock and 1,683,460 Series D-1 preferred stock warrants. The transaction was a secondary market sale for total net proceeds of $1,340,000, resulting in a net realized loss of $4,997,785.\nNasdaq Notice of Delisting\nOn January 6, 2017, we received a notice (the Notice\u201d) from the Listings Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market ( Nasdaq\u201d) stating that we did not hold an annual meeting of stockholders during the 12 months from the end our fiscal year on December 31, 2015, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rules 5620(a) and 5810(c)(2)(G).\nWe subsequently submitted a plan to regain compliance on February 17, 2017 pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules. The plan was accepted by Nasdaq on February 28, 2017, and we have been granted an extension to hold our annual meeting no later than June 29, 2017 to regain compliance with the applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules. If we fail to satisfy these terms, Nasdaq would provide written notification of the delisting of our securities, which we could appeal to a Nasdaq hearings panel pursuant to procedures set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nTabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations\nWe are currently not a party to any long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations or other long-term liabilities and thus have omitted the tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nWe have entered into agreements with MidFirst Bank to be the custodian of our portfolio securities and Frontier Bank to be the custodian of the majority of our cash and cash equivalent assets.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\nValuation of Investments\nOur investments generally consist of securities issued by private and publicly traded companies consisting of preferred stock, common stock, convertible notes, secured notes and warrants to purchase preferred stock which are included on our Schedule of Investments in the financial statements of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nInvestments are stated at value as defined under the 1940 Act, in accordance with the applicable regulations of the SEC, and in accordance with FASB, ASC 820. Value, as defined in Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, is: (i) the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available, and (ii) the fair value as determined in good faith by, or under the direction of, the Board of Directors for all other assets. See Note 3 - Portfolio Investments and Fair Value to the financial statements of this annual report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our portfolio investments and fair value. The 1940 Act requires periodic valuation of each investment in our portfolio to determine our net asset value. Under the 1940 Act, unrestricted securities with readily available market quotations are to be valued at the closing market price on the valuation date; all other assets must be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our Board of Directors.\nGiven the nature of investing in the securities of private companies, our investments are generally considered Level 3 assets under ASC 820 until these portfolio companies become public and begin trading on a stock exchange and the securities are no longer subject to any post-initial public offering lockup restrictions. As such, we value all of our investments, other than unrestricted securities in publicly traded portfolio companies, at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors, pursuant to a consistent valuation policy in accordance with the provisions of ASC 820 and the 1940 Act.\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDetermination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainty in determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments determined in good faith by our Board of Directors may differ significantly from the value that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and the differences could be material. Changes in fair value of these investments are recorded in our Statement of Operations as Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation).\u201d\nWe have a lead valuation director, who is a non-interested member of our Board of Directors and acts as the liaison between our Board of Directors and our management for valuing our investments. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Board of Directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\nTable 170: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>On a quarterly basis, each portfolio company will be analyzed based on the portfolio company's most recently available historical and projected financial results, public market comparables, equity or other transactions and other factors. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Our management or an independent valuation firm, if involved, will conduct appraisals and make an assessment of the fair value of each investment, which will be used in deriving a preliminary valuation. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Our lead valuation director will review and discuss the preliminary valuations with our management and the assistance of the independent valuation firm, if any. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Our Board of Directors will discuss the valuations and determine, in good faith, the fair value of each investment in our portfolio for which market quotations are not readily available based on the input of our management, the independent valuation firm, if any, and the lead valuation director. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the December 31, 2016 valuation of our portfolio investments that are not publicly traded, an independent valuation firm assisted our Board of Directors in its determination of the value of three investments in our portfolio.\nASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). In accordance with ASC 820, we use a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nTable 174: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Level 1: Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Level 2: Includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the financial statements of this annual report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of the framework for determining fair value as described above.\nAdministrative Services\nOn November 13, 2015, our Board of Directors approved the engagement of our Administrator to provide administrative consulting services to us, including the provision of personnel to act as certain of our executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, pursuant to an Administrator Consulting Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $741,000 and $180,000 of expenses related to the Administrator, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had expenses payable to the Administrator of $191,000 and $51,308, respectively.\nEffective December 2, 2015, we engaged the services of our Chief Compliance Officer. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $59,000 and $4,000, respectively, of compliance fees. Prior to the Termination Date, we also reimbursed BDCA Venture Adviser for the allocable portion of compensation of our Chief Compliance Officer during the year ended December 31, 2015, with such expense included in the payment of administrative expenses allocated from our former investment adviser for the period. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had expenses payable to our Chief Compliance Officer of $5,206 and $4,000, respectively.\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Transactions with Related Parties\nOn March 25, 2016, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors approved the reimbursement of $125,157 in legal and proxy solicitation costs incurred by Bulldog Investors, LLC ( Bulldog\u201d), a stockholder and beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, as a result of the contested proxy campaign in connection with our 2015 Annual Meeting. This reimbursement was paid to Bulldog on March 30, 2016 and included the costs of Bulldog's litigation against us in the Circuit Court of Maryland and the New York Supreme Court and costs associated with the proxy process and the election of our new Board of Directors. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors is required to review and approve any transactions with related parties (as such term is defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K).\nIn addition, our code of business conduct and ethics, which is applicable to all of our officers and directors, requires that all officers and directors avoid any conflict, or the appearance of a conflict, between an individual's personal interests and our interests. Our code of business conduct and ethics is available on our website at www.xroadscap.com.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this annual report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report on Form 10-K. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K. Except as required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated on May 9, 2008 under the laws of the State of Maryland and are an internally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Effective December 2, 2015, we changed our name from BDCA Venture, Inc. to Crossroads Capital, Inc. Effective January 1, 2010, we elected to be treated for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company ( RIC\u201d) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d). We commenced our portfolio company investment activities in January 2010. The shares of our common stock have been listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market since December 12, 2011 and we are currently traded under the ticker symbol XRDC\u201d.\nOur Investment Objective is to preserve capital and maximize stockholder value by pursuing the sale of our portfolio investments, limiting expenses and deploying surplus cash as appropriate, including into yielding investments to offset, in part, operating expenses and, as of March 25, 2016, to monetize our portfolio holdings at the earliest practicable date. On May 3, 2016, our Board of Directors approved the Plan, pursuant to which we plan to convert into a liquidating trust with the sole purpose of liquidating our assets and distributing the proceeds to our stockholders. The Plan is subject to the approval of our stockholders, which our Board of Directors intends to seek at a special meeting called for the purpose of approving the Plan and certain related matters, including the withdrawal of our election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and the delisting of our stock from Nasdaq Capital Market, as detailed in the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on May 5, 2016, which was subsequently amended on June 27, 2016. Our Board of Directors has not yet set a date for the special meeting. Prior to the approval by our stockholders and our conversion into the liquidating trust, our Board of Directors reserves the right to consider additional strategic alternatives. On August 24, 2016, as part of this strategy to liquidate the Company, we announced the engagement of Setter Capital, Inc., a Toronto-based secondary market advisory firm ( Setter Capital\u201d), to assist us in identifying prospective buyers for our portfolio investments.\nWe are internally managed, although we do receive certain administrative services from our Administrator, including the provision of personnel to act as certain of our executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\nFor the December 31, 2016 valuation of our portfolio investments that are not publicly traded, an independent valuation firm assisted our Board of Directors in its determination of the value of three investments in our portfolio. Our Administrator assisted our Board of Directors in its determination of the value of all of the investments in our portfolio and the funds held in escrow from the sale of investments ( Escrowed Funds\u201d).\n 35 \nPortfolio Activity\nGiven the nature of investing in the securities of private companies, our investments generally will not have readily available market quotations. Generally, our equity investments in publicly traded companies in which the lockup restriction has expired are valued at the closing market price on the valuation date. However, equity investments in publicly traded portfolio companies which remain subject to lockup restrictions are valued in good faith by our Board of Directors based on a discount to the most recently available closing market prices. Our equity investments in private companies will not generally have readily available market quotations and, as such, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our Board of Directors, see Critical Accounting Policies\u201d below.\nWe had the following portfolio company activity during the year ended December 31, 2016.\n \u25cf On January 13, 2016, Suniva closed a stock-for-stock merger transaction with Shunfeng International Clean Energy Limited, a Hong Kong Stock Exchange company ( SFCE\u201d), and a global integrated energy provider. As a result, our 10.022 shares of Series F preferred stock and 197.942 shares of Series D preferred stock were exchanged for 2,844 shares of Suniva Class A common stock and 820,868 shares of SFCE common stock. Our shares of SFCE common stock were subject to a lockup period which expired in February 2016. In August 2016, we completed the disposition of our entire position in SFCE, selling 820,686 shares of SFCE common stock in open market transactions for total net proceeds of $110,746, resulting in a net realized loss of $1,198,707. \n \u25cf On January 15, 2016, $606,984 was released to us from the Xtime escrow without any offset for indemnity claims. As of December 31, 2016, we recognized $6,067 in additional proceeds in connection with the expense fund related to Xtime's merger transaction. These funds continue to be held in escrow and any remaining balance will be distributed to us on or around November 18, 2017 in accordance with the transaction agreements. \n \u25cf On January 20, 2016, our Board of Directors approved and, on January 25, 2016, we signed an indication of interest to purchase additional Series B preferred stock in Harvest Power, Inc. as part of a pay-to-play\u201d extension offering of Series B preferred stock (the Series B Extension\u201d). On February 17, 2016, we purchased 244,039 shares of Series B preferred stock in Harvest Power for a total of $244,039. These newly purchased shares of Series B preferred stock have the same rights and preferences as our existing Series B preferred stock, with the exception that all of our Series B preferred stock now has a preferred-to-common conversion ratio of 1-to-1.5 versus 1-to-0.5301 previously. Any Series B stockholder that did not elect to purchase their pro rata share of the Series B Extension was subject to a mandatory conversion of their Series B preferred shares and Series A preferred shares into common stock. As part of this financing, participating stockholders were also offered the opportunity to purchase newly created Series B-1 preferred shares. We did not elect to purchase any Series B-1 preferred shares in this offering. \n \u25cf On May 17, 2016, we completed an investment of $30,459 in BrightSource Energy as part of a rights offering of senior secured promissory notes to certain holders of BrightSource Energy preferred stock and its outstanding promissory notes. Since we purchased our pro rata portion in the debt financing, 52,357 shares of Series 1A non-convertible preferred stock were automatically exchanged for 52,357 shares of Series 1 convertible preferred stock. In connection with the debt financing, the maturity date for the July 2014 and August 2014 promissory notes, which were issued to us in the initial principal amount of $107,977, and the convertible bridge notes, which were issued to us in the initial principal amount of $205,193, was extended to March 31, 2017. \n \u25cf In July and August 2016, we sold our remaining position in Tremor Video, selling 299,999 shares of Tremor Video common stock in open market transactions for total net proceeds of $582,613, resulting in a net realized loss of $1,417,384. \n \u25cf On August 9, 2016, Deem completed an initial closing of its Series CC-1 Preferred Stock financing (the Series CC-1 Financing\u201d). We did not participate in this offering. Pursuant to the Series CC-1 Financing, each share of outstanding preferred stock was automatically converted into common stock (the Conversion\u201d) and a 20-for-one reverse stock split was effected on all outstanding shares of common stock (the Reverse Split\u201d). As a result of the Conversion and Reverse Split, our 929,212 shares of Series AA-1 Convertible Preferred Stock were exchanged into 46,461 shares of Common Stock. \n \u25cf On September 15, 2016, Mode Media ceased operations and subsequently announced the assignment of substantially all the assets of Mode Media to its liquidating agent, Sherwood Partners, Inc., of Mountain View, CA. As of December 31, 2016, our securities in Mode Media had a fair value of $0. \n \u25cf On November 29, 2016, we sold 1,338,302 shares of our Metabolon Series D preferred stock in a secondary market sale for total net proceeds of $3,466,202, resulting in a net realized gain of $1,064,606. We continue to own 890,719 shares of Metabolon Series D preferred stock. \n 36 \n \u25cf On December 7, 2016, we sold our entire position of 1,084,873 shares of Centrify Series E convertible preferred stock in a secondary market sale for total net proceeds of $3,200,000, resulting in a net realized gain of $200,001. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, Setter Capital assisted us with the sale of our securities in Metabolon and Centrify. Setter Capital continues to assist us with the sale of our remaining portfolio investments. As a December 31, 2016, we had Investment banking advisory fees payable to Setter Capital of $175,000.\nThe following table summarizes the net realized gain (loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 for: (i) our portfolio company investments sold during each period, and (ii) our portfolio company investments and funds held in escrow from the sale of investments ( Escrowed Funds\u201d) held at the end of each period:\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Realized Gain (Loss) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Realized Gain (Loss) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Realized Gain (Loss) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Portfolio Company Investments Sold During Period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Metabolon, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,064,606 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,573,045 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Centrify Corporation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>200,001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(70,001 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Shunfeng International Clean Energy Ltd. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,198,707 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,127,463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tremor Video, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,417,384 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,381,999 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,182,240 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,139,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Xtime, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(487 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,930 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,511,947 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,830,000 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>TrueCar, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,519,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(720,004 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Kabam, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>671,140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(291,140 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Millennial Media, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,864 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(348,201 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,074,247 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Livescribe, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(606,186 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>606,186 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stoke, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,969,283 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,560,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Subtotal -

Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating expenses. Net realized gain (loss), if any, is the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition of portfolio company investments or other relevant assets and their stated cost. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is the net change in the fair value of our portfolio company investments or other relevant assets.\nSet forth below are the results of operations comparing the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nInvestment Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we earned interest and dividend income from cash and cash equivalents of $128,420 and $8,446, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we also earned payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest of $46,896 on our convertible note and secured note investments in BrightSource. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we earned PIK interest of $39,985 on our convertible note and secured note investments in BrightSource.\nTo maintain our status as a RIC, PIK interest, which is a non-cash source of income, must generally be distributed to stockholders at least annually from other sources such as available cash or the proceeds from the disposition of our portfolio company investments. However, since we do not expect to have investment company taxable income, we would generally not be required to distribute PIK interest from our available cash or the proceeds from the disposition of our portfolio company investments.\nThe following table shows our PIK loan activity for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, at cost:\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Beginning PIK loan balance (inclusive of PIK interest capitalized) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>387,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>347,703 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Addition of PIK loans during period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>PIK interest accreted to principal during period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,985 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Ending PIK loan balance (inclusive of PIK interest capitalized) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>465,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>387,688 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased $30,459 of senior secured promissory notes in BrightSource with an interest rate of 11.5% and maturity date of March 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, the only notes with PIK interest that we held were issued by BrightSource. As of December 31, 2016, we were accruing PIK interest on each of our PIK loans, and none of our PIK loans were on non-accrual status.\nWe did not make any investments in PIK loans during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nThe composition of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were as follows.\n 38 \nTable 154: <table> <tr>

$187,243 compared to the prior period due primarily to decreases in audit fees, legal fees and Sarbanes Oxley consulting fees, partially offset by increases in valuation services and accounting consulting fees compared to the prior period.\nAdministrator fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $750,495 and $180,000, respectively, an increase of $570,495 compared to the prior period primarily as a result of the engagement of our Administrator following the termination of our former Investment Advisory Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred base management fees of $1,232,563 and administrative expenses allocated from BDCA Venture Adviser of $423,628.

RCS Advisory no longer provides us with services.\nBase management fees, accrued incentive fees and administrative expenses allocated from our investment adviser ended in connection with the termination of our former Investment Advisory Agreement in December 2015. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not pay any fees to an investment adviser.

The increase of $600,605 in net investment loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily attributable to increases in administrator fees and investment banking advisory fees during the year ended December 31, 2016 and the reversal of incentive fees during the prior period, partially offset by decreases in base management fees, administrative expenses allocated from our former investment adviser, public and investor relations expenses and professional fees during the year ended December 31, 2016, as discussed above.\nBasic and diluted net investment loss per common share outstanding was $0.20 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to basic and diluted net investment loss per common share outstanding of $0.13 for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The aggregate cost and fair value of our Suniva Series F and Series D preferred stock as of December 31, 2015 was $2,554,287 and $355,000, respectively. For purposes of this presentation, the cost and fair value of our Suniva preferred stock as of December 31, 2015 has been allocated to the Suniva Class A common stock and SFCE common stock based on the final merger consideration received in the transaction. \nNet Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting From Operations and Per Share Information\nThe net decrease in our net assets resulting from operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $20,379,913, which included $1,345,417 in net realized losses and a net increase in unrealized depreciation of $17,143,896 during such period, compared to a net decrease in our net assets resulting from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $11,499,140, which included $1,157,446 in net realized losses and a net decrease in unrealized appreciation of $9,051,699 during such period.\nBasic and diluted net decrease in net assets resulting from operations per common share was $2.12 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to basic and diluted net decrease in net assets resulting from operations per common share of $1.18 per common share for the year ended December 31, 2015.

No incentive fee was due and payable to BDCA Venture Adviser as of the Termination Date, and, accordingly, the accrued incentive fee payable to BDCA Venture Adviser as of September 30, 2015 was reversed as of the Termination Date.

The decrease of $2,390,816 in net investment loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 is primarily attributable to decreases in incentive fees, base management fees and administrative expenses allocated from our former investment adviser, during the year ended December 31, 2015, which were partially offset by increases in professional fees and public and investor relations expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015, as discussed above.\nBasic and diluted net investment loss per common share outstanding was $0.13 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to basic and diluted net investment loss per common share outstanding of $0.38 for the year ended December 31, 2014.

The weighted average common shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 9,739,237 and 9,729,764, respectively.\n 44 \nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $19.3 million as compared to $13.7 million and $27.4 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase of $5.7 million in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily the result of: (i) net proceeds from the sales of our portfolio investments of $7.4 million, (ii) the receipt of $0.6 million in Escrowed Funds from the Xtime escrow, (iii) repurchases of our common stock totaling $0.2 million, and (iv) net cash used in operating activities of $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had no indebtedness and accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.4 million as compared to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2014, we had no indebtedness and total accounts payable, accrued expenses and dividends payable of $7.2 million, including amounts owed to BDCA Venture Adviser.\nCapital Raising\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had 9,563,130 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.\nWe do not currently intend to raise additional common equity capital in the foreseeable future.\nRegulatory Compliance\nDue to the limited number of investments we currently hold, we closely monitor our asset composition in order to continue to satisfy the asset diversification test and maintain our status as a RIC. To maintain our status as a RIC, in addition to other requirements, as of the close of each quarter end, we must meet the asset diversification test, which requires that at least 50% of the value of our assets consist of cash, cash items, U.S. government securities or certain other qualified securities (the 50% Threshold\u201d). However, the failure to meet the 50% Threshold alone will not result in our loss of RIC status. In circumstances where the failure to meet the 50% Threshold is the result of fluctuations in the value of our assets, including as a result of the sale of assets, we will still be deemed to have satisfied the 50% Threshold and, therefore, maintain our RIC status, provided that we have not made any new investments in non-qualifying securities, including additional investments in non-qualifying securities of existing portfolio companies, since the time that we fell below the 50% Threshold. We satisfied the diversification test as of December 31, 2016. A more detailed description of our RIC status is located in Item 1. - Business - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nDistributions\nDistributions to our stockholders are payable only when and as declared by our Board of Directors and are paid out of assets legally available for distribution. We may fund cash distributions to stockholders from any sources of funds available to us. We have not established limits on the amount of funds we may use from available sources to make distributions.\nWe did not declare any distributions to stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2016. The following table summarizes our dividends declared for the year ended December 31, 2015:\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>Date Declared </td> <td> </td> <td>Record Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount Per Share </td> <td> </td> <td>Source of Distribution </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2015 Dividends: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 26, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>April 15, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>April 29, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td> </td> <td>Return of Capital </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 26, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 11, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 25, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td> </td> <td>Return of Capital </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 26, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 11, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 25, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td> </td> <td>Return of Capital </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 26, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 4, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 18, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td> </td> <td>Return of Capital </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total - 2015 Dividends </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDistribution Policy\nDistributions to our stockholders, if any, will be out of assets for distribution, as determined by our Board of Directors, with the intention of distributing up to 100% of the proceeds from the sales of our portfolio investments.\nOn March 25, 2016, our Board of Directors adopted a distribution policy with the objective to make special distributions to stockholders as declared by our Board of Directors in its discretion. Based on our Board of Directors' change to our investment objective to preserve capital and maximize stockholder value and resolution to monetize our portfolio holdings at the earliest practicable date, we will no longer pay regular quarterly distributions to our stockholders. Our Board of Directors may amend or terminate the distribution policy at any time.\n 45 \nA more detailed description of our distribution policy is located in Item 5. - Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity - Distributions and Note 8 - Dividends and Distributions - to the financial statements of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nDividend Reinvestment Plan\nWe maintain a dividend reinvestment plan ( DRIP\u201d) that provides for the reinvestment of dividends on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder has elected to receive dividends in cash. As a result, if we declare a dividend, stockholders who have not opted out\u201d of the DRIP by the dividend record date will have their dividend automatically reinvested into additional shares of our common stock. Although we have a number of options to satisfy the share requirements of the DRIP, we currently expect that the shares required to be purchased under the DRIP will be acquired through open market purchases of common stock by the DRIP administrator. The shares purchased in the open market to satisfy the DRIP requirements will be valued based upon the average price of the applicable shares purchased by the DRIP administrator.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, we may enter into investment agreements under which we commit to make an investment in a portfolio company at some future date or over a specified period of time. As of December 31, 2016, we had not entered into any investment agreements which required us to make a future investment in a portfolio company.\nOn October 15, 2015, Suniva completed a stock-for-stock merger transaction with SFCE. Pursuant to the merger agreement, we are required to indemnify SFCE for certain breaches of warranties and representations made to SFCE, subject to a cap of approximately 12.5% of the merger consideration received by us. Any damages payable by us would be settled through an adjustment to the number of shares of common stock in the surviving company held by us and/or SFCE.\nOn November 18, 2014, Xtime, Inc., a private portfolio company, completed an all-cash merger transaction with Cox Automotive, Inc. At the closing of the merger, we were required to set aside approximately $809,311 in escrow as partial security for potential stockholder indemnification obligations under the merger agreement. The $809,311 represents additional proceeds that may be released to us at a later date subject to potential indemnity claims. On January 13, 2015, Escrowed Funds totaling $105,210 were released to us from the Xtime escrow without any offset for indemnity claims. On January 15, 2016, Escrowed Funds totaling $606,983 were released to us from the Xtime escrow without any offset for indemnity claims. As of December 31, 2016, we recognized $6,067 in additional proceeds in connection with the expense fund related to Xtime's merger transaction. The remaining funds held in the Xtime escrow are expected to be released in November of 2017, net of settlement of any indemnity claims. Although recovery under the stockholder indemnity obligation is generally limited to the escrow fund, we may be liable for our pro rata amount of any damages for certain types of indemnity claims not to exceed the cash consideration received by us, provided, however, in the case of our fraud or intentional misrepresentation, there is no limitation on liability. Except as discussed above, we have not been notified of any stockholder indemnity claims. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Escrowed Funds were fair valued at $94,907 and $688,082, respectively. See Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies.\nWe maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy (the D&O Policy\u201d) and an excess coverage policy (the Excess Policy\u201d) which provide liability insurance coverage for our officers and directors. We have also agreed to indemnify our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law subject to the restrictions in the 1940 Act.\nUnder our former Investment Advisory Agreement, absent the willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence of BDCA Venture Adviser or BDCA Venture Adviser's reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, we agreed to indemnify BDCA Venture Adviser (including its officers, managers, agents, employees and members of its investment committee) for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising out of BDCA Venture Adviser's performance of its duties and obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement, except to the extent specified in the 1940 Act. Pursuant to the former Investment Advisory Agreement, the indemnification provision shall remain in full force and effect, and BDCA Venture Adviser shall remain entitled to the benefits thereof, notwithstanding termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we and our officers and directors are not a party to any material legal proceedings. However, from time to time, we may be party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business including the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies.\n 46 \nRecent Developments\nPortfolio Company Activity\nOn March 29, 2017, we sold our entire investment in SilkRoad, which was acquired before the present Board of Directors was elected, consisting of 6,361,938 shares of Series D-1 convertible preferred stock, 19,132,283 shares of Series D-2 convertible preferred stock and 1,683,460 Series D-1 preferred stock warrants. The transaction was a secondary market sale for total net proceeds of $1,340,000, resulting in a net realized loss of $4,997,785.\nNasdaq Notice of Delisting\nOn January 6, 2017, we received a notice (the Notice\u201d) from the Listings Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market ( Nasdaq\u201d) stating that we did not hold an annual meeting of stockholders during the 12 months from the end our fiscal year on December 31, 2015, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rules 5620(a) and 5810(c)(2)(G).\nWe subsequently submitted a plan to regain compliance on February 17, 2017 pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules. The plan was accepted by Nasdaq on February 28, 2017, and we have been granted an extension to hold our annual meeting no later than June 29, 2017 to regain compliance with the applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules. If we fail to satisfy these terms, Nasdaq would provide written notification of the delisting of our securities, which we could appeal to a Nasdaq hearings panel pursuant to procedures set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nTabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations\nWe are currently not a party to any long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations or other long-term liabilities and thus have omitted the tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nWe have entered into agreements with MidFirst Bank to be the custodian of our portfolio securities and Frontier Bank to be the custodian of the majority of our cash and cash equivalent assets.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\nValuation of Investments\nOur investments generally consist of securities issued by private and publicly traded companies consisting of preferred stock, common stock, convertible notes, secured notes and warrants to purchase preferred stock which are included on our Schedule of Investments in the financial statements of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nInvestments are stated at value as defined under the 1940 Act, in accordance with the applicable regulations of the SEC, and in accordance with FASB, ASC 820. Value, as defined in Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, is: (i) the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available, and (ii) the fair value as determined in good faith by, or under the direction of, the Board of Directors for all other assets. See Note 3 - Portfolio Investments and Fair Value to the financial statements of this annual report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our portfolio investments and fair value. The 1940 Act requires periodic valuation of each investment in our portfolio to determine our net asset value. Under the 1940 Act, unrestricted securities with readily available market quotations are to be valued at the closing market price on the valuation date; all other assets must be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our Board of Directors.\nGiven the nature of investing in the securities of private companies, our investments are generally considered Level 3 assets under ASC 820 until these portfolio companies become public and begin trading on a stock exchange and the securities are no longer subject to any post-initial public offering lockup restrictions. As such, we value all of our investments, other than unrestricted securities in publicly traded portfolio companies, at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors, pursuant to a consistent valuation policy in accordance with the provisions of ASC 820 and the 1940 Act.\n 47 \nDetermination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainty in determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments determined in good faith by our Board of Directors may differ significantly from the value that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and the differences could be material. Changes in fair value of these investments are recorded in our Statement of Operations as Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation).\u201d\nWe have a lead valuation director, who is a non-interested member of our Board of Directors and acts as the liaison between our Board of Directors and our management for valuing our investments. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Board of Directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n \u25cf On a quarterly basis, each portfolio company will be analyzed based on the portfolio company's most recently available historical and projected financial results, public market comparables, equity or other transactions and other factors. \n \u25cf Our management or an independent valuation firm, if involved, will conduct appraisals and make an assessment of the fair value of each investment, which will be used in deriving a preliminary valuation. \n \u25cf Our lead valuation director will review and discuss the preliminary valuations with our management and the assistance of the independent valuation firm, if any. \n \u25cf Our Board of Directors will discuss the valuations and determine, in good faith, the fair value of each investment in our portfolio for which market quotations are not readily available based on the input of our management, the independent valuation firm, if any, and the lead valuation director. \nFor the December 31, 2016 valuation of our portfolio investments that are not publicly traded, an independent valuation firm assisted our Board of Directors in its determination of the value of three investments in our portfolio.\nASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). In accordance with ASC 820, we use a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\n \u25cf Level 1: Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets; \n \u25cf Level 2: Includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and \n \u25cf Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. \nIn instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the financial statements of this annual report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of the framework for determining fair value as described above.\nAdministrative Services\nOn November 13, 2015, our Board of Directors approved the engagement of our Administrator to provide administrative consulting services to us, including the provision of personnel to act as certain of our executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, pursuant to an Administrator Consulting Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $741,000 and $180,000 of expenses related to the Administrator, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had expenses payable to the Administrator of $191,000 and $51,308, respectively.\nEffective December 2, 2015, we engaged the services of our Chief Compliance Officer. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $59,000 and $4,000, respectively, of compliance fees. Prior to the Termination Date, we also reimbursed BDCA Venture Adviser for the allocable portion of compensation of our Chief Compliance Officer during the year ended December 31, 2015, with such expense included in the payment of administrative expenses allocated from our former investment adviser for the period. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had expenses payable to our Chief Compliance Officer of $5,206 and $4,000, respectively.\n 48 \nOther Transactions with Related Parties\nOn March 25, 2016, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors approved the reimbursement of $125,157 in legal and proxy solicitation costs incurred by Bulldog Investors, LLC ( Bulldog\u201d), a stockholder and beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, as a result of the contested proxy campaign in connection with our 2015 Annual Meeting. This reimbursement was paid to Bulldog on March 30, 2016 and included the costs of Bulldog's litigation against us in the Circuit Court of Maryland and the New York Supreme Court and costs associated with the proxy process and the election of our new Board of Directors. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors is required to review and approve any transactions with related parties (as such term is defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K).\nIn addition, our code of business conduct and ethics, which is applicable to all of our officers and directors, requires that all officers and directors avoid any conflict, or the appearance of a conflict, between an individual's personal interests and our interests. Our code of business conduct and ethics is available on our website at www.xroadscap.com.", "item_7_text": "Item 7.

In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this annual report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report on Form 10-K. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K. Except as required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated on May 9, 2008 under the laws of the State of Maryland and are an internally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Effective December 2, 2015, we changed our name from BDCA Venture, Inc. to Crossroads Capital, Inc. Effective January 1, 2010, we elected to be treated for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company ( RIC\u201d) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d). We commenced our portfolio company investment activities in January 2010. The shares of our common stock have been listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market since December 12, 2011 and we are currently traded under the ticker symbol XRDC\u201d.\nOur Investment Objective is to preserve capital and maximize stockholder value by pursuing the sale of our portfolio investments, limiting expenses and deploying surplus cash as appropriate, including into yielding investments to offset, in part, operating expenses and, as of March 25, 2016, to monetize our portfolio holdings at the earliest practicable date. On May 3, 2016, our Board of Directors approved the Plan, pursuant to which we plan to convert into a liquidating trust with the sole purpose of liquidating our assets and distributing the proceeds to our stockholders. The Plan is subject to the approval of our stockholders, which our Board of Directors intends to seek at a special meeting called for the purpose of approving the Plan and certain related matters, including the withdrawal of our election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and the delisting of our stock from Nasdaq Capital Market, as detailed in the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on May 5, 2016, which was subsequently amended on June 27, 2016. Our Board of Directors has not yet set a date for the special meeting. Prior to the approval by our stockholders and our conversion into the liquidating trust, our Board of Directors reserves the right to consider additional strategic alternatives. On August 24, 2016, as part of this strategy to liquidate the Company, we announced the engagement of Setter Capital, Inc., a Toronto-based secondary market advisory firm ( Setter Capital\u201d), to assist us in identifying prospective buyers for our portfolio investments.\nWe are internally managed, although we do receive certain administrative services from our Administrator, including the provision of personnel to act as certain of our executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\nFor the December 31, 2016 valuation of our portfolio investments that are not publicly traded, an independent valuation firm assisted our Board of Directors in its determination of the value of three investments in our portfolio. Our Administrator assisted our Board of Directors in its determination of the value of all of the investments in our portfolio and the funds held in escrow from the sale of investments ( Escrowed Funds\u201d).\n 35 \nPortfolio Activity\nGiven the nature of investing in the securities of private companies, our investments generally will not have readily available market quotations. Generally, our equity investments in publicly traded companies in which the lockup restriction has expired are valued at the closing market price on the valuation date. However, equity investments in publicly traded portfolio companies which remain subject to lockup restrictions are valued in good faith by our Board of Directors based on a discount to the most recently available closing market prices. Our equity investments in private companies will not generally have readily available market quotations and, as such, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our Board of Directors, see Critical Accounting Policies\u201d below.\nWe had the following portfolio company activity during the year ended December 31, 2016.\n \u25cf On January 13, 2016, Suniva closed a stock-for-stock merger transaction with Shunfeng International Clean Energy Limited, a Hong Kong Stock Exchange company ( SFCE\u201d), and a global integrated energy provider. As a result, our 10.022 shares of Series F preferred stock and 197.942 shares of Series D preferred stock were exchanged for 2,844 shares of Suniva Class A common stock and 820,868 shares of SFCE common stock. Our shares of SFCE common stock were subject to a lockup period which expired in February 2016. In August 2016, we completed the disposition of our entire position in SFCE, selling 820,686 shares of SFCE common stock in open market transactions for total net proceeds of $110,746, resulting in a net realized loss of $1,198,707. \n \u25cf On January 15, 2016, $606,984 was released to us from the Xtime escrow without any offset for indemnity claims. As of December 31, 2016, we recognized $6,067 in additional proceeds in connection with the expense fund related to Xtime's merger transaction. These funds continue to be held in escrow and any remaining balance will be distributed to us on or around November 18, 2017 in accordance with the transaction agreements. \n \u25cf On January 20, 2016, our Board of Directors approved and, on January 25, 2016, we signed an indication of interest to purchase additional Series B preferred stock in Harvest Power, Inc. as part of a pay-to-play\u201d extension offering of Series B preferred stock (the Series B Extension\u201d). On February 17, 2016, we purchased 244,039 shares of Series B preferred stock in Harvest Power for a total of $244,039. These newly purchased shares of Series B preferred stock have the same rights and preferences as our existing Series B preferred stock, with the exception that all of our Series B preferred stock now has a preferred-to-common conversion ratio of 1-to-1.5 versus 1-to-0.5301 previously. Any Series B stockholder that did not elect to purchase their pro rata share of the Series B Extension was subject to a mandatory conversion of their Series B preferred shares and Series A preferred shares into common stock. As part of this financing, participating stockholders were also offered the opportunity to purchase newly created Series B-1 preferred shares. We did not elect to purchase any Series B-1 preferred shares in this offering. \n \u25cf On May 17, 2016, we completed an investment of $30,459 in BrightSource Energy as part of a rights offering of senior secured promissory notes to certain holders of BrightSource Energy preferred stock and its outstanding promissory notes. Since we purchased our pro rata portion in the debt financing, 52,357 shares of Series 1A non-convertible preferred stock were automatically exchanged for 52,357 shares of Series 1 convertible preferred stock. In connection with the debt financing, the maturity date for the July 2014 and August 2014 promissory notes, which were issued to us in the initial principal amount of $107,977, and the convertible bridge notes, which were issued to us in the initial principal amount of $205,193, was extended to March 31, 2017. \n \u25cf In July and August 2016, we sold our remaining position in Tremor Video, selling 299,999 shares of Tremor Video common stock in open market transactions for total net proceeds of $582,613, resulting in a net realized loss of $1,417,384. \n \u25cf On August 9, 2016, Deem completed an initial closing of its Series CC-1 Preferred Stock financing (the Series CC-1 Financing\u201d).

Pursuant to the Series CC-1 Financing, each share of outstanding preferred stock was automatically converted into common stock (the Conversion\u201d) and a 20-for-one reverse stock split was effected on all outstanding shares of common stock (the Reverse Split\u201d). As a result of the Conversion and Reverse Split, our 929,212 shares of Series AA-1 Convertible Preferred Stock were exchanged into 46,461 shares of Common Stock. \n \u25cf On September 15, 2016, Mode Media ceased operations and subsequently announced the assignment of substantially all the assets of Mode Media to its liquidating agent, Sherwood Partners, Inc., of Mountain View, CA. As of December 31, 2016, our securities in Mode Media had a fair value of $0. \n \u25cf On November 29, 2016, we sold 1,338,302 shares of our Metabolon Series D preferred stock in a secondary market sale for total net proceeds of $3,466,202, resulting in a net realized gain of $1,064,606.

As a December 31, 2016, we had Investment banking advisory fees payable to Setter Capital of $175,000.\nThe following table summarizes the net realized gain (loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 for: (i) our portfolio company investments sold during each period, and (ii) our portfolio company investments and funds held in escrow from the sale of investments ( Escrowed Funds\u201d) held at the end of each period:\n\nPortfolio Composition\nThe total value of our investments was $9.2 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $34.7 million at December 31, 2015.\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our portfolio company investments by type of security and Escrowed Funds at cost and value as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\n\n 37 \nSee the Schedules of Investments in our financial statements for additional information regarding industry and headquarter locations of our portfolio companies.\nResults of Operations\nThe principal measure of our financial performance is the net increase (decrease) in our net assets resulting from operations, which is the sum of (i) net investment income (loss), (ii) net realized gain (loss), and (iii) the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating expenses. Net realized gain (loss), if any, is the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition of portfolio company investments or other relevant assets and their stated cost. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is the net change in the fair value of our portfolio company investments or other relevant assets.\nSet forth below are the results of operations comparing the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nInvestment Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we earned interest and dividend income from cash and cash equivalents of $128,420 and $8,446, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we earned PIK interest of $39,985 on our convertible note and secured note investments in BrightSource.\nTo maintain our status as a RIC, PIK interest, which is a non-cash source of income, must generally be distributed to stockholders at least annually from other sources such as available cash or the proceeds from the disposition of our portfolio company investments. However, since we do not expect to have investment company taxable income, we would generally not be required to distribute PIK interest from our available cash or the proceeds from the disposition of our portfolio company investments.\nThe following table shows our PIK loan activity for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, at cost:\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased $30,459 of senior secured promissory notes in BrightSource with an interest rate of 11.5% and maturity date of March 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, the only notes with PIK interest that we held were issued by BrightSource. As of December 31, 2016, we were accruing PIK interest on each of our PIK loans, and none of our PIK loans were on non-accrual status.\nWe did not make any investments in PIK loans during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nThe composition of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were as follows.\n 38 \n\nTotal operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $2,065,916 and $1,338,426, respectively, an increase of $727,490 compared to the prior period.\nProfessional fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $731,787 and $919,030, respectively, a decrease of $187,243 compared to the prior period due primarily to decreases in audit fees, legal fees and Sarbanes Oxley consulting fees, partially offset by increases in valuation services and accounting consulting fees compared to the prior period.\nAdministrator fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $750,495 and $180,000, respectively, an increase of $570,495 compared to the prior period primarily as a result of the engagement of our Administrator following the termination of our former Investment Advisory Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred base management fees of $1,232,563 and administrative expenses allocated from BDCA Venture Adviser of $423,628.

RCS Advisory no longer provides us with services.\nBase management fees, accrued incentive fees and administrative expenses allocated from our investment adviser ended in connection with the termination of our former Investment Advisory Agreement in December 2015.

The increase of $600,605 in net investment loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily attributable to increases in administrator fees and investment banking advisory fees during the year ended December 31, 2016 and the reversal of incentive fees during the prior period, partially offset by decreases in base management fees, administrative expenses allocated from our former investment adviser, public and investor relations expenses and professional fees during the year ended December 31, 2016, as discussed above.\nBasic and diluted net investment loss per common share outstanding was $0.20 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to basic and diluted net investment loss per common share outstanding of $0.13 for the year ended December 31, 2015.

To maintain our status as a RIC, in addition to other requirements, as of the close of each quarter end, we must meet the asset diversification test, which requires that at least 50% of the value of our assets consist of cash, cash items, U.S. government securities or certain other qualified securities (the 50% Threshold\u201d). However, the failure to meet the 50% Threshold alone will not result in our loss of RIC status. In circumstances where the failure to meet the 50% Threshold is the result of fluctuations in the value of our assets, including as a result of the sale of assets, we will still be deemed to have satisfied the 50% Threshold and, therefore, maintain our RIC status, provided that we have not made any new investments in non-qualifying securities, including additional investments in non-qualifying securities of existing portfolio companies, since the time that we fell below the 50% Threshold. We satisfied the diversification test as of December 31, 2016. A more detailed description of our RIC status is located in Item 1. - Business - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nDistributions\nDistributions to our stockholders are payable only when and as declared by our Board of Directors and are paid out of assets legally available for distribution. We may fund cash distributions to stockholders from any sources of funds available to us. We have not established limits on the amount of funds we may use from available sources to make distributions.\nWe did not declare any distributions to stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2016. The following table summarizes our dividends declared for the year ended December 31, 2015:\n\nDistribution Policy\nDistributions to our stockholders, if any, will be out of assets for distribution, as determined by our Board of Directors, with the intention of distributing up to 100% of the proceeds from the sales of our portfolio investments.\nOn March 25, 2016, our Board of Directors adopted a distribution policy with the objective to make special distributions to stockholders as declared by our Board of Directors in its discretion. Based on our Board of Directors' change to our investment objective to preserve capital and maximize stockholder value and resolution to monetize our portfolio holdings at the earliest practicable date, we will no longer pay regular quarterly distributions to our stockholders. Our Board of Directors may amend or terminate the distribution policy at any time.\n 45 \nA more detailed description of our distribution policy is located in Item 5. - Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity - Distributions and Note 8 - Dividends and Distributions - to the financial statements of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nDividend Reinvestment Plan\nWe maintain a dividend reinvestment plan ( DRIP\u201d) that provides for the reinvestment of dividends on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder has elected to receive dividends in cash. As a result, if we declare a dividend, stockholders who have not opted out\u201d of the DRIP by the dividend record date will have their dividend automatically reinvested into additional shares of our common stock. Although we have a number of options to satisfy the share requirements of the DRIP, we currently expect that the shares required to be purchased under the DRIP will be acquired through open market purchases of common stock by the DRIP administrator. The shares purchased in the open market to satisfy the DRIP requirements will be valued based upon the average price of the applicable shares purchased by the DRIP administrator.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, we may enter into investment agreements under which we commit to make an investment in a portfolio company at some future date or over a specified period of time. As of December 31, 2016, we had not entered into any investment agreements which required us to make a future investment in a portfolio company.\nOn October 15, 2015, Suniva completed a stock-for-stock merger transaction with SFCE. Pursuant to the merger agreement, we are required to indemnify SFCE for certain breaches of warranties and representations made to SFCE, subject to a cap of approximately 12.5% of the merger consideration received by us. Any damages payable by us would be settled through an adjustment to the number of shares of common stock in the surviving company held by us and/or SFCE.\nOn November 18, 2014, Xtime, Inc., a private portfolio company, completed an all-cash merger transaction with Cox Automotive, Inc. At the closing of the merger, we were required to set aside approximately $809,311 in escrow as partial security for potential stockholder indemnification obligations under the merger agreement. The $809,311 represents additional proceeds that may be released to us at a later date subject to potential indemnity claims. On January 13, 2015, Escrowed Funds totaling $105,210 were released to us from the Xtime escrow without any offset for indemnity claims. On January 15, 2016, Escrowed Funds totaling $606,983 were released to us from the Xtime escrow without any offset for indemnity claims. As of December 31, 2016, we recognized $6,067 in additional proceeds in connection with the expense fund related to Xtime's merger transaction. The remaining funds held in the Xtime escrow are expected to be released in November of 2017, net of settlement of any indemnity claims. Although recovery under the stockholder indemnity obligation is generally limited to the escrow fund, we may be liable for our pro rata amount of any damages for certain types of indemnity claims not to exceed the cash consideration received by us, provided, however, in the case of our fraud or intentional misrepresentation, there is no limitation on liability. Except as discussed above, we have not been notified of any stockholder indemnity claims. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Escrowed Funds were fair valued at $94,907 and $688,082, respectively. See Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies.\nWe maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy (the D&O Policy\u201d) and an excess coverage policy (the Excess Policy\u201d) which provide liability insurance coverage for our officers and directors. We have also agreed to indemnify our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law subject to the restrictions in the 1940 Act.\nUnder our former Investment Advisory Agreement, absent the willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence of BDCA Venture Adviser or BDCA Venture Adviser's reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, we agreed to indemnify BDCA Venture Adviser (including its officers, managers, agents, employees and members of its investment committee) for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising out of BDCA Venture Adviser's performance of its duties and obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement, except to the extent specified in the 1940 Act. Pursuant to the former Investment Advisory Agreement, the indemnification provision shall remain in full force and effect, and BDCA Venture Adviser shall remain entitled to the benefits thereof, notwithstanding termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we and our officers and directors are not a party to any material legal proceedings. However, from time to time, we may be party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business including the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies.\n 46 \nRecent Developments\nPortfolio Company Activity\nOn March 29, 2017, we sold our entire investment in SilkRoad, which was acquired before the present Board of Directors was elected, consisting of 6,361,938 shares of Series D-1 convertible preferred stock, 19,132,283 shares of Series D-2 convertible preferred stock and 1,683,460 Series D-1 preferred stock warrants. The transaction was a secondary market sale for total net proceeds of $1,340,000, resulting in a net realized loss of $4,997,785.\nNasdaq Notice of Delisting\nOn January 6, 2017, we received a notice (the Notice\u201d) from the Listings Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market ( Nasdaq\u201d) stating that we did not hold an annual meeting of stockholders during the 12 months from the end our fiscal year on December 31, 2015, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rules 5620(a) and 5810(c)(2)(G).\nWe subsequently submitted a plan to regain compliance on February 17, 2017 pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules. The plan was accepted by Nasdaq on February 28, 2017, and we have been granted an extension to hold our annual meeting no later than June 29, 2017 to regain compliance with the applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules. If we fail to satisfy these terms, Nasdaq would provide written notification of the delisting of our securities, which we could appeal to a Nasdaq hearings panel pursuant to procedures set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nTabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations\nWe are currently not a party to any long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations or other long-term liabilities and thus have omitted the tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nWe have entered into agreements with MidFirst Bank to be the custodian of our portfolio securities and Frontier Bank to be the custodian of the majority of our cash and cash equivalent assets.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\nValuation of Investments\nOur investments generally consist of securities issued by private and publicly traded companies consisting of preferred stock, common stock, convertible notes, secured notes and warrants to purchase preferred stock which are included on our Schedule of Investments in the financial statements of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nInvestments are stated at value as defined under the 1940 Act, in accordance with the applicable regulations of the SEC, and in accordance with FASB, ASC 820. Value, as defined in Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, is: (i) the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available, and (ii) the fair value as determined in good faith by, or under the direction of, the Board of Directors for all other assets. See Note 3 - Portfolio Investments and Fair Value to the financial statements of this annual report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our portfolio investments and fair value. The 1940 Act requires periodic valuation of each investment in our portfolio to determine our net asset value. Under the 1940 Act, unrestricted securities with readily available market quotations are to be valued at the closing market price on the valuation date; all other assets must be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our Board of Directors.\nGiven the nature of investing in the securities of private companies, our investments are generally considered Level 3 assets under ASC 820 until these portfolio companies become public and begin trading on a stock exchange and the securities are no longer subject to any post-initial public offering lockup restrictions. As such, we value all of our investments, other than unrestricted securities in publicly traded portfolio companies, at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors, pursuant to a consistent valuation policy in accordance with the provisions of ASC 820 and the 1940 Act.\n 47 \nDetermination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainty in determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments determined in good faith by our Board of Directors may differ significantly from the value that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and the differences could be material. Changes in fair value of these investments are recorded in our Statement of Operations as Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation).\u201d\nWe have a lead valuation director, who is a non-interested member of our Board of Directors and acts as the liaison between our Board of Directors and our management for valuing our investments. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Board of Directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n \u25cf On a quarterly basis, each portfolio company will be analyzed based on the portfolio company's most recently available historical and projected financial results, public market comparables, equity or other transactions and other factors. \n \u25cf Our management or an independent valuation firm, if involved, will conduct appraisals and make an assessment of the fair value of each investment, which will be used in deriving a preliminary valuation. \n \u25cf Our lead valuation director will review and discuss the preliminary valuations with our management and the assistance of the independent valuation firm, if any. \n \u25cf Our Board of Directors will discuss the valuations and determine, in good faith, the fair value of each investment in our portfolio for which market quotations are not readily available based on the input of our management, the independent valuation firm, if any, and the lead valuation director. \nFor the December 31, 2016 valuation of our portfolio investments that are not publicly traded, an independent valuation firm assisted our Board of Directors in its determination of the value of three investments in our portfolio.\nASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). In accordance with ASC 820, we use a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\n \u25cf Level 1: Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets; \n \u25cf Level 2: Includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and \n \u25cf Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. \nIn instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the financial statements of this annual report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of the framework for determining fair value as described above.\nAdministrative Services\nOn November 13, 2015, our Board of Directors approved the engagement of our Administrator to provide administrative consulting services to us, including the provision of personnel to act as certain of our executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, pursuant to an Administrator Consulting Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $741,000 and $180,000 of expenses related to the Administrator, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had expenses payable to the Administrator of $191,000 and $51,308, respectively.\nEffective December 2, 2015, we engaged the services of our Chief Compliance Officer. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $59,000 and $4,000, respectively, of compliance fees. Prior to the Termination Date, we also reimbursed BDCA Venture Adviser for the allocable portion of compensation of our Chief Compliance Officer during the year ended December 31, 2015, with such expense included in the payment of administrative expenses allocated from our former investment adviser for the period. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had expenses payable to our Chief Compliance Officer of $5,206 and $4,000, respectively.\n 48 \nOther Transactions with Related Parties\nOn March 25, 2016, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors approved the reimbursement of $125,157 in legal and proxy solicitation costs incurred by Bulldog Investors, LLC ( Bulldog\u201d), a stockholder and beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, as a result of the contested proxy campaign in connection with our 2015 Annual Meeting. This reimbursement was paid to Bulldog on March 30, 2016 and included the costs of Bulldog's litigation against us in the Circuit Court of Maryland and the New York Supreme Court and costs associated with the proxy process and the election of our new Board of Directors. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors is required to review and approve any transactions with related parties (as such term is defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K).\nIn addition, our code of business conduct and ethics, which is applicable to all of our officers and directors, requires that all officers and directors avoid any conflict, or the appearance of a conflict, between an individual's personal interests and our interests. Our code of business conduct and ethics is available on our website at www.xroadscap.com.", "item_7_tables": "Table 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr>
