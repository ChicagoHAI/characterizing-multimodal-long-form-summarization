Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAs used in this discussion and analysis, the words we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d and the Company\u201d are used to refer to Flushing Financial Corporation and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, Flushing Bank (the Bank\u201d), Flushing Preferred Funding Corporation, Flushing Service Corporation, and FSB Properties Inc.\nGeneral\nWe are a Delaware corporation organized in May 1994. The Bank was organized in 1929 as a New York State-chartered mutual savings bank. In 1994, the Bank converted to a federally chartered mutual savings bank and changed its name from Flushing Savings Bank to Flushing Savings Bank, FSB. The Bank converted from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank on November 21, 1995, at which time Flushing Financial Corporation acquired all of the stock of the Bank. On February 28, 2013, the Bank's charter was changed to a full-service New York State chartered commercial bank, and its name was changed to Flushing Bank. As a result of the Bank's change in charter to a full-service New York State chartered commercial bank, the Bank's primary regulator became the New York State Department of Financial Services, and its primary federal regulator became the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC\u201d). The Bank's deposits are insured to the maximum allowable amount by the FDIC. The Bank owns three subsidiaries: Flushing Preferred Funding Corporation, Flushing Service Corporation, and FSB Properties Inc.\nFlushing Financial Corporation also owns Flushing Financial Capital Trust II, Flushing Financial Capital Trust III, and Flushing Financial Capital Trust IV (the Trusts\u201d), which are special purpose business trusts formed during 2007 to issue a total of $60.0 million of capital securities, and $1.9 million of common securities (which are the only voting securities). Flushing Financial Corporation owns 100% of the common securities of the Trusts. The Trusts used the proceeds from the issuance of these securities to purchase junior subordinated debentures from Flushing Financial Corporation. The Trusts are not included in our consolidated financial statements as we would not absorb the losses of the Trusts if losses were to occur.\nThe following discussion of financial condition and results of operations includes the collective results of the Flushing Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company\u201d), but reflects principally the Bank's activities. Management views the Company as operating as a single unit - a community bank. Therefore, segment information is not provided.\nThe Bank has a business banking unit which focuses on the development of a full complement of commercial business deposit, loan and cash management products. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the business banking unit had $613.0 million and $525.3 million, respectively, in gross loans outstanding and $144.4 million and $146.3 million, respectively, of customer deposits.\nThe Bank has an internet branch, iGObanking.com\u00ae, which provides access to consumers in markets outside our geographic locations. Accounts can be opened online at www.iGObanking.com or by mail. IGObanking.com\u00ae does not currently accept loan applications. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, iGObanking.com\u00ae had $417.3 million and $323.7 million, respectively, of customer deposits.\nThe Bank has a governmental banking unit, which provides banking services to public entities including counties, cities, towns, villages, school districts, libraries, fire districts and the various courts throughout the New York City metropolitan area. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the government banking unit had $1,062.1 million and $975.9 million, respectively, in customer deposits.\nOverview\nOur principal business is attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those deposits together with funds generated from ongoing operations and borrowings, primarily in (1) originations and purchases of multi-family residential properties, commercial business loans, commercial real estate mortgage loans and, to a lesser extent, one-to-four family (focusing on mixed-use properties, which are properties that contain both residential dwelling units and commercial units); (2) construction loans, primarily for residential properties; (3) Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) loans and other small business loans; (4) mortgage loan surrogates such as mortgage-backed securities; and (5) U.S. government securities, corporate fixed-income securities and other marketable securities. We also originate certain other consumer loans including overdraft lines of credit. Our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on its interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the result of our interest rate margin, which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, adjusted for the difference in the average balance of interest-earning assets as compared to the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. We also generate non-interest income from loan fees, service charges on deposit accounts, mortgage servicing fees, and other fees, income earned on Bank Owned Life Insurance ( BOLI\u201d), dividends on Federal Home Bank of New York ( FHLB-NY\u201d) stock and net gains and losses on sales of securities and loans. Our operating expenses consist principally of employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, other general and administrative expenses and income tax expense. Our results of operations also can be significantly affected by our periodic provision for loan losses and specific provision for losses on real estate owned.\nTable 118: <table><tr><td>58 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement Strategy. Our strategy is to continue our focus on being an institution serving consumers, businesses, and governmental units in our local markets. In furtherance of this objective, we intend to:\nTable 119: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Increase core deposits and continue to improve funding mix; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>increase net interest income by leveraging loan pricing opportunities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>enhance earnings by managing net interest margin and improving scalability and efficiency; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>manage credit risk; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>maintain well capitalized levels under all stress test scenarios; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>increase our commitment to the multi-cultural marketplace, with a particular focus on the Asian community in Queens; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>manage enterprise-wide risk. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively implement this strategy. Our strategy is subject to change by the Board of Directors.\nIncrease core deposits and continue to improve funding mix. We have a relatively stable retail deposit base drawn from our market area through our full-service offices. Although we seek to retain existing deposits and maintain depositor relationships by offering quality service and competitive interest rates to our customers, we also seek to keep deposit growth within reasonable limits and our strategic plan. In order to implement our strategic plan, we have built multi-channel deposit gathering capabilities. The business banking operation was designed specifically to develop full business relationships thereby bringing in lower-costing checking and money market deposits. At December 31, 2016, deposits balances in the business sector are $144.4 million. We also have iGObanking.com\u00ae\u201d, as a division of the Bank, to compete for deposits from sources outside the geographic footprint of our full-service offices. In creating iGObanking.com\u00ae, our strategy is to reduce our reliance on wholesale borrowings and reduce our funding costs. Deposit balances in iGObanking.com\u00ae were $417.3 million at December 31, 2016, at rates lower than our borrowings. We have a government banking division as an additional source of deposits. At December 31, 2016, deposits in our government banking division totaled $1,062.1 million at rates below our average cost of funds. We also obtain deposits through brokers and the CDARS\u00ae and ICS network. Management intends to balance its goal to maintain competitive interest rates on deposits while seeking to manage its overall cost of funds to finance its strategies. We generally rely on our deposit base as our principal source of funding. During 2016, we realized an increase in due to depositors of $309.7 million, as core deposits increased $340.9 million while certificates of deposit decreased $31.2 million.\nA significant portion of our lending and deposit customers do not have both their loans and deposits with us. We intend to continue to focus on obtaining additional deposits from our lending customers and originating additional loans to our deposit customers. Product offerings were expanded and are expected to be further expanded to accommodate perceived customer demands. In addition, specific employees are assigned responsibilities of generating these additional deposits and loans by coordinating efforts between lending and deposit gathering departments.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td>59 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncrease net interest income by leveraging loan pricing opportunities. During 2016, we repositioned our strategy to focus more on loan pricing as opposed to volume. We saw yields on originations increase for the third and fourth quarters of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The average interest rate obtained for third quarter 2016 originations was 3.74% as compared to 3.56% for the 2015 period. For fourth quarter 2016 originations, the average interest rate increased 13 basis points to 3.81% as compared to 3.68% for the 2015 period.\nWe have emphasized the strategic growth of multi-family residential mortgage loans and floating rate commercial business loans. We have re-entered the higher-yielding non-owner occupied commercial real estate lending during 2015. We continued to deemphasize one-to-four family - mixed-use property and construction lending and we no longer provide taxi medallion loans.\nThe following table shows loan originations and purchases during 2016, and loan balances as of December 31, 2016.\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Loan </td> <td> </td> <td>Loan Balances </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Originations and </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Purchases </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross Loans </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Multi-family residential </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>371,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,178,504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>322,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,246,132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.86 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>One-to-four family - mixed-use property </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>558,502 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.59 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>One-to-four family - residential </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>185,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.85 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Co-operative apartment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,772 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Small Business Administration </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Taxi Medallion </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.39 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial Business and Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>326,776 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>597,122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.39 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,132,938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,819,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2016, multi-family residential, commercial business and other loans and commercial real estate loans, totaled 83.5% of our gross loans. We have repositioned our loan growth since the Great Recession to reduce credit risk; however, our concentration in these types of loans could require us to increase our provisions for loan losses and to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance currently maintained.\nEnhance earnings by managing net interest margin and improving scalability and efficiency. By taking advantage of loan pricing opportunities and continuing to maintain a lower cost of funds, we actively manage the net interest margin. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased one basis point to 1.07% from 1.08% for the year ended December 31, 2015. During 2017, approximately 47% of our borrowings and certificates of deposits are scheduled to mature or reprice. During 2016, we renovated two branches to the Universal Banker model and plan to renovate three branches during 2017. The Universal Banker model will result in savings of both personnel and occupancy costs while providing our customers with cutting-edge technology.\nManage credit risk. By adherence to our conservative underwriting standards, we have been able to minimize net losses from impaired loans, recording net recoveries of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net charge-offs of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The loan to value for the real estate dependent loan portfolio was 40.5% and the average loan to value for non-performing loans collateralized by real estate was 39.1% at December 31, 2016. We seek to maintain our loans in performing status through, among other things, disciplined collection efforts, and consistently monitoring non-performing assets in an effort to return them to performing status. To this end, we review the quality of our loans and report to the Loan Committee of the Board of Directors of the Bank on a monthly basis. We sold 26 delinquent loans totaling $8.0 million, 23 delinquent loans totaling $9.0 million, and 34 delinquent loans totaling $15.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We recorded net recoveries on delinquent loans that were sold during 2016, 2015 and 2014 of $48,000, $0.1 million and $0.4 million. We realized gross gains of $0.3 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million on the sale of delinquent loans for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We realized gross losses of $2,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. We did not record any gross losses during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2014. There can be no assurances that we will continue this strategy in future periods, or if continued, we will be able to find buyers to pay adequate consideration. Non-performing loans totaled $21.9 million and $31.0 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.36% and 0.54% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nTable 128: <table><tr><td>60 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMaintain well capitalized levels under all stress test scenarios. The Bank faces several minimum capital requirements imposed by federal regulation. Failure to adhere to these minimums could limit the dividends the Bank is allowed to pay, including the payment of dividends to Flushing Financial Corporation, and could limit the annual growth of the Bank. Under the Dodd Frank Act, banks with assets greater than $10.0 billion in total assets are required to complete stress tests, which predict capital levels under certain stress levels. Although, our total assets are currently $6.1 billion, as a best practice, we completed these tests. As of December 31, 2016, under all stress scenarios, we remain well capitalized per current regulations.\nIncrease Our Commitment to the Multi-Cultural Marketplace, with a Particular Focus on the Asian Community in Queens. Our branches are all located in the New York City metropolitan area with particular concentration in the borough of Queens. Queens is characterized with a high level of ethnic diversity. An important element of our strategy is to service multi-ethnic consumers and businesses. We have a particular presence and concentration in Asian communities, including in particular the Chinese and Korean populations. Both groups are noted for high levels of savings, education and entrepreneurship. In order to service these and other important ethnic groups in our market, our staff speaks more than 30 languages. We have an Asian advisory board to help broaden our links to the community by providing guidance and fostering awareness of our active role in the local community. Through our focus on and commitment to the Asian community in Queens, where we have four branches, we have obtained approximately $500 million in deposits in these branches. We also have over $450 million of loans and lines of credit outstanding to borrowers in the Asian community.\nManage Enterprise-Wide Risk. We identify, measure and attempt to mitigate risks that affect, or have the potential to affect, our business. Due to past economic crises and recent increases in government regulation, we devote significant resources to risk management. We have a seasoned risk officer to provide executive risk leadership, and an enterprise-wide risk management program. Several enterprise risk management analytical products are in use which include key risk indicators. We also have had a chief information security officer even before one will be required by recent NYDFS rulemaking not yet in effect. Our management of enterprise-wide risk enables us to recognize and monitor risks and establish procedures to disseminate the risk information across our organization and to our Board of Directors. The objective is to have a robust and focused risk management process capable of identifying and mitigating emerging threats to the Bank's safety and soundness.\nTrends and Contingencies. Our operating results are significantly affected by national and local economic and competitive conditions, including changes in market interest rates, the strength of the local economy, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. We have remained strategically focused on the origination of multi-family residential mortgages and to a lesser extent, commercial real estate and one-to-four family mixed-use property mortgage loans. However, in late 2014 and throughout 2015 and 2016 we have increased our emphasis on the origination and purchase of business loans with full banking relationships and commercial real estate loans. As a result of this strategy, we were able to continue to achieve a higher yield on our mortgage portfolio than we would have otherwise experienced.\nAs we have seen improvements in the local economy, our non-performing loans have decreased. The majority of our impaired loans are income producing residential properties located in the New York City metropolitan market. Due to the low vacancy rates for these types of properties, they have retained more of their value, thereby reducing their loss content. Non-performing loans totaled $21.4 million, $26.1 million and $34.2 million at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We have not experienced a significant increase in foreclosed properties despite an extended foreclosure process in our market. The extended foreclosure process in our market is due to the high number of foreclosure actions filed in the court system in the counties for which we are seeking foreclosure on delinquent mortgage loans. We have not encountered significant issues with documentation relating to mortgages for which we are seeking foreclosure as we maintain custody of all loan documents and review them prior to providing them to our legal counsel to initiate the foreclosure action. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded net recoveries of $0.7 million compared to net charge-offs of $2.6 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This improvement in net charge-offs allowed us to not record a provision for loan losses during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to benefits of $1.0 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We cannot predict the effect of these economic conditions on the Company's future financial condition or operating results.\nTable 129: <table><tr><td>61 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoan originations and purchases were $1,132.9 million, $1,233.5 million and $958.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. While we primarily rely on originating our own loans, we purchased $186.7 million, $278.9 million and $169.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We purchase loans when the loans complement our loan portfolio strategy. Loans purchased must meet our underwriting standards when they were originated.\nDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, the allocation of our loan portfolio has remained fairly consistent. The majority of our loans are collateralized by real estate, which comprised 86.9% of our portfolio at December 31, 2016 compared to 87.7% at December 31, 2015 and 87.4% at December 31, 2014. Multi-family residential mortgage loans comprised 45.2%, 47.0% and 50.6% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Commercial real estate mortgage loans comprised 25.9%, 22.9% and 16.4% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. One-to-four family mixed-use property mortgage loans comprised 11.6%, 13.1% and 15.1% of loan portfolio at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. One-to-four family residential mortgage loans comprised 3.9%, 4.3% and 4.9% of loan portfolio at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDue to depositors increased $309.7 million, $382.8 million and $272.9 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Lower-costing core deposits increased $340.9 million, $285.3 million and $88.1 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Higher-costing certificates of deposit decreased $31.2 million during 2016 compared to increases $97.5 million during 2015 and $184.9 million during 2014. Brokered deposits represented 26.5%, 25.2% and 21.8% of total deposits at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nPrevailing interest rates affect the extent to which borrowers repay and refinance loans. In a declining interest rate environment, the number of loan prepayments and loan refinancing tends to increase, as do prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. Call provisions associated with our investments in U.S. government agency and corporate securities may also adversely affect yield in a declining interest rate environment. Such prepayments and calls may adversely affect the yield of our loan portfolio and mortgage-backed and other securities as we reinvest the prepaid funds in a lower interest rate environment. However, we typically receive additional loan fees when existing loans are refinanced, which partially offsets the reduced yield on our loan portfolio resulting from prepayments. In periods of low interest rates, our level of core deposits also may decline if depositors seek higher-yielding instruments or other investments not offered by us, which in turn may increase our cost of funds and decrease our net interest margin to the extent alternative funding sources, are utilized. By contrast, an increasing interest rate environment would tend to extend the average lives of lower yielding fixed rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, which could adversely affect net interest income. In addition, depositors tend to open longer term, higher costing certificate of deposit accounts which could adversely affect our net interest income if rates were to subsequently decline. Additionally, adjustable rate residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities generally contain interim and lifetime caps that limit the amount the interest rate can increase at re-pricing dates.\nWe attempt to pursue the guarantor on all loans for which a loss has been incurred and for which a guarantee was obtained, when, after considering the benefits and costs, we have concluded we will be successful in recovering at least a portion of the loss we incurred. The success of this pursuit is based on the assets the guarantor holds when we obtain a judgment.\nDuring 2016, we sought performance under guarantees on three business loans, seeking judgment of approximately $3.6 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had received $6,000 on these business loans. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we realized recoveries of approximately $50,000 on business loans for which we sought judgments prior to 2016. During 2015, we sought performance under guarantees on two business loans, seeking judgment of approximately $2.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we realized recoveries of approximately $0.3 million on business loans and $0.1 million on real estate mortgage loans for which we sought judgments prior to 2015.\nTable 130: <table><tr><td>62 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2016 our net interest income increased $12.7 million, or 8.20%, to $167.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from $154.4 million for the comparable prior year period, as a seven basis point decrease in the net interest margin to 2.97% for the twelve month ended December 31, 2016 was more than offset by balance sheet growth. The decrease in the net interest margin for 2016 was primarily due to a decline in the yield of our interest-earning assets, partially offset by a reduction in our funding costs. The decline in the yield of our interest earning assets was primarily due to rates earned on new loans originated and securities purchased during 2016 being lower than the yield of the existing portfolio. During 2016, the average balance of total loans, net increased $567.2 million to $4,600.7 million. During 2016, the average balance of borrowed funds increased by $126.6 million to $1,231.0 million compared to $1,104.4 million for 2015, while the cost of borrowed funds decreased nine basis points to 1.67% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 1.76% in the comparable period. The cost of certificates of deposit accounts decreased nine basis points for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from the prior year, while the cost of money market accounts, NOW and savings accounts increased 21 basis points, seven basis points and four basis points, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from the prior year. The cost of money market accounts increased primarily due to our shifting of Government NOW deposits to an Insured Cash Sweep service ( ICS\u201d) brokered money market product, which does not require us to provide collateral. This allows us to invest our funds in higher yielding assets. The cost of savings and NOW accounts increased as we increased the rates we pay on certain accounts to attract additional deposits. This resulted in an increase in the cost of due to depositors of one basis point to 0.89% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from 0.88% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Overall, as a result of these changes to our funding mix we were able to reduce our cost of interest-bearing liabilities one basis point to 1.07% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 1.08% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe are unable to predict the direction or timing of future interest rate changes. Approximately 47% of our certificates of deposit accounts and borrowings reprice or mature during the next year, which could result in a decrease in the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Also, in a decreasing interest rate environment, mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities with higher rates tend to prepay, which could result in a reduction in the yield on our interest-earning assets.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity Analysis\nA financial institution's exposure to the risks of changing interest rates may be analyzed, in part, by examining the extent to which its assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive\u201d and by monitoring the institution's interest rate sensitivity gap.\u201d An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period. Accordingly, a positive gap may enhance net interest income in a rising rate environment and reduce net interest income in a falling rate environment. Conversely, a negative gap may enhance net interest income in a falling rate environment and reduce net interest income in a rising rate environment.\nThe table below sets forth the amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding at December 31, 2016 which are anticipated by the Company, based upon certain assumptions, to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except as stated below, the amount of assets and liabilities shown that reprice or mature during a particular period was determined in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability. Prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities are based on our experience and industry averages, which generally range from 6% to 36%, depending on the contractual rate of interest and the underlying collateral. Money market accounts and savings accounts were assumed to have a withdrawal or run-off\u201d rate of 14% and 23%, respectively, based on our experience.

accounts totaling $333.2 million at December 31, 2016.\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar estimated maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in differing degrees to changes in market interest rates and may bear rates that differ in varying degrees from the rates that would apply upon maturity and reinvestment or upon repricing. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as ARM loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a significant change in the level of interest rates, prepayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities, and deposit withdrawal or run-off\u201d levels, would likely deviate materially from those assumed in calculating the above table. In the event of an interest rate increase, some borrowers may be unable to meet the increased payments on their adjustable-rate debt. The interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes that the nature of the Company's assets and liabilities remains static. Interest rates may have an effect on customer preferences for deposits and loan products. Finally, the maturity and repricing characteristics of many assets and liabilities as set forth in the above table are not governed by contract but rather by management's best judgment based on current market conditions and anticipated business strategies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in fair value of certain investments due to changes in interest rates. Generally, the fair value of financial investments such as loans and securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. As a result, increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the fair value of our interest-earning assets which could adversely affect our results of operations if such assets were sold, or, in the case of securities classified as available for sale, decreases in our stockholders' equity if such securities were retained.\nTable 133: <table><tr><td>64 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe manage the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities on a continuous basis to maximize return and adjust our exposure to interest rate risk. On a quarterly basis, management prepares the Earnings and Economic Exposure to Changes in Interest Rate\u201d report for review by the Board of Directors, as summarized below. This report quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and net portfolio value should interest rates go up or down (shocked) 200 basis points, assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other. Net portfolio value is defined as the market value of assets net of the market value of liabilities. The market value of assets and liabilities is determined using a discounted cash flow calculation. The net portfolio value ratio is the ratio of the net portfolio value to the market value of assets. All changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and net portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario. The base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at December 31, 2015. Various estimates regarding prepayment assumptions are made at each level of rate shock. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. At December 31, 2016, we were within the guidelines established by the Board of Directors for each interest rate level.\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Projected Percentage Change In </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Portfolio </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in Interest Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Interest Income </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Portfolio Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Value Ratio </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>-200 basis points </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.74 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-1.87 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.79 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.76 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.05 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>-100 basis points </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.03 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Base interest rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.57 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>+100 basis points </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-6.38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-4.96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-11.56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-11.34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.57 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>+200 basis points </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-13.97 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-10.45 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-26.43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-26.30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnalysis of Net Interest Income\nNet interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends upon the relative amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them.\nThe following table sets forth certain information relating to our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. Average balances are derived from average daily balances. The yields include amortization of fees that are considered adjustments to yields.\nTable 135: <table><tr><td>65 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the year

Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $64.9 million, an increase of $18.7 million, or 40.48%, compared to $46.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Diluted earnings per common share were $2.24 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $0.65, or 40.88%, from $1.59 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nReturn on average equity increased to 13.07% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, from 9.93% for the prior year. Return on average assets increased to 1.10% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, from 0.86% for the prior year.\nInterest Income. Interest income increased $16.9 million, or 8.25%, to $221.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $204.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase of $542.6 million in the average balance of interest-earning assets to $5,626.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $5,084.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was partially offset by a nine basis point reduction in the yield of interest-earning assets to 3.93% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 4.02% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The nine basis point decline in the yield of interest-earning assets was primarily due to a 19 basis point reduction in the yield on the loan portfolio to 4.24% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from 4.43% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by a 10 basis point increase in the yield on total securities to 2.65% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from 2.55% for the prior year. The 19 basis point decrease in the yield on the loan portfolio was primarily due to a decline in the rates earned on new loan originations and existing loans modified to lower rates. The 10 basis point increase in the yield on the securities portfolio was primarily due to the purchase of new securities at higher yields than the existing portfolio. The yield on the loan portfolio, excluding prepayment penalty income on loans, decreased 17 basis points to 4.10% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from 4.27 % for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nTable 145: <table><tr><td>67 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $4.2 million, or 8.42%, to $53.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase of $449.5 million in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities to $5,036.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $4,586.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was partially offset by a decrease of one basis point in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 1.07% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 1.08% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The one basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily attributable to decreases of nine basis points in each of the cost of certificates of deposit and borrowed funds. The decrease in the cost of certificates of deposit and borrowed funds was primarily due to maturing issuances being replaced at lower rates. Additionally, the cost of borrowed funds benefited from the early extinguishment of $130.0 million in FHLB-NY advances at an average cost of 2.82% and $78.0 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase, at an average cost of 3.80% during 2016. These decreases were partially offset by increases of 21 basis points, seven basis points and four basis points in the cost of money market, NOW and savings accounts, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from the comparable prior year period. The cost of money market accounts increased primarily due to our shifting of Government NOW deposits to a money market product which does not require us to provide collateral, allowing us to invest these funds in higher yielding assets. The cost of NOW and savings accounts increased as we increased the rate we pay on some of our products to attract additional deposits. Additionally, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was negatively affected by increases of $126.6 million and $58.2 million in the average balance of higher costing borrowed funds and certificates of deposit, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, which was partially offset by an increase of $261.0 million in the average balance of lower-costing core deposits during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 to $2,339.1 million from $2,078.1 million for the comparable prior year period.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $167.1 million, an increase of $12.7 million, or 8.20%, from $154.4 million for 2015. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to the growth of net interest-earning assets. These improvements to net interest income were partially offset by a decrease in the net interest spread of eight basis points to 2.86% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from 2.94% for the prior year. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased nine basis points to 3.93% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 4.02% for the year ended December 31, 2015, while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased one basis point to 1.07% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 1.08% for the prior year period. The net interest margin decreased seven basis points to 2.97% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 3.04% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding prepayment penalty income, the net interest margin would have been 2.85% and 2.91% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nProvision (Benefit) for Loan Losses. There was no provision or benefit for loan losses recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to a benefit of $1.0 million recorded during the comparable prior year period. No provision was recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 due to the Company's analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses indicating that the reserve was at an appropriate level. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, non-accrual loans decreased $1.8 million to $21.0 million from $22.8 million at December 31, 2015. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Bank recorded net recoveries totaling $0.7 million, or two basis points of average loans. The current average loan-to-value ratio for our non-performing loans collateralized by real estate was 39.1% at December 31, 2016. When we have obtained properties through foreclosure, we have been able to quickly sell the properties at amounts that approximate book value. The Bank continues to maintain conservative underwriting standards. We anticipate that we will continue to see low loss content in our loan portfolio.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $57.5 million, an increase of $41.8 million, or 266.03%, from $15.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to an increase of $41.5 million in net gains on the sale of buildings, as we sold three of our branch buildings during each of the years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015 in sale-leaseback transactions. Additionally, non-interest income increased due to an increase in net gains from the sale of securities of $1.4 million and a gain from life insurance proceeds of $0.5 million. These increases were partially offset by a $1.6 million increase in net losses from fair value adjustments.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense was $118.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $20.9 million, or 21.37%, from $97.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to increases of $10.4 million in prepayment penalties from the early extinguishment of debt during 2016, $7.7 million in salaries and benefits expense, $1.6 million in other operating expenses, $0.9 million in depreciation and amortization expense and $0.6 million in professional services expense from increases in legal and consulting expenses. The increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to annual salary increases and additions in staffing in retail, audit and compliance departments, as well as increases in production incentives and the cost of split dollar life insurance benefits. The increase in other operating expenses was due to a $1.4 million increase in net losses on the sale of OREO recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the write-down and subsequent sale of one OREO. The growth in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the opening of two new branches along with the move to our new corporate headquarters both occurring during 2015. The efficiency ratio was 59.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to 58.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nTable 146: <table><tr><td>68 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Tax Provisions. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $13.9 million, or 51.30%, to $41.1 million, compared to $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $32.6 million increase in income before income taxes and an increase in the effective tax rate to 38.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from 37.0% in the comparable prior year period. The increase in the effective tax rate reflects the reduced impact that preferential tax items had on the Company's tax liability during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nGeneral. Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was $46.2 million, an increase of $2.0 million, or 4.45%, compared to $44.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. Diluted earnings per common share were $1.59 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $0.11, or 7.43%, from $1.48 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nReturn on average equity increased to 9.93% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, from 9.82% for the prior year. Return on average assets decreased to 0.86% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, from 0.91% for the prior year.\nThe prepayment penalty for the extinguishment of debt totaling $5.2 million, recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014, has been reclassified from interest expense to non-interest expense to conform to the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest Income. Interest income increased $7.0 million, or 3.56%, to $204.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $197.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase of $500.5 million in the average balance of interest-earning assets to $5,084.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $4,583.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was partially offset by a 28 basis point reduction in the yield of interest-earning assets to 4.02% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 4.30% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The 28 basis point decline in the yield of interest-earning assets was primarily due to a 41 basis point reduction in the yield on the loan portfolio to 4.43% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from 4.84% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, combined with a seven basis point decline in the yield on total securities to 2.55% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from 2.62% for the prior year. The 41 basis point decrease in the yield on the loan portfolio was primarily due to a decline in the rates earned on new loan originations and existing loans modified to lower rates. The seven basis point decrease in the yield on the securities portfolio was primarily due to the purchase of new securities at lower yields than the existing portfolio. The yield on the loan portfolio, excluding prepayment penalty income on loans, decreased 40 basis points to 4.27% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from 4.67 % for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $0.2 million, or 0.35%, to $49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase of $450.0 million in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities to $4,586.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $4,136.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was partially offset by a decrease of 12 basis points in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 1.08% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 1.20% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The 12 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily attributable to decreases of 32 basis points and 20 basis points in the cost of certificates of deposit and borrowed funds, respectively. The decrease in the cost of certificates of deposit and borrowed funds was primarily due to maturing issuances being replaced at lower rates. These decreases were partially offset by increases of 20 basis points and 14 basis points in the cost of savings and money market accounts, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from the comparable prior year period. The cost of savings accounts increased as we increased the rate we pay on some of our savings products to attract additional deposits. The cost of money market accounts increased primarily due to our shifting of Government NOW deposits to a money market product which does not require us to provide collateral, allowing us to invest these funds in higher yielding assets. Additionally, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was negatively affected by increases of $151.8 million and $110.6 million in the average balance of higher costing certificates of deposit and borrowed funds, respectively, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, which was partially offset by an increase of $183.2 million in the average balance of lower-costing core deposits during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 to $2,078.1 million from $1,894.9 million for the comparable prior year period.\nTable 147: <table><tr><td>69 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $154.4 million, an increase of $6.8 million, or 4.64%, from $147.6 million for 2014. The increase in net interest income was due to the growth of net interest-earning assets and an increase in prepayment penalty income. These improvements to net interest income were partially offset by a decrease in the net interest spread of 16 basis points to 2.94% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from 3.10% for the prior year. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased 28 basis points to 4.02% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 4.30% for the year ended December 31, 2014, while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 12 basis points to 1.08% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 1.20% for the prior year period. The net interest margin decreased 18 basis points to 3.04% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 3.22% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding prepayment penalty income, the net interest margin would have been 2.91% and 3.09% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nProvision (Benefit) for Loan Losses. The benefit for loan losses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was $1.0 million, a decrease of $5.1 million, or 84.12%, from a benefit of $6.0 million during the comparable prior year period. The benefit recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the continued improvement in both credit conditions and, the qualitative factors used in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, non-accrual loans decreased $9.1 million to $22.8 million from $31.9 million at December 31, 2014. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, net charge-offs totaled $2.6 million, or six basis points of average loans, primarily as a result of two business loans which the Bank deemed unrecoverable. The current average loan-to-value ratio for our non-performing loans collateralized by real estate was 41.4% at December 31, 2015. When we have obtained properties through foreclosure, we have been able to quickly sell the properties at amounts that approximate book value. The Bank continues to maintain conservative underwriting standards. We anticipate that we will continue to see low loss content in our loan portfolio. As a result of the quarterly analysis of the allowance for loans losses, a reduction in the allowance was warranted and, as such, the Company recorded a benefit of $1.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was $15.7 million, an increase of $5.5 million, or 53.46%, from $10.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to an increase of $6.5 million in net gains on the sale of buildings, as we sold and leased back our Brooklyn branch buildings, and increases of $0.4 million in net gains on the sale of loans and $0.3 million in other income. Additionally, non-interest income increased due to a decrease of $0.7 million in net losses from fair value adjustments. These improvements to non-interest income were partially offset by a decrease of $2.7 million in net gains on the sale of securities, primarily due to the comparable prior year period including a net gain on the sale of securities totaling $2.9 million which was comprised of net gains on the sale of securities, as part of a balance sheet deleveraging and net losses on the sale of securities from the sale of substandard trust preferred securities.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense was $97.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $6.7 million, or 7.35%, from $91.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to increases of $4.1 million in salaries and benefits, $3.3 million in other operating expenses and $2.2 million in occupancy and equipment expense. The increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to annual salary increases, increases in staffing in the technology, risk/compliance and retail departments, as well as an increase in restricted stock expense. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to $1.0 million in expenses related to the move of our corporate headquarters, $0.9 million in expenses related to the growth of the Company, $0.7 million in net losses on the sale of OREO and $0.5 million in additional temporary staffing and hiring fees. Other operating expenses also included $0.3 million in ATM fraud losses recorded in 2015. The growth in occupancy and equipment expense was primarily due to increases in rent expense of $1.4 million for our new corporate headquarters and new branch at the same location and $0.6 million from additional space in Manhattan for Business Bankers and a new branch location, which opened in September 2015. Occupancy and equipment expense also included $0.2 million recorded in 2015 for temporary staff for additional security to guard against further ATM fraud losses. Additionally, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the Company also experienced increases of $1.1 million in professional services, primarily due to increased legal and compliance costs and $0.8 million, $0.5 million and $0.3 million in depreciation and amortization expense, FDIC insurance expense and data processing expense, respectively, primarily due to the growth of the Bank. OREO/foreclosure expenses decreased $0.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 due to such period including recoveries of legal fees and a reduction in the level of non-performing loans. These increases were partially offset by the prior year including a $5.2 million prepayment penalty recorded on borrowings as a result of the Bank prepaying $66.9 million in long-term FHLB-NY advances and $30.0 million in repurchase agreements. The efficiency ratio increased to 58.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from 54.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the increased expenses discussed above.\nTable 148: <table><tr><td>70 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Tax Provisions. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $1.4 million, or 4.92%, to $27.2 million, compared to $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the effective tax rate to 37.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from 39.2% in the comparable prior year period, partially offset by an increase of $0.6 million in income before income taxes. The decrease in the effective tax rate reflects the impact of a change in New York City tax law enacted in 2015, which based on the Company's lending mix and certain other factors, reduced our New York City tax liability. Additionally, the decrease in the effective tax rate reflects the greater impact that preferential tax items had on the Company's tax liability during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity, Regulatory Capital and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, principal and interest payments on loans, mortgage-backed and other securities, and proceeds from sales of securities and loans. Deposit flows and mortgage prepayments, however, are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. At December 31, 2016, the Bank was able to borrow up to $2,703.1 million from the FHLB-NY in Federal Home Loan Bank advances and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank had $1,506.4 million outstanding in combined balances of FHLB-NY advances and letters of credit. At December 31, 2015, the Bank also has unsecured lines of credit with other commercial banks totaling $100.0 million. In addition, Flushing Financial Corporation has subordinated debentures totaling $73.4 million and junior subordinated debentures with a face amount of $61.9 million and a carrying amount of $34.0 million (which are both included in Borrowed Funds). (See Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.) Management believes its available sources of funds are sufficient to fund current operations.\nOur most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which include cash and due from banks, overnight interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold with original maturities of 90 days or less. The level of these assets is dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled $35.9 million, a decrease of $6.5 million from December 31, 2015. We also held marketable securities available for sale with a market value of $861.4 million at December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had commitments to extend credit (principally real estate mortgage loans) of $78.1 million and open lines of credit for borrowers (principally business lines of credit and home equity loan lines of credit) of $244.6 million. Since generally all of the loan commitments are expected to be drawn upon, the total loan commitments approximate future cash requirements, whereas the amounts of lines of credit may not be indicative of our future cash requirements. The loan commitments generally expire in 90 days, while construction loan lines of credit mature within 18 months and home equity loan lines of credit mature within 10 years. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments.\nOur total interest expense and operating expense in 2016 were $53.9 million and $118.6 million, respectively.\nWe maintain three postretirement defined benefit plans for our employees: a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan which was frozen as of September 30, 2006, a contributory medical plan, and a noncontributory life insurance plan. The life insurance plan was amended to discontinue providing life insurance benefits to future retirees after January 1, 2010 and the medical plan was frozen as of January 1, 2011. We also maintain a noncontributory defined benefit plan for certain of our non-employee directors, which was frozen as of January 1, 2004. The employee pension plan is the only plan that we have funded. During 2016, we incurred cash expenditures of $0.1 million for the medical and life insurance plans and $0.1 million for the non-employee director plan; we did not make a contribution to the employee pension plan in 2016. We expect to pay similar amounts for these plans in 2016. (See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.)\nThe amounts reported in our financial statements are obtained from reports prepared by independent actuaries, and are based on significant assumptions. The most significant assumption is the discount rate used to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation ( APBO\u201d) for these plans. The APBO is the present value of projected benefits that employees and retirees have earned to date. The discount rate is a single rate at which the liabilities of the plans are discounted into today's dollars and could be effectively settled or eliminated. The discount rate used is based on the Citigroup Pension Liability Index, and reflects a rate that could be earned on bonds over a similar period that we anticipate the plans' liabilities will be paid. An increase in the discount rate would reduce the APBO, while a reduction in the discount rate would increase the APBO. During the past several years, when interest rates have been at historically low levels, the discount rate used for our plans has declined from 7.25% for 2001 to 3.88% for 2016. This decline in the discount rate has resulted in an increase in our APBO.\nTable 149: <table><tr><td>71 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's actuaries use several other assumptions that could have a significant impact on our APBO and periodic expense for these plans. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, expected rate of return on plan assets, future increases in medical and life insurance premiums, turnover rates of employees, and life expectancy. The accounting standards for postretirement plans involve mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility of earnings by allowing changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations to be amortized over time when actual results differ from the assumptions used, there are changes in the assumptions used, or there are plan amendments. At December 31, 2016, our employee pension plan and medical and life insurance plan have unrecognized losses of $8.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The non-employee director plan has a $0.5 million unrecognized gain, due to experience different from what had been estimated and changes in actuarial assumptions. The employee pension plan's unrecognized loss is primarily attributed to the reduction in the discount rate and change in the Plan's mortality table. The medical and life insurance plans' unrecognized loss is attributed to the reduction in the discount rate over the past several years. In addition, the non-employee director pension plan has an unrecognized past service liability of $0.1 million due to plan amendments in prior years and the medical and life insurance plan have a $0.5 million past service credit due to plan amendments. The net after tax effect of the unrecognized gains and losses associated with these plans has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity, resulting in a reduction of stockholders' equity of $4.5 million as of December 31, 2016.\nThe change in the discount rate, the Pension Plan's mortality table and the reduction in medical premiums are the only significant changes made to the assumptions used for these plans for each of three years ended December 31, 2015. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the actual return on the employee pension plan assets was approximately 90%, 31% and 74%, respectively, of the assumed return used to determine the periodic pension expense for that respective year.\nThe market value of the assets of our employee pension plan is $20.5 million at December 31, 2016, which is $2.3 million less than the projected benefit obligation. We do not anticipate a change in the market value of these assets which would have a significant effect on liquidity, capital resources, or results of operations.\nDuring 2016, funds provided by the Company's operating activities amounted to $42.4 million. These funds combined with $273.3 million provided from financing activities and $42.4 million available at the beginning of the period were utilized to fund net investing activities of $322.2 million. The Company's primary business objective is the origination and purchase of multi-family residential loans, commercial business loans and commercial real estate mortgage loans and to a lesser extent one-to-four family (including mixed-use properties) and SBA loans. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the net total of loan originations and purchases less loan repayments and sales was $442.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company also purchased $179.4 million in securities. During 2016, funds were provided by net increases of $312.3 million and $178.5 million in total deposits and short-term borrowed funds and $300.0 million in long-term borrowings. Additionally, funds were provided by $270.8 million in proceeds from maturities, sales, calls and prepayments of securities, $73.4 million from the issuance of subordinated debentures and $49.3 million in proceeds from the sale of buildings. The Company also used funds of $562.4 million, $19.7 million and $9.9 million for the repayment of long-term borrowed funds, dividend payments and purchases of treasury stock, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAt the time of the Bank's conversion from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank, the Bank was required by its primary regulator to establish a liquidation account which is reduced as and to the extent that eligible account holders reduce their qualifying deposits. Upon completion of the Merger, the liquidation account was assumed by the Bank. The balance of the liquidation account at December 31, 2016 was $0.7 million. In the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of the Bank, each eligible account holder will be entitled to receive a distribution from the liquidation account. The Bank is not permitted to declare or pay a dividend or to repurchase any of its capital stock if the effect would be to cause the Bank's regulatory capital to be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account but approval of the NYDFS Superintendent is required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years less prior dividends paid. Flushing Financial Corporation is subject to the same regulatory restrictions on the declaration of dividends as the Bank.\nRegulatory Capital Position. Under applicable regulatory capital regulations, the Bank and the Company are required to comply with each of four separate capital adequacy standards: leverage capital, common equity Tier I risk-based capital, Tier I risk-based capital and total risk-based capital. Such classifications are used by the FDIC and other bank regulatory agencies to determine matters ranging from each institution's quarterly FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments, to approvals of applications authorizing institutions to grow their asset size or otherwise expand business activities. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bank and the Company exceeded each of their four regulatory capital requirements. (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.)\nTable 150: <table><tr><td>72 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's accounting policies are integral to understanding the results of operations and statement of financial condition. These policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Several of these policies require management's judgment to determine the value of the Company's assets and liabilities. The Company has established detailed written policies and control procedures to ensure consistent application of these policies. The Company has identified four accounting policies that require significant management valuation judgment: the allowance for loan losses, fair value of financial instruments, including other-than-temporary impairment assessment, goodwill impairment and income taxes.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. An allowance for loan losses is provided to absorb probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by reviewing all impaired loans on an individual basis. The remaining portfolio is evaluated based on the Company's historical loss experience, recent trends in losses, collection policies and collection experience, trends in the volume of non-performing loans, changes in the composition and volume of the gross loan portfolio, and local and national economic conditions. Judgment is required to determine how many years of historical loss experience are to be included when reviewing historical loss experience. A full credit cycle must be used, or loss estimates may be inaccurate. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available.\nNotwithstanding the judgment required in assessing the components of the allowance for loan losses, the Company believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The policy has been applied on a consistent basis for all periods presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. The Company carries certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value under the fair value option. Fair value is considered the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Management selected the fair value option for certain investment securities, primarily mortgage-backed securities, and certain borrowings. Changes in the fair value of financial instruments for which the fair value election is made are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income. At December 31, 2016, financial assets and financial liabilities with fair values of $30.4 million and $34.0 million, respectively, are carried at fair value under the fair value option.\nThe securities portfolio also consists of mortgage-backed and other securities for which the fair value election was not selected. These securities are classified as available for sale or held-to-maturity. Securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, with changes in fair value recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Securities held-to-maturity are carried at their amortized cost in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. If any decline in fair value for securities classified available for sale or held-to-maturity is deemed other-than-temporary, the security is written down to a new cost basis with the resulting loss recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2016 and 2015, no other-than-temporary impairment charges were recorded.\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities reported at fair value are required to be measured based on the following alternatives: (1) quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments (Level 1), (2) significant other observable inputs (Level 2), or (3) significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). Judgment is required in selecting the appropriate level to be used to determine fair value. The majority of financial assets and financial liabilities for which the fair value election was made, and the majority of investments classified as available for sale and held-to-maturity, were measured using Level 2 inputs, which require judgment to determine the fair value. The trust preferred securities held in the investment portfolio, and the Company's junior subordinated debentures, were measured using Level 3 inputs due to the inactive market for these securities.\nGoodwill Impairment. Goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite life and is tested for impairment, rather than amortized, on at least an annual basis. For the purpose of goodwill impairment testing, management has concluded that the Company has one reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, there is no impairment of goodwill. However, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, further evaluation is required to determine if a write down of goodwill is required.\nTable 151: <table><tr><td>73 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nQuoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are to be used as the basis for measurement, when available. Other acceptable valuation methods include an asset approach, which determines a fair value based upon the value of assets net of liabilities, an income approach, which determines fair value using one or more methods that convert anticipated economic benefits into a present single amount, and a market approach, which determines a fair value based on the similar businesses that have been sold.\nThe Company conducts its annual qualitative impairment testing of goodwill as of December 31. The impairment testing as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 did not show an impairment of goodwill based on the fair value of the Company.\nIncome Taxes. The Company estimates its income taxes payable based on the amounts it expects to owe to the various taxing authorizes (i.e. federal, state and local). In estimating income taxes, management assesses the relative merits and risks of the tax treatment of transactions, taking into account statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the Company's tax position. Management also relies on tax opinions, recent audits, and historical experience.\nThe Company also recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets that the Company estimates are more likely than not to be unrealizable, based on evidence available at the time the estimate is made. These estimates can be affected by changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates, and future income levels.\nContractual Obligations\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due By Period </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3 </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5 </td> <td> </td> <td>Than </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>Years </td> <td> </td> <td>Years </td> <td> </td> <td>5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,266,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>550,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>408,201 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>273,423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,959 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deposits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,205,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,477,852 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>649,794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,274 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan commitments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>322,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>322,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating lease obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,477 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,711 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchase obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,652 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Pension and other postretirement </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>benefits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,063 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,076 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,370 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deferred compensation plans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,034 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,892,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,365,220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,075,911 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>366,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,348 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have significant obligations that arise in the normal course of business. We finance our assets with deposits and borrowings. We also use borrowings to manage our interest-rate risk. Borrowings with call provisions are included in the period of the next call date. We have the means to refinance these borrowings as they mature or are called through financing arrangements with the FHLB-NY and our ability to arrange repurchase agreements with broker-dealers and the FHLB-NY. (See Notes 8 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.)\nWe focus our balance sheet growth on the origination of mortgage loans. At December 31, 2016, we had commitments to extend credit and lines of credit of $322.7 million for mortgage and other loans. These loans will be funded through principal and interest payments received on existing mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, growth in customer deposits, and, when necessary, additional borrowings. (See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.)\nAt December 31, 2016, the Bank had 19 branches, which were all leased. The Bank leases its branch locations primarily when it is not the sole tenant. Whether the Bank will purchase its future branch locations will depend in part on the availability of suitable locations and the availability of properties. In addition, we lease our executive offices. We currently outsource our data processing, loan servicing and check processing functions. We believe that this is the most cost effective method for obtaining these services. These arrangements are usually volume dependent and have varying terms. The contracts for these services usually include annual increases based on the increase in the consumer price index. The amounts shown above for purchase obligations represent the current term and volume of activity of these contracts. We expect to renew these contracts as they expire.\nTable 153: <table><tr><td>74 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe amounts shown for pension and other postretirement benefits reflect our directors' pension plan and the supplemental retirement benefits of our president, and amounts due under our plan for medical and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The amount shown in the Less Than 1 Year\u201d column represents our current estimate for these benefits, some of which are based on information supplied by actuaries. The amounts shown in columns reflecting periods over one year represent our current estimate based on the past year's actual disbursements and information supplied by actuaries. The amounts do not include an increase for possible future retirees or increases in health plan costs. The amount shown in the More Than 5 Years\u201d column represents the amount required to increase the total amount to the projected benefit obligation of the directors' plan and the medical and life insurance benefit plans, since these are unfunded plans and the underfunded portion of the employee pension plan. (See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.)\nWe currently provide a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for officers who have achieved the designated level and completed one year of service. However, certain officers who have not reached the designated level but were already participants remain eligible to participate in the Plan. In addition to the amounts deferred by the officers, we match 50% of their contributions, generally up to a maximum of 5% of the officer's salary. These plans generally require the deferred balance to be credited with earnings at a rate earned by certain mutual funds. Through December 31, 2011, employees could not receive a distribution from these plans until their employment was terminated. The amounts shown in the columns for less than five years represent the estimate of the amounts we will contribute to a rabbi trust with respect to matching contributions under these plans. The amount shown in the More Than 5 Years\u201d column represents the current accrued liability for these plans, adjusted for the activity in the columns for less than five years. This expense is provided in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and the liability has been provided in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAs used in this discussion and analysis, the words we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d and the Company\u201d are used to refer to Flushing Financial Corporation and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, Flushing Bank (the Bank\u201d), Flushing Preferred Funding Corporation, Flushing Service Corporation, and FSB Properties Inc.\nGeneral\nWe are a Delaware corporation organized in May 1994. The Bank was organized in 1929 as a New York State-chartered mutual savings bank. In 1994, the Bank converted to a federally chartered mutual savings bank and changed its name from Flushing Savings Bank to Flushing Savings Bank, FSB. The Bank converted from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank on November 21, 1995, at which time Flushing Financial Corporation acquired all of the stock of the Bank. On February 28, 2013, the Bank's charter was changed to a full-service New York State chartered commercial bank, and its name was changed to Flushing Bank. As a result of the Bank's change in charter to a full-service New York State chartered commercial bank, the Bank's primary regulator became the New York State Department of Financial Services, and its primary federal regulator became the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC\u201d). The Bank's deposits are insured to the maximum allowable amount by the FDIC. The Bank owns three subsidiaries: Flushing Preferred Funding Corporation, Flushing Service Corporation, and FSB Properties Inc.\nFlushing Financial Corporation also owns Flushing Financial Capital Trust II, Flushing Financial Capital Trust III, and Flushing Financial Capital Trust IV (the Trusts\u201d), which are special purpose business trusts formed during 2007 to issue a total of $60.0 million of capital securities, and $1.9 million of common securities (which are the only voting securities). Flushing Financial Corporation owns 100% of the common securities of the Trusts. The Trusts used the proceeds from the issuance of these securities to purchase junior subordinated debentures from Flushing Financial Corporation. The Trusts are not included in our consolidated financial statements as we would not absorb the losses of the Trusts if losses were to occur.\nThe following discussion of financial condition and results of operations includes the collective results of the Flushing Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company\u201d), but reflects principally the Bank's activities. Management views the Company as operating as a single unit - a community bank. Therefore, segment information is not provided.\nThe Bank has a business banking unit which focuses on the development of a full complement of commercial business deposit, loan and cash management products. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the business banking unit had $613.0 million and $525.3 million, respectively, in gross loans outstanding and $144.4 million and $146.3 million, respectively, of customer deposits.\nThe Bank has an internet branch, iGObanking.com\u00ae, which provides access to consumers in markets outside our geographic locations. Accounts can be opened online at www.iGObanking.com or by mail. IGObanking.com\u00ae does not currently accept loan applications. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, iGObanking.com\u00ae had $417.3 million and $323.7 million, respectively, of customer deposits.\nThe Bank has a governmental banking unit, which provides banking services to public entities including counties, cities, towns, villages, school districts, libraries, fire districts and the various courts throughout the New York City metropolitan area. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the government banking unit had $1,062.1 million and $975.9 million, respectively, in customer deposits.\nOverview\nOur principal business is attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those deposits together with funds generated from ongoing operations and borrowings, primarily in (1) originations and purchases of multi-family residential properties, commercial business loans, commercial real estate mortgage loans and, to a lesser extent, one-to-four family (focusing on mixed-use properties, which are properties that contain both residential dwelling units and commercial units); (2) construction loans, primarily for residential properties; (3) Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) loans and other small business loans; (4) mortgage loan surrogates such as mortgage-backed securities; and (5) U.S. government securities, corporate fixed-income securities and other marketable securities. We also originate certain other consumer loans including overdraft lines of credit. Our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on its interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the result of our interest rate margin, which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, adjusted for the difference in the average balance of interest-earning assets as compared to the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. We also generate non-interest income from loan fees, service charges on deposit accounts, mortgage servicing fees, and other fees, income earned on Bank Owned Life Insurance ( BOLI\u201d), dividends on Federal Home Bank of New York ( FHLB-NY\u201d) stock and net gains and losses on sales of securities and loans. Our operating expenses consist principally of employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, other general and administrative expenses and income tax expense. Our results of operations also can be significantly affected by our periodic provision for loan losses and specific provision for losses on real estate owned.\n 58 \nManagement Strategy. Our strategy is to continue our focus on being an institution serving consumers, businesses, and governmental units in our local markets. In furtherance of this objective, we intend to:\n \u00b7 Increase core deposits and continue to improve funding mix; \n \u00b7 increase net interest income by leveraging loan pricing opportunities; \n \u00b7 enhance earnings by managing net interest margin and improving scalability and efficiency; \n \u00b7 manage credit risk; \n \u00b7 maintain well capitalized levels under all stress test scenarios; \n \u00b7 increase our commitment to the multi-cultural marketplace, with a particular focus on the Asian community in Queens; \n \u00b7 manage enterprise-wide risk. \nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively implement this strategy. Our strategy is subject to change by the Board of Directors.\nIncrease core deposits and continue to improve funding mix. We have a relatively stable retail deposit base drawn from our market area through our full-service offices. Although we seek to retain existing deposits and maintain depositor relationships by offering quality service and competitive interest rates to our customers, we also seek to keep deposit growth within reasonable limits and our strategic plan. In order to implement our strategic plan, we have built multi-channel deposit gathering capabilities. The business banking operation was designed specifically to develop full business relationships thereby bringing in lower-costing checking and money market deposits. At December 31, 2016, deposits balances in the business sector are $144.4 million. We also have iGObanking.com\u00ae\u201d, as a division of the Bank, to compete for deposits from sources outside the geographic footprint of our full-service offices. In creating iGObanking.com\u00ae, our strategy is to reduce our reliance on wholesale borrowings and reduce our funding costs. Deposit balances in iGObanking.com\u00ae were $417.3 million at December 31, 2016, at rates lower than our borrowings. We have a government banking division as an additional source of deposits. At December 31, 2016, deposits in our government banking division totaled $1,062.1 million at rates below our average cost of funds. We also obtain deposits through brokers and the CDARS\u00ae and ICS network. Management intends to balance its goal to maintain competitive interest rates on deposits while seeking to manage its overall cost of funds to finance its strategies. We generally rely on our deposit base as our principal source of funding. During 2016, we realized an increase in due to depositors of $309.7 million, as core deposits increased $340.9 million while certificates of deposit decreased $31.2 million.\nA significant portion of our lending and deposit customers do not have both their loans and deposits with us. We intend to continue to focus on obtaining additional deposits from our lending customers and originating additional loans to our deposit customers. Product offerings were expanded and are expected to be further expanded to accommodate perceived customer demands. In addition, specific employees are assigned responsibilities of generating these additional deposits and loans by coordinating efforts between lending and deposit gathering departments.\n 59 \nIncrease net interest income by leveraging loan pricing opportunities. During 2016, we repositioned our strategy to focus more on loan pricing as opposed to volume. We saw yields on originations increase for the third and fourth quarters of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The average interest rate obtained for third quarter 2016 originations was 3.74% as compared to 3.56% for the 2015 period. For fourth quarter 2016 originations, the average interest rate increased 13 basis points to 3.81% as compared to 3.68% for the 2015 period.\nWe have emphasized the strategic growth of multi-family residential mortgage loans and floating rate commercial business loans. We have re-entered the higher-yielding non-owner occupied commercial real estate lending during 2015. We continued to deemphasize one-to-four family - mixed-use property and construction lending and we no longer provide taxi medallion loans.\nThe following table shows loan originations and purchases during 2016, and loan balances as of December 31, 2016.\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Loan </td> <td> </td> <td>Loan Balances </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Originations and </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Purchases </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross Loans </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Multi-family residential </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>371,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,178,504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>322,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,246,132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.86 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>One-to-four family - mixed-use property </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>558,502 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.59 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>One-to-four family - residential </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>185,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.85 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Co-operative apartment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,772 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Small Business Administration </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Taxi Medallion </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.39 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial Business and Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>326,776 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>597,122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.39 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,132,938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,819,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2016, multi-family residential, commercial business and other loans and commercial real estate loans, totaled 83.5% of our gross loans. We have repositioned our loan growth since the Great Recession to reduce credit risk; however, our concentration in these types of loans could require us to increase our provisions for loan losses and to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance currently maintained.\nEnhance earnings by managing net interest margin and improving scalability and efficiency. By taking advantage of loan pricing opportunities and continuing to maintain a lower cost of funds, we actively manage the net interest margin. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased one basis point to 1.07% from 1.08% for the year ended December 31, 2015. During 2017, approximately 47% of our borrowings and certificates of deposits are scheduled to mature or reprice. During 2016, we renovated two branches to the Universal Banker model and plan to renovate three branches during 2017. The Universal Banker model will result in savings of both personnel and occupancy costs while providing our customers with cutting-edge technology.\nManage credit risk. By adherence to our conservative underwriting standards, we have been able to minimize net losses from impaired loans, recording net recoveries of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net charge-offs of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The loan to value for the real estate dependent loan portfolio was 40.5% and the average loan to value for non-performing loans collateralized by real estate was 39.1% at December 31, 2016. We seek to maintain our loans in performing status through, among other things, disciplined collection efforts, and consistently monitoring non-performing assets in an effort to return them to performing status. To this end, we review the quality of our loans and report to the Loan Committee of the Board of Directors of the Bank on a monthly basis. We sold 26 delinquent loans totaling $8.0 million, 23 delinquent loans totaling $9.0 million, and 34 delinquent loans totaling $15.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We recorded net recoveries on delinquent loans that were sold during 2016, 2015 and 2014 of $48,000, $0.1 million and $0.4 million. We realized gross gains of $0.3 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million on the sale of delinquent loans for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We realized gross losses of $2,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. We did not record any gross losses during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2014. There can be no assurances that we will continue this strategy in future periods, or if continued, we will be able to find buyers to pay adequate consideration. Non-performing loans totaled $21.9 million and $31.0 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.36% and 0.54% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n 60 \nMaintain well capitalized levels under all stress test scenarios. The Bank faces several minimum capital requirements imposed by federal regulation. Failure to adhere to these minimums could limit the dividends the Bank is allowed to pay, including the payment of dividends to Flushing Financial Corporation, and could limit the annual growth of the Bank. Under the Dodd Frank Act, banks with assets greater than $10.0 billion in total assets are required to complete stress tests, which predict capital levels under certain stress levels. Although, our total assets are currently $6.1 billion, as a best practice, we completed these tests. As of December 31, 2016, under all stress scenarios, we remain well capitalized per current regulations.\nIncrease Our Commitment to the Multi-Cultural Marketplace, with a Particular Focus on the Asian Community in Queens. Our branches are all located in the New York City metropolitan area with particular concentration in the borough of Queens. Queens is characterized with a high level of ethnic diversity. An important element of our strategy is to service multi-ethnic consumers and businesses. We have a particular presence and concentration in Asian communities, including in particular the Chinese and Korean populations. Both groups are noted for high levels of savings, education and entrepreneurship. In order to service these and other important ethnic groups in our market, our staff speaks more than 30 languages. We have an Asian advisory board to help broaden our links to the community by providing guidance and fostering awareness of our active role in the local community. Through our focus on and commitment to the Asian community in Queens, where we have four branches, we have obtained approximately $500 million in deposits in these branches. We also have over $450 million of loans and lines of credit outstanding to borrowers in the Asian community.\nManage Enterprise-Wide Risk. We identify, measure and attempt to mitigate risks that affect, or have the potential to affect, our business. Due to past economic crises and recent increases in government regulation, we devote significant resources to risk management. We have a seasoned risk officer to provide executive risk leadership, and an enterprise-wide risk management program. Several enterprise risk management analytical products are in use which include key risk indicators. We also have had a chief information security officer even before one will be required by recent NYDFS rulemaking not yet in effect. Our management of enterprise-wide risk enables us to recognize and monitor risks and establish procedures to disseminate the risk information across our organization and to our Board of Directors. The objective is to have a robust and focused risk management process capable of identifying and mitigating emerging threats to the Bank's safety and soundness.\nTrends and Contingencies. Our operating results are significantly affected by national and local economic and competitive conditions, including changes in market interest rates, the strength of the local economy, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. We have remained strategically focused on the origination of multi-family residential mortgages and to a lesser extent, commercial real estate and one-to-four family mixed-use property mortgage loans. However, in late 2014 and throughout 2015 and 2016 we have increased our emphasis on the origination and purchase of business loans with full banking relationships and commercial real estate loans. As a result of this strategy, we were able to continue to achieve a higher yield on our mortgage portfolio than we would have otherwise experienced.\nAs we have seen improvements in the local economy, our non-performing loans have decreased. The majority of our impaired loans are income producing residential properties located in the New York City metropolitan market. Due to the low vacancy rates for these types of properties, they have retained more of their value, thereby reducing their loss content. Non-performing loans totaled $21.4 million, $26.1 million and $34.2 million at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We have not experienced a significant increase in foreclosed properties despite an extended foreclosure process in our market. The extended foreclosure process in our market is due to the high number of foreclosure actions filed in the court system in the counties for which we are seeking foreclosure on delinquent mortgage loans. We have not encountered significant issues with documentation relating to mortgages for which we are seeking foreclosure as we maintain custody of all loan documents and review them prior to providing them to our legal counsel to initiate the foreclosure action. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded net recoveries of $0.7 million compared to net charge-offs of $2.6 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This improvement in net charge-offs allowed us to not record a provision for loan losses during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to benefits of $1.0 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We cannot predict the effect of these economic conditions on the Company's future financial condition or operating results.\n 61 \nLoan originations and purchases were $1,132.9 million, $1,233.5 million and $958.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. While we primarily rely on originating our own loans, we purchased $186.7 million, $278.9 million and $169.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We purchase loans when the loans complement our loan portfolio strategy. Loans purchased must meet our underwriting standards when they were originated.\nDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, the allocation of our loan portfolio has remained fairly consistent. The majority of our loans are collateralized by real estate, which comprised 86.9% of our portfolio at December 31, 2016 compared to 87.7% at December 31, 2015 and 87.4% at December 31, 2014. Multi-family residential mortgage loans comprised 45.2%, 47.0% and 50.6% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Commercial real estate mortgage loans comprised 25.9%, 22.9% and 16.4% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. One-to-four family mixed-use property mortgage loans comprised 11.6%, 13.1% and 15.1% of loan portfolio at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. One-to-four family residential mortgage loans comprised 3.9%, 4.3% and 4.9% of loan portfolio at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDue to depositors increased $309.7 million, $382.8 million and $272.9 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Lower-costing core deposits increased $340.9 million, $285.3 million and $88.1 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Higher-costing certificates of deposit decreased $31.2 million during 2016 compared to increases $97.5 million during 2015 and $184.9 million during 2014. Brokered deposits represented 26.5%, 25.2% and 21.8% of total deposits at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nPrevailing interest rates affect the extent to which borrowers repay and refinance loans. In a declining interest rate environment, the number of loan prepayments and loan refinancing tends to increase, as do prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. Call provisions associated with our investments in U.S. government agency and corporate securities may also adversely affect yield in a declining interest rate environment. Such prepayments and calls may adversely affect the yield of our loan portfolio and mortgage-backed and other securities as we reinvest the prepaid funds in a lower interest rate environment. However, we typically receive additional loan fees when existing loans are refinanced, which partially offsets the reduced yield on our loan portfolio resulting from prepayments. In periods of low interest rates, our level of core deposits also may decline if depositors seek higher-yielding instruments or other investments not offered by us, which in turn may increase our cost of funds and decrease our net interest margin to the extent alternative funding sources, are utilized. By contrast, an increasing interest rate environment would tend to extend the average lives of lower yielding fixed rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, which could adversely affect net interest income. In addition, depositors tend to open longer term, higher costing certificate of deposit accounts which could adversely affect our net interest income if rates were to subsequently decline. Additionally, adjustable rate residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities generally contain interim and lifetime caps that limit the amount the interest rate can increase at re-pricing dates.\nWe attempt to pursue the guarantor on all loans for which a loss has been incurred and for which a guarantee was obtained, when, after considering the benefits and costs, we have concluded we will be successful in recovering at least a portion of the loss we incurred. The success of this pursuit is based on the assets the guarantor holds when we obtain a judgment.\nDuring 2016, we sought performance under guarantees on three business loans, seeking judgment of approximately $3.6 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had received $6,000 on these business loans. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we realized recoveries of approximately $50,000 on business loans for which we sought judgments prior to 2016. During 2015, we sought performance under guarantees on two business loans, seeking judgment of approximately $2.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we realized recoveries of approximately $0.3 million on business loans and $0.1 million on real estate mortgage loans for which we sought judgments prior to 2015.\n 62 \nDuring 2016 our net interest income increased $12.7 million, or 8.20%, to $167.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from $154.4 million for the comparable prior year period, as a seven basis point decrease in the net interest margin to 2.97% for the twelve month ended December 31, 2016 was more than offset by balance sheet growth. The decrease in the net interest margin for 2016 was primarily due to a decline in the yield of our interest-earning assets, partially offset by a reduction in our funding costs. The decline in the yield of our interest earning assets was primarily due to rates earned on new loans originated and securities purchased during 2016 being lower than the yield of the existing portfolio. During 2016, the average balance of total loans, net increased $567.2 million to $4,600.7 million. During 2016, the average balance of borrowed funds increased by $126.6 million to $1,231.0 million compared to $1,104.4 million for 2015, while the cost of borrowed funds decreased nine basis points to 1.67% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 1.76% in the comparable period. The cost of certificates of deposit accounts decreased nine basis points for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from the prior year, while the cost of money market accounts, NOW and savings accounts increased 21 basis points, seven basis points and four basis points, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from the prior year. The cost of money market accounts increased primarily due to our shifting of Government NOW deposits to an Insured Cash Sweep service ( ICS\u201d) brokered money market product, which does not require us to provide collateral. This allows us to invest our funds in higher yielding assets. The cost of savings and NOW accounts increased as we increased the rates we pay on certain accounts to attract additional deposits. This resulted in an increase in the cost of due to depositors of one basis point to 0.89% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from 0.88% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Overall, as a result of these changes to our funding mix we were able to reduce our cost of interest-bearing liabilities one basis point to 1.07% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 1.08% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe are unable to predict the direction or timing of future interest rate changes. Approximately 47% of our certificates of deposit accounts and borrowings reprice or mature during the next year, which could result in a decrease in the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Also, in a decreasing interest rate environment, mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities with higher rates tend to prepay, which could result in a reduction in the yield on our interest-earning assets.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity Analysis\nA financial institution's exposure to the risks of changing interest rates may be analyzed, in part, by examining the extent to which its assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive\u201d and by monitoring the institution's interest rate sensitivity gap.\u201d An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period. Accordingly, a positive gap may enhance net interest income in a rising rate environment and reduce net interest income in a falling rate environment. Conversely, a negative gap may enhance net interest income in a falling rate environment and reduce net interest income in a rising rate environment.\nThe table below sets forth the amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding at December 31, 2016 which are anticipated by the Company, based upon certain assumptions, to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except as stated below, the amount of assets and liabilities shown that reprice or mature during a particular period was determined in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability. Prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities are based on our experience and industry averages, which generally range from 6% to 36%, depending on the contractual rate of interest and the underlying collateral. Money market accounts and savings accounts were assumed to have a withdrawal or run-off\u201d rate of 14% and 23%, respectively, based on our experience. While management bases these assumptions on actual prepayments and withdrawals experienced by us, there is no guarantee that these trends will continue in the future.\n 63 \nTable 132: <table> <tr>

31, 2016.\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar estimated maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in differing degrees to changes in market interest rates and may bear rates that differ in varying degrees from the rates that would apply upon maturity and reinvestment or upon repricing. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as ARM loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a significant change in the level of interest rates, prepayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities, and deposit withdrawal or run-off\u201d levels, would likely deviate materially from those assumed in calculating the above table. In the event of an interest rate increase, some borrowers may be unable to meet the increased payments on their adjustable-rate debt. The interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes that the nature of the Company's assets and liabilities remains static. Interest rates may have an effect on customer preferences for deposits and loan products. Finally, the maturity and repricing characteristics of many assets and liabilities as set forth in the above table are not governed by contract but rather by management's best judgment based on current market conditions and anticipated business strategies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in fair value of certain investments due to changes in interest rates. Generally, the fair value of financial investments such as loans and securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. As a result, increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the fair value of our interest-earning assets which could adversely affect our results of operations if such assets were sold, or, in the case of securities classified as available for sale, decreases in our stockholders' equity if such securities were retained.\n 64 \nWe manage the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities on a continuous basis to maximize return and adjust our exposure to interest rate risk. On a quarterly basis, management prepares the Earnings and Economic Exposure to Changes in Interest Rate\u201d report for review by the Board of Directors, as summarized below. This report quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and net portfolio value should interest rates go up or down (shocked) 200 basis points, assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other. Net portfolio value is defined as the market value of assets net of the market value of liabilities. The market value of assets and liabilities is determined using a discounted cash flow calculation. The net portfolio value ratio is the ratio of the net portfolio value to the market value of assets. All changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and net portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario. The base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at December 31, 2015. Various estimates regarding prepayment assumptions are made at each level of rate shock. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. At December 31, 2016, we were within the guidelines established by the Board of Directors for each interest rate level.\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Projected Percentage Change In </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Portfolio </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in Interest Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Interest Income </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Portfolio Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Value Ratio </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>-200 basis points </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.74 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-1.87 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.79 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.76 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.05 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>-100 basis points </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.03 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Base interest rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.57 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>+100 basis points </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-6.38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-4.96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-11.56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-11.34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.57 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>+200 basis points </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-13.97 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-10.45 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-26.43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-26.30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnalysis of Net Interest Income\nNet interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends upon the relative amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them.\nThe following table sets forth certain information relating to our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. Average balances are derived from average daily balances. The yields include amortization of fees that are considered adjustments to yields.\n 65 \nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td>

Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $64.9 million, an increase of $18.7 million, or 40.48%, compared to $46.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Diluted earnings per common share were $2.24 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $0.65, or 40.88%, from $1.59 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nReturn on average equity increased to 13.07% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, from 9.93% for the prior year. Return on average assets increased to 1.10% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, from 0.86% for the prior year.\nInterest Income. Interest income increased $16.9 million, or 8.25%, to $221.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $204.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase of $542.6 million in the average balance of interest-earning assets to $5,626.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $5,084.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was partially offset by a nine basis point reduction in the yield of interest-earning assets to 3.93% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 4.02% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The nine basis point decline in the yield of interest-earning assets was primarily due to a 19 basis point reduction in the yield on the loan portfolio to 4.24% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from 4.43% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by a 10 basis point increase in the yield on total securities to 2.65% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from 2.55% for the prior year. The 19 basis point decrease in the yield on the loan portfolio was primarily due to a decline in the rates earned on new loan originations and existing loans modified to lower rates. The 10 basis point increase in the yield on the securities portfolio was primarily due to the purchase of new securities at higher yields than the existing portfolio. The yield on the loan portfolio, excluding prepayment penalty income on loans, decreased 17 basis points to 4.10% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from 4.27 % for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\n 67 \nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $4.2 million, or 8.42%, to $53.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase of $449.5 million in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities to $5,036.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $4,586.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was partially offset by a decrease of one basis point in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 1.07% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 1.08% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The one basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily attributable to decreases of nine basis points in each of the cost of certificates of deposit and borrowed funds. The decrease in the cost of certificates of deposit and borrowed funds was primarily due to maturing issuances being replaced at lower rates. Additionally, the cost of borrowed funds benefited from the early extinguishment of $130.0 million in FHLB-NY advances at an average cost of 2.82% and $78.0 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase, at an average cost of 3.80% during 2016. These decreases were partially offset by increases of 21 basis points, seven basis points and four basis points in the cost of money market, NOW and savings accounts, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from the comparable prior year period. The cost of money market accounts increased primarily due to our shifting of Government NOW deposits to a money market product which does not require us to provide collateral, allowing us to invest these funds in higher yielding assets. The cost of NOW and savings accounts increased as we increased the rate we pay on some of our products to attract additional deposits. Additionally, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was negatively affected by increases of $126.6 million and $58.2 million in the average balance of higher costing borrowed funds and certificates of deposit, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, which was partially offset by an increase of $261.0 million in the average balance of lower-costing core deposits during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 to $2,339.1 million from $2,078.1 million for the comparable prior year period.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $167.1 million, an increase of $12.7 million, or 8.20%, from $154.4 million for 2015. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to the growth of net interest-earning assets. These improvements to net interest income were partially offset by a decrease in the net interest spread of eight basis points to 2.86% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from 2.94% for the prior year. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased nine basis points to 3.93% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 4.02% for the year ended December 31, 2015, while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased one basis point to 1.07% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 1.08% for the prior year period. The net interest margin decreased seven basis points to 2.97% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 3.04% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding prepayment penalty income, the net interest margin would have been 2.85% and 2.91% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nProvision (Benefit) for Loan Losses. There was no provision or benefit for loan losses recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to a benefit of $1.0 million recorded during the comparable prior year period. No provision was recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 due to the Company's analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses indicating that the reserve was at an appropriate level. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, non-accrual loans decreased $1.8 million to $21.0 million from $22.8 million at December 31, 2015. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Bank recorded net recoveries totaling $0.7 million, or two basis points of average loans. The current average loan-to-value ratio for our non-performing loans collateralized by real estate was 39.1% at December 31, 2016. When we have obtained properties through foreclosure, we have been able to quickly sell the properties at amounts that approximate book value. The Bank continues to maintain conservative underwriting standards. We anticipate that we will continue to see low loss content in our loan portfolio.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $57.5 million, an increase of $41.8 million, or 266.03%, from $15.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to an increase of $41.5 million in net gains on the sale of buildings, as we sold three of our branch buildings during each of the years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015 in sale-leaseback transactions. Additionally, non-interest income increased due to an increase in net gains from the sale of securities of $1.4 million and a gain from life insurance proceeds of $0.5 million. These increases were partially offset by a $1.6 million increase in net losses from fair value adjustments.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense was $118.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $20.9 million, or 21.37%, from $97.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to increases of $10.4 million in prepayment penalties from the early extinguishment of debt during 2016, $7.7 million in salaries and benefits expense, $1.6 million in other operating expenses, $0.9 million in depreciation and amortization expense and $0.6 million in professional services expense from increases in legal and consulting expenses. The increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to annual salary increases and additions in staffing in retail, audit and compliance departments, as well as increases in production incentives and the cost of split dollar life insurance benefits. The increase in other operating expenses was due to a $1.4 million increase in net losses on the sale of OREO recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the write-down and subsequent sale of one OREO. The growth in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the opening of two new branches along with the move to our new corporate headquarters both occurring during 2015. The efficiency ratio was 59.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to 58.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\n 68 \nIncome Tax Provisions. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $13.9 million, or 51.30%, to $41.1 million, compared to $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $32.6 million increase in income before income taxes and an increase in the effective tax rate to 38.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from 37.0% in the comparable prior year period. The increase in the effective tax rate reflects the reduced impact that preferential tax items had on the Company's tax liability during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nGeneral. Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was $46.2 million, an increase of $2.0 million, or 4.45%, compared to $44.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. Diluted earnings per common share were $1.59 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $0.11, or 7.43%, from $1.48 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nReturn on average equity increased to 9.93% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, from 9.82% for the prior year. Return on average assets decreased to 0.86% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, from 0.91% for the prior year.\nThe prepayment penalty for the extinguishment of debt totaling $5.2 million, recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014, has been reclassified from interest expense to non-interest expense to conform to the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest Income. Interest income increased $7.0 million, or 3.56%, to $204.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $197.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase of $500.5 million in the average balance of interest-earning assets to $5,084.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $4,583.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was partially offset by a 28 basis point reduction in the yield of interest-earning assets to 4.02% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 4.30% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The 28 basis point decline in the yield of interest-earning assets was primarily due to a 41 basis point reduction in the yield on the loan portfolio to 4.43% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from 4.84% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, combined with a seven basis point decline in the yield on total securities to 2.55% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from 2.62% for the prior year. The 41 basis point decrease in the yield on the loan portfolio was primarily due to a decline in the rates earned on new loan originations and existing loans modified to lower rates. The seven basis point decrease in the yield on the securities portfolio was primarily due to the purchase of new securities at lower yields than the existing portfolio. The yield on the loan portfolio, excluding prepayment penalty income on loans, decreased 40 basis points to 4.27% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from 4.67 % for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $0.2 million, or 0.35%, to $49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase of $450.0 million in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities to $4,586.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $4,136.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was partially offset by a decrease of 12 basis points in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 1.08% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 1.20% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The 12 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily attributable to decreases of 32 basis points and 20 basis points in the cost of certificates of deposit and borrowed funds, respectively. The decrease in the cost of certificates of deposit and borrowed funds was primarily due to maturing issuances being replaced at lower rates. These decreases were partially offset by increases of 20 basis points and 14 basis points in the cost of savings and money market accounts, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from the comparable prior year period. The cost of savings accounts increased as we increased the rate we pay on some of our savings products to attract additional deposits. The cost of money market accounts increased primarily due to our shifting of Government NOW deposits to a money market product which does not require us to provide collateral, allowing us to invest these funds in higher yielding assets. Additionally, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was negatively affected by increases of $151.8 million and $110.6 million in the average balance of higher costing certificates of deposit and borrowed funds, respectively, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, which was partially offset by an increase of $183.2 million in the average balance of lower-costing core deposits during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 to $2,078.1 million from $1,894.9 million for the comparable prior year period.\n 69 \nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $154.4 million, an increase of $6.8 million, or 4.64%, from $147.6 million for 2014. The increase in net interest income was due to the growth of net interest-earning assets and an increase in prepayment penalty income. These improvements to net interest income were partially offset by a decrease in the net interest spread of 16 basis points to 2.94% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from 3.10% for the prior year. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased 28 basis points to 4.02% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 4.30% for the year ended December 31, 2014, while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 12 basis points to 1.08% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 1.20% for the prior year period. The net interest margin decreased 18 basis points to 3.04% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 3.22% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding prepayment penalty income, the net interest margin would have been 2.91% and 3.09% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nProvision (Benefit) for Loan Losses. The benefit for loan losses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was $1.0 million, a decrease of $5.1 million, or 84.12%, from a benefit of $6.0 million during the comparable prior year period. The benefit recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the continued improvement in both credit conditions and, the qualitative factors used in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, non-accrual loans decreased $9.1 million to $22.8 million from $31.9 million at December 31, 2014. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, net charge-offs totaled $2.6 million, or six basis points of average loans, primarily as a result of two business loans which the Bank deemed unrecoverable. The current average loan-to-value ratio for our non-performing loans collateralized by real estate was 41.4% at December 31, 2015. When we have obtained properties through foreclosure, we have been able to quickly sell the properties at amounts that approximate book value. The Bank continues to maintain conservative underwriting standards. We anticipate that we will continue to see low loss content in our loan portfolio. As a result of the quarterly analysis of the allowance for loans losses, a reduction in the allowance was warranted and, as such, the Company recorded a benefit of $1.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was $15.7 million, an increase of $5.5 million, or 53.46%, from $10.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to an increase of $6.5 million in net gains on the sale of buildings, as we sold and leased back our Brooklyn branch buildings, and increases of $0.4 million in net gains on the sale of loans and $0.3 million in other income. Additionally, non-interest income increased due to a decrease of $0.7 million in net losses from fair value adjustments. These improvements to non-interest income were partially offset by a decrease of $2.7 million in net gains on the sale of securities, primarily due to the comparable prior year period including a net gain on the sale of securities totaling $2.9 million which was comprised of net gains on the sale of securities, as part of a balance sheet deleveraging and net losses on the sale of securities from the sale of substandard trust preferred securities.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense was $97.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $6.7 million, or 7.35%, from $91.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to increases of $4.1 million in salaries and benefits, $3.3 million in other operating expenses and $2.2 million in occupancy and equipment expense. The increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to annual salary increases, increases in staffing in the technology, risk/compliance and retail departments, as well as an increase in restricted stock expense. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to $1.0 million in expenses related to the move of our corporate headquarters, $0.9 million in expenses related to the growth of the Company, $0.7 million in net losses on the sale of OREO and $0.5 million in additional temporary staffing and hiring fees. Other operating expenses also included $0.3 million in ATM fraud losses recorded in 2015. The growth in occupancy and equipment expense was primarily due to increases in rent expense of $1.4 million for our new corporate headquarters and new branch at the same location and $0.6 million from additional space in Manhattan for Business Bankers and a new branch location, which opened in September 2015. Occupancy and equipment expense also included $0.2 million recorded in 2015 for temporary staff for additional security to guard against further ATM fraud losses. Additionally, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the Company also experienced increases of $1.1 million in professional services, primarily due to increased legal and compliance costs and $0.8 million, $0.5 million and $0.3 million in depreciation and amortization expense, FDIC insurance expense and data processing expense, respectively, primarily due to the growth of the Bank. OREO/foreclosure expenses decreased $0.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 due to such period including recoveries of legal fees and a reduction in the level of non-performing loans. These increases were partially offset by the prior year including a $5.2 million prepayment penalty recorded on borrowings as a result of the Bank prepaying $66.9 million in long-term FHLB-NY advances and $30.0 million in repurchase agreements. The efficiency ratio increased to 58.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from 54.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the increased expenses discussed above.\n 70 \nIncome Tax Provisions. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $1.4 million, or 4.92%, to $27.2 million, compared to $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the effective tax rate to 37.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from 39.2% in the comparable prior year period, partially offset by an increase of $0.6 million in income before income taxes. The decrease in the effective tax rate reflects the impact of a change in New York City tax law enacted in 2015, which based on the Company's lending mix and certain other factors, reduced our New York City tax liability. Additionally, the decrease in the effective tax rate reflects the greater impact that preferential tax items had on the Company's tax liability during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity, Regulatory Capital and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, principal and interest payments on loans, mortgage-backed and other securities, and proceeds from sales of securities and loans. Deposit flows and mortgage prepayments, however, are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. At December 31, 2016, the Bank was able to borrow up to $2,703.1 million from the FHLB-NY in Federal Home Loan Bank advances and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank had $1,506.4 million outstanding in combined balances of FHLB-NY advances and letters of credit. At December 31, 2015, the Bank also has unsecured lines of credit with other commercial banks totaling $100.0 million. In addition, Flushing Financial Corporation has subordinated debentures totaling $73.4 million and junior subordinated debentures with a face amount of $61.9 million and a carrying amount of $34.0 million (which are both included in Borrowed Funds). (See Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.) Management believes its available sources of funds are sufficient to fund current operations.\nOur most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which include cash and due from banks, overnight interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold with original maturities of 90 days or less. The level of these assets is dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled $35.9 million, a decrease of $6.5 million from December 31, 2015. We also held marketable securities available for sale with a market value of $861.4 million at December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had commitments to extend credit (principally real estate mortgage loans) of $78.1 million and open lines of credit for borrowers (principally business lines of credit and home equity loan lines of credit) of $244.6 million. Since generally all of the loan commitments are expected to be drawn upon, the total loan commitments approximate future cash requirements, whereas the amounts of lines of credit may not be indicative of our future cash requirements. The loan commitments generally expire in 90 days, while construction loan lines of credit mature within 18 months and home equity loan lines of credit mature within 10 years. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments.\nOur total interest expense and operating expense in 2016 were $53.9 million and $118.6 million, respectively.\nWe maintain three postretirement defined benefit plans for our employees: a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan which was frozen as of September 30, 2006, a contributory medical plan, and a noncontributory life insurance plan. The life insurance plan was amended to discontinue providing life insurance benefits to future retirees after January 1, 2010 and the medical plan was frozen as of January 1, 2011. We also maintain a noncontributory defined benefit plan for certain of our non-employee directors, which was frozen as of January 1, 2004. The employee pension plan is the only plan that we have funded. During 2016, we incurred cash expenditures of $0.1 million for the medical and life insurance plans and $0.1 million for the non-employee director plan; we did not make a contribution to the employee pension plan in 2016. We expect to pay similar amounts for these plans in 2016. (See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.)\nThe amounts reported in our financial statements are obtained from reports prepared by independent actuaries, and are based on significant assumptions. The most significant assumption is the discount rate used to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation ( APBO\u201d) for these plans. The APBO is the present value of projected benefits that employees and retirees have earned to date. The discount rate is a single rate at which the liabilities of the plans are discounted into today's dollars and could be effectively settled or eliminated. The discount rate used is based on the Citigroup Pension Liability Index, and reflects a rate that could be earned on bonds over a similar period that we anticipate the plans' liabilities will be paid. An increase in the discount rate would reduce the APBO, while a reduction in the discount rate would increase the APBO. During the past several years, when interest rates have been at historically low levels, the discount rate used for our plans has declined from 7.25% for 2001 to 3.88% for 2016. This decline in the discount rate has resulted in an increase in our APBO.\n 71 \nThe Company's actuaries use several other assumptions that could have a significant impact on our APBO and periodic expense for these plans. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, expected rate of return on plan assets, future increases in medical and life insurance premiums, turnover rates of employees, and life expectancy. The accounting standards for postretirement plans involve mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility of earnings by allowing changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations to be amortized over time when actual results differ from the assumptions used, there are changes in the assumptions used, or there are plan amendments. At December 31, 2016, our employee pension plan and medical and life insurance plan have unrecognized losses of $8.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The non-employee director plan has a $0.5 million unrecognized gain, due to experience different from what had been estimated and changes in actuarial assumptions. The employee pension plan's unrecognized loss is primarily attributed to the reduction in the discount rate and change in the Plan's mortality table. The medical and life insurance plans' unrecognized loss is attributed to the reduction in the discount rate over the past several years. In addition, the non-employee director pension plan has an unrecognized past service liability of $0.1 million due to plan amendments in prior years and the medical and life insurance plan have a $0.5 million past service credit due to plan amendments. The net after tax effect of the unrecognized gains and losses associated with these plans has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity, resulting in a reduction of stockholders' equity of $4.5 million as of December 31, 2016.\nThe change in the discount rate, the Pension Plan's mortality table and the reduction in medical premiums are the only significant changes made to the assumptions used for these plans for each of three years ended December 31, 2015. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the actual return on the employee pension plan assets was approximately 90%, 31% and 74%, respectively, of the assumed return used to determine the periodic pension expense for that respective year.\nThe market value of the assets of our employee pension plan is $20.5 million at December 31, 2016, which is $2.3 million less than the projected benefit obligation. We do not anticipate a change in the market value of these assets which would have a significant effect on liquidity, capital resources, or results of operations.\nDuring 2016, funds provided by the Company's operating activities amounted to $42.4 million. These funds combined with $273.3 million provided from financing activities and $42.4 million available at the beginning of the period were utilized to fund net investing activities of $322.2 million. The Company's primary business objective is the origination and purchase of multi-family residential loans, commercial business loans and commercial real estate mortgage loans and to a lesser extent one-to-four family (including mixed-use properties) and SBA loans. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the net total of loan originations and purchases less loan repayments and sales was $442.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company also purchased $179.4 million in securities. During 2016, funds were provided by net increases of $312.3 million and $178.5 million in total deposits and short-term borrowed funds and $300.0 million in long-term borrowings. Additionally, funds were provided by $270.8 million in proceeds from maturities, sales, calls and prepayments of securities, $73.4 million from the issuance of subordinated debentures and $49.3 million in proceeds from the sale of buildings. The Company also used funds of $562.4 million, $19.7 million and $9.9 million for the repayment of long-term borrowed funds, dividend payments and purchases of treasury stock, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAt the time of the Bank's conversion from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank, the Bank was required by its primary regulator to establish a liquidation account which is reduced as and to the extent that eligible account holders reduce their qualifying deposits. Upon completion of the Merger, the liquidation account was assumed by the Bank. The balance of the liquidation account at December 31, 2016 was $0.7 million. In the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of the Bank, each eligible account holder will be entitled to receive a distribution from the liquidation account. The Bank is not permitted to declare or pay a dividend or to repurchase any of its capital stock if the effect would be to cause the Bank's regulatory capital to be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account but approval of the NYDFS Superintendent is required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years less prior dividends paid. Flushing Financial Corporation is subject to the same regulatory restrictions on the declaration of dividends as the Bank.\nRegulatory Capital Position. Under applicable regulatory capital regulations, the Bank and the Company are required to comply with each of four separate capital adequacy standards: leverage capital, common equity Tier I risk-based capital, Tier I risk-based capital and total risk-based capital. Such classifications are used by the FDIC and other bank regulatory agencies to determine matters ranging from each institution's quarterly FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments, to approvals of applications authorizing institutions to grow their asset size or otherwise expand business activities. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bank and the Company exceeded each of their four regulatory capital requirements. (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.)\n 72 \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's accounting policies are integral to understanding the results of operations and statement of financial condition. These policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Several of these policies require management's judgment to determine the value of the Company's assets and liabilities. The Company has established detailed written policies and control procedures to ensure consistent application of these policies. The Company has identified four accounting policies that require significant management valuation judgment: the allowance for loan losses, fair value of financial instruments, including other-than-temporary impairment assessment, goodwill impairment and income taxes.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. An allowance for loan losses is provided to absorb probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by reviewing all impaired loans on an individual basis. The remaining portfolio is evaluated based on the Company's historical loss experience, recent trends in losses, collection policies and collection experience, trends in the volume of non-performing loans, changes in the composition and volume of the gross loan portfolio, and local and national economic conditions. Judgment is required to determine how many years of historical loss experience are to be included when reviewing historical loss experience. A full credit cycle must be used, or loss estimates may be inaccurate. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available.\nNotwithstanding the judgment required in assessing the components of the allowance for loan losses, the Company believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The policy has been applied on a consistent basis for all periods presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. The Company carries certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value under the fair value option. Fair value is considered the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Management selected the fair value option for certain investment securities, primarily mortgage-backed securities, and certain borrowings. Changes in the fair value of financial instruments for which the fair value election is made are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income. At December 31, 2016, financial assets and financial liabilities with fair values of $30.4 million and $34.0 million, respectively, are carried at fair value under the fair value option.\nThe securities portfolio also consists of mortgage-backed and other securities for which the fair value election was not selected. These securities are classified as available for sale or held-to-maturity. Securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, with changes in fair value recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Securities held-to-maturity are carried at their amortized cost in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. If any decline in fair value for securities classified available for sale or held-to-maturity is deemed other-than-temporary, the security is written down to a new cost basis with the resulting loss recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2016 and 2015, no other-than-temporary impairment charges were recorded.\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities reported at fair value are required to be measured based on the following alternatives: (1) quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments (Level 1), (2) significant other observable inputs (Level 2), or (3) significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). Judgment is required in selecting the appropriate level to be used to determine fair value. The majority of financial assets and financial liabilities for which the fair value election was made, and the majority of investments classified as available for sale and held-to-maturity, were measured using Level 2 inputs, which require judgment to determine the fair value. The trust preferred securities held in the investment portfolio, and the Company's junior subordinated debentures, were measured using Level 3 inputs due to the inactive market for these securities.\nGoodwill Impairment. Goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite life and is tested for impairment, rather than amortized, on at least an annual basis. For the purpose of goodwill impairment testing, management has concluded that the Company has one reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, there is no impairment of goodwill. However, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, further evaluation is required to determine if a write down of goodwill is required.\n 73 \nQuoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are to be used as the basis for measurement, when available. Other acceptable valuation methods include an asset approach, which determines a fair value based upon the value of assets net of liabilities, an income approach, which determines fair value using one or more methods that convert anticipated economic benefits into a present single amount, and a market approach, which determines a fair value based on the similar businesses that have been sold.\nThe Company conducts its annual qualitative impairment testing of goodwill as of December 31. The impairment testing as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 did not show an impairment of goodwill based on the fair value of the Company.\nIncome Taxes. The Company estimates its income taxes payable based on the amounts it expects to owe to the various taxing authorizes (i.e. federal, state and local). In estimating income taxes, management assesses the relative merits and risks of the tax treatment of transactions, taking into account statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the Company's tax position. Management also relies on tax opinions, recent audits, and historical experience.\nThe Company also recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets that the Company estimates are more likely than not to be unrealizable, based on evidence available at the time the estimate is made. These estimates can be affected by changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates, and future income levels.\nContractual Obligations\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due By Period </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3 </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5 </td> <td> </td> <td>Than </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>Years </td> <td> </td> <td>Years </td> <td> </td> <td>5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,266,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>550,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>408,201 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>273,423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,959 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deposits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,205,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,477,852 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>649,794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,274 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan commitments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>322,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>322,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating lease obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,477 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,711 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchase obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,652 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Pension and other postretirement </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>benefits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,063 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,076 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,370 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deferred compensation plans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,034 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,892,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,365,220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,075,911 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>366,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,348 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have significant obligations that arise in the normal course of business. We finance our assets with deposits and borrowings. We also use borrowings to manage our interest-rate risk. Borrowings with call provisions are included in the period of the next call date. We have the means to refinance these borrowings as they mature or are called through financing arrangements with the FHLB-NY and our ability to arrange repurchase agreements with broker-dealers and the FHLB-NY. (See Notes 8 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.)\nWe focus our balance sheet growth on the origination of mortgage loans. At December 31, 2016, we had commitments to extend credit and lines of credit of $322.7 million for mortgage and other loans. These loans will be funded through principal and interest payments received on existing mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, growth in customer deposits, and, when necessary, additional borrowings. (See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.)\nAt December 31, 2016, the Bank had 19 branches, which were all leased. The Bank leases its branch locations primarily when it is not the sole tenant. Whether the Bank will purchase its future branch locations will depend in part on the availability of suitable locations and the availability of properties. In addition, we lease our executive offices. We currently outsource our data processing, loan servicing and check processing functions. We believe that this is the most cost effective method for obtaining these services. These arrangements are usually volume dependent and have varying terms. The contracts for these services usually include annual increases based on the increase in the consumer price index. The amounts shown above for purchase obligations represent the current term and volume of activity of these contracts. We expect to renew these contracts as they expire.\n 74 \nThe amounts shown for pension and other postretirement benefits reflect our directors' pension plan and the supplemental retirement benefits of our president, and amounts due under our plan for medical and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The amount shown in the Less Than 1 Year\u201d column represents our current estimate for these benefits, some of which are based on information supplied by actuaries. The amounts shown in columns reflecting periods over one year represent our current estimate based on the past year's actual disbursements and information supplied by actuaries. The amounts do not include an increase for possible future retirees or increases in health plan costs. The amount shown in the More Than 5 Years\u201d column represents the amount required to increase the total amount to the projected benefit obligation of the directors' plan and the medical and life insurance benefit plans, since these are unfunded plans and the underfunded portion of the employee pension plan. (See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.)\nWe currently provide a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for officers who have achieved the designated level and completed one year of service. However, certain officers who have not reached the designated level but were already participants remain eligible to participate in the Plan. In addition to the amounts deferred by the officers, we match 50% of their contributions, generally up to a maximum of 5% of the officer's salary. These plans generally require the deferred balance to be credited with earnings at a rate earned by certain mutual funds. Through December 31, 2011, employees could not receive a distribution from these plans until their employment was terminated. The amounts shown in the columns for less than five years represent the estimate of the amounts we will contribute to a rabbi trust with respect to matching contributions under these plans. The amount shown in the More Than 5 Years\u201d column represents the current accrued liability for these plans, adjusted for the activity in the columns for less than five years. This expense is provided in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and the liability has been provided in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAs used in this discussion and analysis, the words we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d and the Company\u201d are used to refer to Flushing Financial Corporation and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, Flushing Bank (the Bank\u201d), Flushing Preferred Funding Corporation, Flushing Service Corporation, and FSB Properties Inc.\nGeneral\nWe are a Delaware corporation organized in May 1994. The Bank was organized in 1929 as a New York State-chartered mutual savings bank. In 1994, the Bank converted to a federally chartered mutual savings bank and changed its name from Flushing Savings Bank to Flushing Savings Bank, FSB. The Bank converted from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank on November 21, 1995, at which time Flushing Financial Corporation acquired all of the stock of the Bank. On February 28, 2013, the Bank's charter was changed to a full-service New York State chartered commercial bank, and its name was changed to Flushing Bank. As a result of the Bank's change in charter to a full-service New York State chartered commercial bank, the Bank's primary regulator became the New York State Department of Financial Services, and its primary federal regulator became the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC\u201d). The Bank's deposits are insured to the maximum allowable amount by the FDIC. The Bank owns three subsidiaries: Flushing Preferred Funding Corporation, Flushing Service Corporation, and FSB Properties Inc.\nFlushing Financial Corporation also owns Flushing Financial Capital Trust II, Flushing Financial Capital Trust III, and Flushing Financial Capital Trust IV (the Trusts\u201d), which are special purpose business trusts formed during 2007 to issue a total of $60.0 million of capital securities, and $1.9 million of common securities (which are the only voting securities). Flushing Financial Corporation owns 100% of the common securities of the Trusts. The Trusts used the proceeds from the issuance of these securities to purchase junior subordinated debentures from Flushing Financial Corporation. The Trusts are not included in our consolidated financial statements as we would not absorb the losses of the Trusts if losses were to occur.\nThe following discussion of financial condition and results of operations includes the collective results of the Flushing Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company\u201d), but reflects principally the Bank's activities. Management views the Company as operating as a single unit - a community bank. Therefore, segment information is not provided.\nThe Bank has a business banking unit which focuses on the development of a full complement of commercial business deposit, loan and cash management products. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the business banking unit had $613.0 million and $525.3 million, respectively, in gross loans outstanding and $144.4 million and $146.3 million, respectively, of customer deposits.\nThe Bank has an internet branch, iGObanking.com\u00ae, which provides access to consumers in markets outside our geographic locations. Accounts can be opened online at www.iGObanking.com or by mail. IGObanking.com\u00ae does not currently accept loan applications. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, iGObanking.com\u00ae had $417.3 million and $323.7 million, respectively, of customer deposits.\nThe Bank has a governmental banking unit, which provides banking services to public entities including counties, cities, towns, villages, school districts, libraries, fire districts and the various courts throughout the New York City metropolitan area. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the government banking unit had $1,062.1 million and $975.9 million, respectively, in customer deposits.\nOverview\nOur principal business is attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those deposits together with funds generated from ongoing operations and borrowings, primarily in (1) originations and purchases of multi-family residential properties, commercial business loans, commercial real estate mortgage loans and, to a lesser extent, one-to-four family (focusing on mixed-use properties, which are properties that contain both residential dwelling units and commercial units); (2) construction loans, primarily for residential properties; (3) Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) loans and other small business loans; (4) mortgage loan surrogates such as mortgage-backed securities; and (5) U.S. government securities, corporate fixed-income securities and other marketable securities. We also originate certain other consumer loans including overdraft lines of credit. Our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on its interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the result of our interest rate margin, which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, adjusted for the difference in the average balance of interest-earning assets as compared to the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. We also generate non-interest income from loan fees, service charges on deposit accounts, mortgage servicing fees, and other fees, income earned on Bank Owned Life Insurance ( BOLI\u201d), dividends on Federal Home Bank of New York ( FHLB-NY\u201d) stock and net gains and losses on sales of securities and loans. Our operating expenses consist principally of employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, other general and administrative expenses and income tax expense. Our results of operations also can be significantly affected by our periodic provision for loan losses and specific provision for losses on real estate owned.\n 58 \nManagement Strategy. Our strategy is to continue our focus on being an institution serving consumers, businesses, and governmental units in our local markets. In furtherance of this objective, we intend to:\n \u00b7 Increase core deposits and continue to improve funding mix; \n \u00b7 increase net interest income by leveraging loan pricing opportunities; \n \u00b7 enhance earnings by managing net interest margin and improving scalability and efficiency; \n \u00b7 manage credit risk; \n \u00b7 maintain well capitalized levels under all stress test scenarios; \n \u00b7 increase our commitment to the multi-cultural marketplace, with a particular focus on the Asian community in Queens; \n \u00b7 manage enterprise-wide risk. \nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively implement this strategy. Our strategy is subject to change by the Board of Directors.\nIncrease core deposits and continue to improve funding mix. We have a relatively stable retail deposit base drawn from our market area through our full-service offices. Although we seek to retain existing deposits and maintain depositor relationships by offering quality service and competitive interest rates to our customers, we also seek to keep deposit growth within reasonable limits and our strategic plan. In order to implement our strategic plan, we have built multi-channel deposit gathering capabilities. The business banking operation was designed specifically to develop full business relationships thereby bringing in lower-costing checking and money market deposits. At December 31, 2016, deposits balances in the business sector are $144.4 million. We also have iGObanking.com\u00ae\u201d, as a division of the Bank, to compete for deposits from sources outside the geographic footprint of our full-service offices. In creating iGObanking.com\u00ae, our strategy is to reduce our reliance on wholesale borrowings and reduce our funding costs. Deposit balances in iGObanking.com\u00ae were $417.3 million at December 31, 2016, at rates lower than our borrowings. We have a government banking division as an additional source of deposits. At December 31, 2016, deposits in our government banking division totaled $1,062.1 million at rates below our average cost of funds. We also obtain deposits through brokers and the CDARS\u00ae and ICS network. Management intends to balance its goal to maintain competitive interest rates on deposits while seeking to manage its overall cost of funds to finance its strategies. We generally rely on our deposit base as our principal source of funding. During 2016, we realized an increase in due to depositors of $309.7 million, as core deposits increased $340.9 million while certificates of deposit decreased $31.2 million.\nA significant portion of our lending and deposit customers do not have both their loans and deposits with us. We intend to continue to focus on obtaining additional deposits from our lending customers and originating additional loans to our deposit customers. Product offerings were expanded and are expected to be further expanded to accommodate perceived customer demands. In addition, specific employees are assigned responsibilities of generating these additional deposits and loans by coordinating efforts between lending and deposit gathering departments.\n 59 \nIncrease net interest income by leveraging loan pricing opportunities. During 2016, we repositioned our strategy to focus more on loan pricing as opposed to volume. We saw yields on originations increase for the third and fourth quarters of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The average interest rate obtained for third quarter 2016 originations was 3.74% as compared to 3.56% for the 2015 period. For fourth quarter 2016 originations, the average interest rate increased 13 basis points to 3.81% as compared to 3.68% for the 2015 period.\nWe have emphasized the strategic growth of multi-family residential mortgage loans and floating rate commercial business loans. We have re-entered the higher-yielding non-owner occupied commercial real estate lending during 2015. We continued to deemphasize one-to-four family - mixed-use property and construction lending and we no longer provide taxi medallion loans.\nThe following table shows loan originations and purchases during 2016, and loan balances as of December 31, 2016.\n\nAt December 31, 2016, multi-family residential, commercial business and other loans and commercial real estate loans, totaled 83.5% of our gross loans. We have repositioned our loan growth since the Great Recession to reduce credit risk; however, our concentration in these types of loans could require us to increase our provisions for loan losses and to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance currently maintained.\nEnhance earnings by managing net interest margin and improving scalability and efficiency. By taking advantage of loan pricing opportunities and continuing to maintain a lower cost of funds, we actively manage the net interest margin. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased one basis point to 1.07% from 1.08% for the year ended December 31, 2015. During 2017, approximately 47% of our borrowings and certificates of deposits are scheduled to mature or reprice. During 2016, we renovated two branches to the Universal Banker model and plan to renovate three branches during 2017. The Universal Banker model will result in savings of both personnel and occupancy costs while providing our customers with cutting-edge technology.\nManage credit risk. By adherence to our conservative underwriting standards, we have been able to minimize net losses from impaired loans, recording net recoveries of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net charge-offs of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The loan to value for the real estate dependent loan portfolio was 40.5% and the average loan to value for non-performing loans collateralized by real estate was 39.1% at December 31, 2016. We seek to maintain our loans in performing status through, among other things, disciplined collection efforts, and consistently monitoring non-performing assets in an effort to return them to performing status. To this end, we review the quality of our loans and report to the Loan Committee of the Board of Directors of the Bank on a monthly basis. We sold 26 delinquent loans totaling $8.0 million, 23 delinquent loans totaling $9.0 million, and 34 delinquent loans totaling $15.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We recorded net recoveries on delinquent loans that were sold during 2016, 2015 and 2014 of $48,000, $0.1 million and $0.4 million. We realized gross gains of $0.3 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million on the sale of delinquent loans for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We realized gross losses of $2,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. We did not record any gross losses during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2014. There can be no assurances that we will continue this strategy in future periods, or if continued, we will be able to find buyers to pay adequate consideration. Non-performing loans totaled $21.9 million and $31.0 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.36% and 0.54% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n 60 \nMaintain well capitalized levels under all stress test scenarios. The Bank faces several minimum capital requirements imposed by federal regulation. Failure to adhere to these minimums could limit the dividends the Bank is allowed to pay, including the payment of dividends to Flushing Financial Corporation, and could limit the annual growth of the Bank. Under the Dodd Frank Act, banks with assets greater than $10.0 billion in total assets are required to complete stress tests, which predict capital levels under certain stress levels. Although, our total assets are currently $6.1 billion, as a best practice, we completed these tests. As of December 31, 2016, under all stress scenarios, we remain well capitalized per current regulations.\nIncrease Our Commitment to the Multi-Cultural Marketplace, with a Particular Focus on the Asian Community in Queens. Our branches are all located in the New York City metropolitan area with particular concentration in the borough of Queens. Queens is characterized with a high level of ethnic diversity. An important element of our strategy is to service multi-ethnic consumers and businesses. We have a particular presence and concentration in Asian communities, including in particular the Chinese and Korean populations. Both groups are noted for high levels of savings, education and entrepreneurship. In order to service these and other important ethnic groups in our market, our staff speaks more than 30 languages. We have an Asian advisory board to help broaden our links to the community by providing guidance and fostering awareness of our active role in the local community. Through our focus on and commitment to the Asian community in Queens, where we have four branches, we have obtained approximately $500 million in deposits in these branches. We also have over $450 million of loans and lines of credit outstanding to borrowers in the Asian community.\nManage Enterprise-Wide Risk. We identify, measure and attempt to mitigate risks that affect, or have the potential to affect, our business. Due to past economic crises and recent increases in government regulation, we devote significant resources to risk management. We have a seasoned risk officer to provide executive risk leadership, and an enterprise-wide risk management program. Several enterprise risk management analytical products are in use which include key risk indicators. We also have had a chief information security officer even before one will be required by recent NYDFS rulemaking not yet in effect. Our management of enterprise-wide risk enables us to recognize and monitor risks and establish procedures to disseminate the risk information across our organization and to our Board of Directors. The objective is to have a robust and focused risk management process capable of identifying and mitigating emerging threats to the Bank's safety and soundness.\nTrends and Contingencies. Our operating results are significantly affected by national and local economic and competitive conditions, including changes in market interest rates, the strength of the local economy, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. We have remained strategically focused on the origination of multi-family residential mortgages and to a lesser extent, commercial real estate and one-to-four family mixed-use property mortgage loans. However, in late 2014 and throughout 2015 and 2016 we have increased our emphasis on the origination and purchase of business loans with full banking relationships and commercial real estate loans. As a result of this strategy, we were able to continue to achieve a higher yield on our mortgage portfolio than we would have otherwise experienced.\nAs we have seen improvements in the local economy, our non-performing loans have decreased. The majority of our impaired loans are income producing residential properties located in the New York City metropolitan market. Due to the low vacancy rates for these types of properties, they have retained more of their value, thereby reducing their loss content. Non-performing loans totaled $21.4 million, $26.1 million and $34.2 million at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We have not experienced a significant increase in foreclosed properties despite an extended foreclosure process in our market. The extended foreclosure process in our market is due to the high number of foreclosure actions filed in the court system in the counties for which we are seeking foreclosure on delinquent mortgage loans. We have not encountered significant issues with documentation relating to mortgages for which we are seeking foreclosure as we maintain custody of all loan documents and review them prior to providing them to our legal counsel to initiate the foreclosure action. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded net recoveries of $0.7 million compared to net charge-offs of $2.6 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This improvement in net charge-offs allowed us to not record a provision for loan losses during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to benefits of $1.0 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We cannot predict the effect of these economic conditions on the Company's future financial condition or operating results.\n 61 \nLoan originations and purchases were $1,132.9 million, $1,233.5 million and $958.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. While we primarily rely on originating our own loans, we purchased $186.7 million, $278.9 million and $169.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We purchase loans when the loans complement our loan portfolio strategy. Loans purchased must meet our underwriting standards when they were originated.\nDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, the allocation of our loan portfolio has remained fairly consistent. The majority of our loans are collateralized by real estate, which comprised 86.9% of our portfolio at December 31, 2016 compared to 87.7% at December 31, 2015 and 87.4% at December 31, 2014. Multi-family residential mortgage loans comprised 45.2%, 47.0% and 50.6% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Commercial real estate mortgage loans comprised 25.9%, 22.9% and 16.4% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. One-to-four family mixed-use property mortgage loans comprised 11.6%, 13.1% and 15.1% of loan portfolio at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. One-to-four family residential mortgage loans comprised 3.9%, 4.3% and 4.9% of loan portfolio at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDue to depositors increased $309.7 million, $382.8 million and $272.9 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Lower-costing core deposits increased $340.9 million, $285.3 million and $88.1 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Higher-costing certificates of deposit decreased $31.2 million during 2016 compared to increases $97.5 million during 2015 and $184.9 million during 2014. Brokered deposits represented 26.5%, 25.2% and 21.8% of total deposits at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nPrevailing interest rates affect the extent to which borrowers repay and refinance loans. In a declining interest rate environment, the number of loan prepayments and loan refinancing tends to increase, as do prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. Call provisions associated with our investments in U.S. government agency and corporate securities may also adversely affect yield in a declining interest rate environment. Such prepayments and calls may adversely affect the yield of our loan portfolio and mortgage-backed and other securities as we reinvest the prepaid funds in a lower interest rate environment. However, we typically receive additional loan fees when existing loans are refinanced, which partially offsets the reduced yield on our loan portfolio resulting from prepayments. In periods of low interest rates, our level of core deposits also may decline if depositors seek higher-yielding instruments or other investments not offered by us, which in turn may increase our cost of funds and decrease our net interest margin to the extent alternative funding sources, are utilized. By contrast, an increasing interest rate environment would tend to extend the average lives of lower yielding fixed rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, which could adversely affect net interest income. In addition, depositors tend to open longer term, higher costing certificate of deposit accounts which could adversely affect our net interest income if rates were to subsequently decline. Additionally, adjustable rate residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities generally contain interim and lifetime caps that limit the amount the interest rate can increase at re-pricing dates.\nWe attempt to pursue the guarantor on all loans for which a loss has been incurred and for which a guarantee was obtained, when, after considering the benefits and costs, we have concluded we will be successful in recovering at least a portion of the loss we incurred. The success of this pursuit is based on the assets the guarantor holds when we obtain a judgment.\nDuring 2016, we sought performance under guarantees on three business loans, seeking judgment of approximately $3.6 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had received $6,000 on these business loans. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we realized recoveries of approximately $50,000 on business loans for which we sought judgments prior to 2016. During 2015, we sought performance under guarantees on two business loans, seeking judgment of approximately $2.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we realized recoveries of approximately $0.3 million on business loans and $0.1 million on real estate mortgage loans for which we sought judgments prior to 2015.\n 62 \nDuring 2016 our net interest income increased $12.7 million, or 8.20%, to $167.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from $154.4 million for the comparable prior year period, as a seven basis point decrease in the net interest margin to 2.97% for the twelve month ended December 31, 2016 was more than offset by balance sheet growth. The decrease in the net interest margin for 2016 was primarily due to a decline in the yield of our interest-earning assets, partially offset by a reduction in our funding costs. The decline in the yield of our interest earning assets was primarily due to rates earned on new loans originated and securities purchased during 2016 being lower than the yield of the existing portfolio. During 2016, the average balance of total loans, net increased $567.2 million to $4,600.7 million. During 2016, the average balance of borrowed funds increased by $126.6 million to $1,231.0 million compared to $1,104.4 million for 2015, while the cost of borrowed funds decreased nine basis points to 1.67% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 1.76% in the comparable period. The cost of certificates of deposit accounts decreased nine basis points for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from the prior year, while the cost of money market accounts, NOW and savings accounts increased 21 basis points, seven basis points and four basis points, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from the prior year. The cost of money market accounts increased primarily due to our shifting of Government NOW deposits to an Insured Cash Sweep service ( ICS\u201d) brokered money market product, which does not require us to provide collateral. This allows us to invest our funds in higher yielding assets. The cost of savings and NOW accounts increased as we increased the rates we pay on certain accounts to attract additional deposits. This resulted in an increase in the cost of due to depositors of one basis point to 0.89% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from 0.88% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Overall, as a result of these changes to our funding mix we were able to reduce our cost of interest-bearing liabilities one basis point to 1.07% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 1.08% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe are unable to predict the direction or timing of future interest rate changes. Approximately 47% of our certificates of deposit accounts and borrowings reprice or mature during the next year, which could result in a decrease in the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Also, in a decreasing interest rate environment, mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities with higher rates tend to prepay, which could result in a reduction in the yield on our interest-earning assets.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity Analysis\nA financial institution's exposure to the risks of changing interest rates may be analyzed, in part, by examining the extent to which its assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive\u201d and by monitoring the institution's interest rate sensitivity gap.\u201d An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period. Accordingly, a positive gap may enhance net interest income in a rising rate environment and reduce net interest income in a falling rate environment. Conversely, a negative gap may enhance net interest income in a falling rate environment and reduce net interest income in a rising rate environment.\nThe table below sets forth the amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding at December 31, 2016 which are anticipated by the Company, based upon certain assumptions, to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except as stated below, the amount of assets and liabilities shown that reprice or mature during a particular period was determined in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability. Prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities are based on our experience and industry averages, which generally range from 6% to 36%, depending on the contractual rate of interest and the underlying collateral. Money market accounts and savings accounts were assumed to have a withdrawal or run-off\u201d rate of 14% and 23%, respectively, based on our experience. While management bases these assumptions on actual prepayments and withdrawals experienced by us, there is no guarantee that these trends will continue in the future.\n 63 \n\n(1) Consists of interest-earning deposits.\n(2) Does not include non-interest bearing demand accounts totaling $333.2 million at December 31, 2016.\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar estimated maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in differing degrees to changes in market interest rates and may bear rates that differ in varying degrees from the rates that would apply upon maturity and reinvestment or upon repricing. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as ARM loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a significant change in the level of interest rates, prepayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities, and deposit withdrawal or run-off\u201d levels, would likely deviate materially from those assumed in calculating the above table. In the event of an interest rate increase, some borrowers may be unable to meet the increased payments on their adjustable-rate debt. The interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes that the nature of the Company's assets and liabilities remains static. Interest rates may have an effect on customer preferences for deposits and loan products. Finally, the maturity and repricing characteristics of many assets and liabilities as set forth in the above table are not governed by contract but rather by management's best judgment based on current market conditions and anticipated business strategies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in fair value of certain investments due to changes in interest rates. Generally, the fair value of financial investments such as loans and securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. As a result, increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the fair value of our interest-earning assets which could adversely affect our results of operations if such assets were sold, or, in the case of securities classified as available for sale, decreases in our stockholders' equity if such securities were retained.\n 64 \nWe manage the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities on a continuous basis to maximize return and adjust our exposure to interest rate risk. On a quarterly basis, management prepares the Earnings and Economic Exposure to Changes in Interest Rate\u201d report for review by the Board of Directors, as summarized below. This report quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and net portfolio value should interest rates go up or down (shocked) 200 basis points, assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other. Net portfolio value is defined as the market value of assets net of the market value of liabilities. The market value of assets and liabilities is determined using a discounted cash flow calculation. The net portfolio value ratio is the ratio of the net portfolio value to the market value of assets. All changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and net portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario. The base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at December 31, 2015. Various estimates regarding prepayment assumptions are made at each level of rate shock. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. At December 31, 2016, we were within the guidelines established by the Board of Directors for each interest rate level.\n\nAnalysis of Net Interest Income\nNet interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends upon the relative amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them.\nThe following table sets forth certain information relating to our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. Average balances are derived from average daily balances. The yields include amortization of fees that are considered adjustments to yields.\n 65 \n\n (1) Average balances include non-accrual loans. \n (2) Loan interest income includes loan fee income (which includes net amortization of deferred fees and costs, late charges, and prepayment penalties) of approximately $4.2 million, $4.2 million and $5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \n (3) Interest income on tax-exempt securities does not include the tax benefit of the tax-exempt securities. \n (4) Interest rate spread represents the difference between the average rate on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. \n (5) Net interest margin represents net interest income before the provision for loan losses divided by average interest-earning assets. \n (6) Borrowings expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, excludes prepayment penalties incurred from the extinguishment of debt to conform to the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2016. These penalties are reflected in non-interest expense. \n 66 \nRate/Volume Analysis\nThe following table presents the impact of changes in interest rates and in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities on the Company's interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to (1) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by the prior rate), (2) changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by the prior volume) and (3) the net change. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate.\n\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nGeneral. Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $64.9 million, an increase of $18.7 million, or 40.48%, compared to $46.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Diluted earnings per common share were $2.24 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $0.65, or 40.88%, from $1.59 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nReturn on average equity increased to 13.07% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, from 9.93% for the prior year. Return on average assets increased to 1.10% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, from 0.86% for the prior year.\nInterest Income. Interest income increased $16.9 million, or 8.25%, to $221.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $204.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase of $542.6 million in the average balance of interest-earning assets to $5,626.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $5,084.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was partially offset by a nine basis point reduction in the yield of interest-earning assets to 3.93% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 4.02% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The nine basis point decline in the yield of interest-earning assets was primarily due to a 19 basis point reduction in the yield on the loan portfolio to 4.24% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from 4.43% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by a 10 basis point increase in the yield on total securities to 2.65% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from 2.55% for the prior year. The 19 basis point decrease in the yield on the loan portfolio was primarily due to a decline in the rates earned on new loan originations and existing loans modified to lower rates. The 10 basis point increase in the yield on the securities portfolio was primarily due to the purchase of new securities at higher yields than the existing portfolio. The yield on the loan portfolio, excluding prepayment penalty income on loans, decreased 17 basis points to 4.10% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from 4.27 % for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\n 67 \nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $4.2 million, or 8.42%, to $53.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase of $449.5 million in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities to $5,036.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $4,586.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was partially offset by a decrease of one basis point in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 1.07% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 1.08% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The one basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily attributable to decreases of nine basis points in each of the cost of certificates of deposit and borrowed funds. The decrease in the cost of certificates of deposit and borrowed funds was primarily due to maturing issuances being replaced at lower rates. Additionally, the cost of borrowed funds benefited from the early extinguishment of $130.0 million in FHLB-NY advances at an average cost of 2.82% and $78.0 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase, at an average cost of 3.80% during 2016. These decreases were partially offset by increases of 21 basis points, seven basis points and four basis points in the cost of money market, NOW and savings accounts, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from the comparable prior year period. The cost of money market accounts increased primarily due to our shifting of Government NOW deposits to a money market product which does not require us to provide collateral, allowing us to invest these funds in higher yielding assets. The cost of NOW and savings accounts increased as we increased the rate we pay on some of our products to attract additional deposits. Additionally, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was negatively affected by increases of $126.6 million and $58.2 million in the average balance of higher costing borrowed funds and certificates of deposit, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, which was partially offset by an increase of $261.0 million in the average balance of lower-costing core deposits during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 to $2,339.1 million from $2,078.1 million for the comparable prior year period.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $167.1 million, an increase of $12.7 million, or 8.20%, from $154.4 million for 2015. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to the growth of net interest-earning assets. These improvements to net interest income were partially offset by a decrease in the net interest spread of eight basis points to 2.86% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from 2.94% for the prior year. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased nine basis points to 3.93% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 4.02% for the year ended December 31, 2015, while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased one basis point to 1.07% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 1.08% for the prior year period. The net interest margin decreased seven basis points to 2.97% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 3.04% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding prepayment penalty income, the net interest margin would have been 2.85% and 2.91% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nProvision (Benefit) for Loan Losses. There was no provision or benefit for loan losses recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to a benefit of $1.0 million recorded during the comparable prior year period. No provision was recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 due to the Company's analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses indicating that the reserve was at an appropriate level. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, non-accrual loans decreased $1.8 million to $21.0 million from $22.8 million at December 31, 2015. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Bank recorded net recoveries totaling $0.7 million, or two basis points of average loans. The current average loan-to-value ratio for our non-performing loans collateralized by real estate was 39.1% at December 31, 2016. When we have obtained properties through foreclosure, we have been able to quickly sell the properties at amounts that approximate book value. The Bank continues to maintain conservative underwriting standards. We anticipate that we will continue to see low loss content in our loan portfolio.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $57.5 million, an increase of $41.8 million, or 266.03%, from $15.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to an increase of $41.5 million in net gains on the sale of buildings, as we sold three of our branch buildings during each of the years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015 in sale-leaseback transactions. Additionally, non-interest income increased due to an increase in net gains from the sale of securities of $1.4 million and a gain from life insurance proceeds of $0.5 million. These increases were partially offset by a $1.6 million increase in net losses from fair value adjustments.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense was $118.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $20.9 million, or 21.37%, from $97.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to increases of $10.4 million in prepayment penalties from the early extinguishment of debt during 2016, $7.7 million in salaries and benefits expense, $1.6 million in other operating expenses, $0.9 million in depreciation and amortization expense and $0.6 million in professional services expense from increases in legal and consulting expenses. The increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to annual salary increases and additions in staffing in retail, audit and compliance departments, as well as increases in production incentives and the cost of split dollar life insurance benefits. The increase in other operating expenses was due to a $1.4 million increase in net losses on the sale of OREO recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the write-down and subsequent sale of one OREO. The growth in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the opening of two new branches along with the move to our new corporate headquarters both occurring during 2015. The efficiency ratio was 59.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to 58.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\n 68 \nIncome Tax Provisions. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $13.9 million, or 51.30%, to $41.1 million, compared to $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $32.6 million increase in income before income taxes and an increase in the effective tax rate to 38.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from 37.0% in the comparable prior year period. The increase in the effective tax rate reflects the reduced impact that preferential tax items had on the Company's tax liability during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nGeneral. Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was $46.2 million, an increase of $2.0 million, or 4.45%, compared to $44.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. Diluted earnings per common share were $1.59 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $0.11, or 7.43%, from $1.48 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nReturn on average equity increased to 9.93% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, from 9.82% for the prior year. Return on average assets decreased to 0.86% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, from 0.91% for the prior year.\nThe prepayment penalty for the extinguishment of debt totaling $5.2 million, recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014, has been reclassified from interest expense to non-interest expense to conform to the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest Income. Interest income increased $7.0 million, or 3.56%, to $204.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $197.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase of $500.5 million in the average balance of interest-earning assets to $5,084.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $4,583.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was partially offset by a 28 basis point reduction in the yield of interest-earning assets to 4.02% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 4.30% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The 28 basis point decline in the yield of interest-earning assets was primarily due to a 41 basis point reduction in the yield on the loan portfolio to 4.43% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from 4.84% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, combined with a seven basis point decline in the yield on total securities to 2.55% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from 2.62% for the prior year. The 41 basis point decrease in the yield on the loan portfolio was primarily due to a decline in the rates earned on new loan originations and existing loans modified to lower rates. The seven basis point decrease in the yield on the securities portfolio was primarily due to the purchase of new securities at lower yields than the existing portfolio. The yield on the loan portfolio, excluding prepayment penalty income on loans, decreased 40 basis points to 4.27% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from 4.67 % for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $0.2 million, or 0.35%, to $49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase of $450.0 million in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities to $4,586.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $4,136.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was partially offset by a decrease of 12 basis points in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 1.08% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 1.20% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The 12 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily attributable to decreases of 32 basis points and 20 basis points in the cost of certificates of deposit and borrowed funds, respectively. The decrease in the cost of certificates of deposit and borrowed funds was primarily due to maturing issuances being replaced at lower rates. These decreases were partially offset by increases of 20 basis points and 14 basis points in the cost of savings and money market accounts, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from the comparable prior year period. The cost of savings accounts increased as we increased the rate we pay on some of our savings products to attract additional deposits. The cost of money market accounts increased primarily due to our shifting of Government NOW deposits to a money market product which does not require us to provide collateral, allowing us to invest these funds in higher yielding assets. Additionally, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was negatively affected by increases of $151.8 million and $110.6 million in the average balance of higher costing certificates of deposit and borrowed funds, respectively, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, which was partially offset by an increase of $183.2 million in the average balance of lower-costing core deposits during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 to $2,078.1 million from $1,894.9 million for the comparable prior year period.\n 69 \nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $154.4 million, an increase of $6.8 million, or 4.64%, from $147.6 million for 2014. The increase in net interest income was due to the growth of net interest-earning assets and an increase in prepayment penalty income. These improvements to net interest income were partially offset by a decrease in the net interest spread of 16 basis points to 2.94% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from 3.10% for the prior year. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased 28 basis points to 4.02% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 4.30% for the year ended December 31, 2014, while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 12 basis points to 1.08% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 1.20% for the prior year period. The net interest margin decreased 18 basis points to 3.04% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 3.22% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding prepayment penalty income, the net interest margin would have been 2.91% and 3.09% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nProvision (Benefit) for Loan Losses. The benefit for loan losses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was $1.0 million, a decrease of $5.1 million, or 84.12%, from a benefit of $6.0 million during the comparable prior year period. The benefit recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the continued improvement in both credit conditions and, the qualitative factors used in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, non-accrual loans decreased $9.1 million to $22.8 million from $31.9 million at December 31, 2014. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, net charge-offs totaled $2.6 million, or six basis points of average loans, primarily as a result of two business loans which the Bank deemed unrecoverable. The current average loan-to-value ratio for our non-performing loans collateralized by real estate was 41.4% at December 31, 2015. When we have obtained properties through foreclosure, we have been able to quickly sell the properties at amounts that approximate book value. The Bank continues to maintain conservative underwriting standards. We anticipate that we will continue to see low loss content in our loan portfolio. As a result of the quarterly analysis of the allowance for loans losses, a reduction in the allowance was warranted and, as such, the Company recorded a benefit of $1.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was $15.7 million, an increase of $5.5 million, or 53.46%, from $10.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to an increase of $6.5 million in net gains on the sale of buildings, as we sold and leased back our Brooklyn branch buildings, and increases of $0.4 million in net gains on the sale of loans and $0.3 million in other income. Additionally, non-interest income increased due to a decrease of $0.7 million in net losses from fair value adjustments. These improvements to non-interest income were partially offset by a decrease of $2.7 million in net gains on the sale of securities, primarily due to the comparable prior year period including a net gain on the sale of securities totaling $2.9 million which was comprised of net gains on the sale of securities, as part of a balance sheet deleveraging and net losses on the sale of securities from the sale of substandard trust preferred securities.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense was $97.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $6.7 million, or 7.35%, from $91.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to increases of $4.1 million in salaries and benefits, $3.3 million in other operating expenses and $2.2 million in occupancy and equipment expense. The increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to annual salary increases, increases in staffing in the technology, risk/compliance and retail departments, as well as an increase in restricted stock expense. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to $1.0 million in expenses related to the move of our corporate headquarters, $0.9 million in expenses related to the growth of the Company, $0.7 million in net losses on the sale of OREO and $0.5 million in additional temporary staffing and hiring fees. Other operating expenses also included $0.3 million in ATM fraud losses recorded in 2015. The growth in occupancy and equipment expense was primarily due to increases in rent expense of $1.4 million for our new corporate headquarters and new branch at the same location and $0.6 million from additional space in Manhattan for Business Bankers and a new branch location, which opened in September 2015. Occupancy and equipment expense also included $0.2 million recorded in 2015 for temporary staff for additional security to guard against further ATM fraud losses. Additionally, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the Company also experienced increases of $1.1 million in professional services, primarily due to increased legal and compliance costs and $0.8 million, $0.5 million and $0.3 million in depreciation and amortization expense, FDIC insurance expense and data processing expense, respectively, primarily due to the growth of the Bank. OREO/foreclosure expenses decreased $0.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 due to such period including recoveries of legal fees and a reduction in the level of non-performing loans. These increases were partially offset by the prior year including a $5.2 million prepayment penalty recorded on borrowings as a result of the Bank prepaying $66.9 million in long-term FHLB-NY advances and $30.0 million in repurchase agreements. The efficiency ratio increased to 58.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from 54.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the increased expenses discussed above.\n 70 \nIncome Tax Provisions. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $1.4 million, or 4.92%, to $27.2 million, compared to $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the effective tax rate to 37.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from 39.2% in the comparable prior year period, partially offset by an increase of $0.6 million in income before income taxes. The decrease in the effective tax rate reflects the impact of a change in New York City tax law enacted in 2015, which based on the Company's lending mix and certain other factors, reduced our New York City tax liability. Additionally, the decrease in the effective tax rate reflects the greater impact that preferential tax items had on the Company's tax liability during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity, Regulatory Capital and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, principal and interest payments on loans, mortgage-backed and other securities, and proceeds from sales of securities and loans. Deposit flows and mortgage prepayments, however, are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. At December 31, 2016, the Bank was able to borrow up to $2,703.1 million from the FHLB-NY in Federal Home Loan Bank advances and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank had $1,506.4 million outstanding in combined balances of FHLB-NY advances and letters of credit. At December 31, 2015, the Bank also has unsecured lines of credit with other commercial banks totaling $100.0 million. In addition, Flushing Financial Corporation has subordinated debentures totaling $73.4 million and junior subordinated debentures with a face amount of $61.9 million and a carrying amount of $34.0 million (which are both included in Borrowed Funds). (See Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.) Management believes its available sources of funds are sufficient to fund current operations.\nOur most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which include cash and due from banks, overnight interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold with original maturities of 90 days or less. The level of these assets is dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled $35.9 million, a decrease of $6.5 million from December 31, 2015. We also held marketable securities available for sale with a market value of $861.4 million at December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had commitments to extend credit (principally real estate mortgage loans) of $78.1 million and open lines of credit for borrowers (principally business lines of credit and home equity loan lines of credit) of $244.6 million. Since generally all of the loan commitments are expected to be drawn upon, the total loan commitments approximate future cash requirements, whereas the amounts of lines of credit may not be indicative of our future cash requirements. The loan commitments generally expire in 90 days, while construction loan lines of credit mature within 18 months and home equity loan lines of credit mature within 10 years. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments.\nOur total interest expense and operating expense in 2016 were $53.9 million and $118.6 million, respectively.\nWe maintain three postretirement defined benefit plans for our employees: a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan which was frozen as of September 30, 2006, a contributory medical plan, and a noncontributory life insurance plan. The life insurance plan was amended to discontinue providing life insurance benefits to future retirees after January 1, 2010 and the medical plan was frozen as of January 1, 2011. We also maintain a noncontributory defined benefit plan for certain of our non-employee directors, which was frozen as of January 1, 2004. The employee pension plan is the only plan that we have funded. During 2016, we incurred cash expenditures of $0.1 million for the medical and life insurance plans and $0.1 million for the non-employee director plan; we did not make a contribution to the employee pension plan in 2016. We expect to pay similar amounts for these plans in 2016. (See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.)\nThe amounts reported in our financial statements are obtained from reports prepared by independent actuaries, and are based on significant assumptions. The most significant assumption is the discount rate used to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation ( APBO\u201d) for these plans. The APBO is the present value of projected benefits that employees and retirees have earned to date. The discount rate is a single rate at which the liabilities of the plans are discounted into today's dollars and could be effectively settled or eliminated. The discount rate used is based on the Citigroup Pension Liability Index, and reflects a rate that could be earned on bonds over a similar period that we anticipate the plans' liabilities will be paid. An increase in the discount rate would reduce the APBO, while a reduction in the discount rate would increase the APBO. During the past several years, when interest rates have been at historically low levels, the discount rate used for our plans has declined from 7.25% for 2001 to 3.88% for 2016. This decline in the discount rate has resulted in an increase in our APBO.\n 71 \nThe Company's actuaries use several other assumptions that could have a significant impact on our APBO and periodic expense for these plans. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, expected rate of return on plan assets, future increases in medical and life insurance premiums, turnover rates of employees, and life expectancy. The accounting standards for postretirement plans involve mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility of earnings by allowing changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations to be amortized over time when actual results differ from the assumptions used, there are changes in the assumptions used, or there are plan amendments. At December 31, 2016, our employee pension plan and medical and life insurance plan have unrecognized losses of $8.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The non-employee director plan has a $0.5 million unrecognized gain, due to experience different from what had been estimated and changes in actuarial assumptions. The employee pension plan's unrecognized loss is primarily attributed to the reduction in the discount rate and change in the Plan's mortality table. The medical and life insurance plans' unrecognized loss is attributed to the reduction in the discount rate over the past several years. In addition, the non-employee director pension plan has an unrecognized past service liability of $0.1 million due to plan amendments in prior years and the medical and life insurance plan have a $0.5 million past service credit due to plan amendments. The net after tax effect of the unrecognized gains and losses associated with these plans has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity, resulting in a reduction of stockholders' equity of $4.5 million as of December 31, 2016.\nThe change in the discount rate, the Pension Plan's mortality table and the reduction in medical premiums are the only significant changes made to the assumptions used for these plans for each of three years ended December 31, 2015. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the actual return on the employee pension plan assets was approximately 90%, 31% and 74%, respectively, of the assumed return used to determine the periodic pension expense for that respective year.\nThe market value of the assets of our employee pension plan is $20.5 million at December 31, 2016, which is $2.3 million less than the projected benefit obligation. We do not anticipate a change in the market value of these assets which would have a significant effect on liquidity, capital resources, or results of operations.\nDuring 2016, funds provided by the Company's operating activities amounted to $42.4 million. These funds combined with $273.3 million provided from financing activities and $42.4 million available at the beginning of the period were utilized to fund net investing activities of $322.2 million. The Company's primary business objective is the origination and purchase of multi-family residential loans, commercial business loans and commercial real estate mortgage loans and to a lesser extent one-to-four family (including mixed-use properties) and SBA loans. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the net total of loan originations and purchases less loan repayments and sales was $442.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company also purchased $179.4 million in securities. During 2016, funds were provided by net increases of $312.3 million and $178.5 million in total deposits and short-term borrowed funds and $300.0 million in long-term borrowings. Additionally, funds were provided by $270.8 million in proceeds from maturities, sales, calls and prepayments of securities, $73.4 million from the issuance of subordinated debentures and $49.3 million in proceeds from the sale of buildings. The Company also used funds of $562.4 million, $19.7 million and $9.9 million for the repayment of long-term borrowed funds, dividend payments and purchases of treasury stock, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAt the time of the Bank's conversion from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank, the Bank was required by its primary regulator to establish a liquidation account which is reduced as and to the extent that eligible account holders reduce their qualifying deposits. Upon completion of the Merger, the liquidation account was assumed by the Bank. The balance of the liquidation account at December 31, 2016 was $0.7 million. In the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of the Bank, each eligible account holder will be entitled to receive a distribution from the liquidation account. The Bank is not permitted to declare or pay a dividend or to repurchase any of its capital stock if the effect would be to cause the Bank's regulatory capital to be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account but approval of the NYDFS Superintendent is required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years less prior dividends paid. Flushing Financial Corporation is subject to the same regulatory restrictions on the declaration of dividends as the Bank.\nRegulatory Capital Position. Under applicable regulatory capital regulations, the Bank and the Company are required to comply with each of four separate capital adequacy standards: leverage capital, common equity Tier I risk-based capital, Tier I risk-based capital and total risk-based capital. Such classifications are used by the FDIC and other bank regulatory agencies to determine matters ranging from each institution's quarterly FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments, to approvals of applications authorizing institutions to grow their asset size or otherwise expand business activities. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bank and the Company exceeded each of their four regulatory capital requirements. (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.)\n 72 \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's accounting policies are integral to understanding the results of operations and statement of financial condition. These policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Several of these policies require management's judgment to determine the value of the Company's assets and liabilities. The Company has established detailed written policies and control procedures to ensure consistent application of these policies. The Company has identified four accounting policies that require significant management valuation judgment: the allowance for loan losses, fair value of financial instruments, including other-than-temporary impairment assessment, goodwill impairment and income taxes.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. An allowance for loan losses is provided to absorb probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by reviewing all impaired loans on an individual basis. The remaining portfolio is evaluated based on the Company's historical loss experience, recent trends in losses, collection policies and collection experience, trends in the volume of non-performing loans, changes in the composition and volume of the gross loan portfolio, and local and national economic conditions. Judgment is required to determine how many years of historical loss experience are to be included when reviewing historical loss experience. A full credit cycle must be used, or loss estimates may be inaccurate. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available.\nNotwithstanding the judgment required in assessing the components of the allowance for loan losses, the Company believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The policy has been applied on a consistent basis for all periods presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. The Company carries certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value under the fair value option. Fair value is considered the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Management selected the fair value option for certain investment securities, primarily mortgage-backed securities, and certain borrowings. Changes in the fair value of financial instruments for which the fair value election is made are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income. At December 31, 2016, financial assets and financial liabilities with fair values of $30.4 million and $34.0 million, respectively, are carried at fair value under the fair value option.\nThe securities portfolio also consists of mortgage-backed and other securities for which the fair value election was not selected. These securities are classified as available for sale or held-to-maturity. Securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, with changes in fair value recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Securities held-to-maturity are carried at their amortized cost in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. If any decline in fair value for securities classified available for sale or held-to-maturity is deemed other-than-temporary, the security is written down to a new cost basis with the resulting loss recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2016 and 2015, no other-than-temporary impairment charges were recorded.\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities reported at fair value are required to be measured based on the following alternatives: (1) quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments (Level 1), (2) significant other observable inputs (Level 2), or (3) significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). Judgment is required in selecting the appropriate level to be used to determine fair value. The majority of financial assets and financial liabilities for which the fair value election was made, and the majority of investments classified as available for sale and held-to-maturity, were measured using Level 2 inputs, which require judgment to determine the fair value. The trust preferred securities held in the investment portfolio, and the Company's junior subordinated debentures, were measured using Level 3 inputs due to the inactive market for these securities.\nGoodwill Impairment. Goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite life and is tested for impairment, rather than amortized, on at least an annual basis. For the purpose of goodwill impairment testing, management has concluded that the Company has one reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, there is no impairment of goodwill. However, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, further evaluation is required to determine if a write down of goodwill is required.\n 73 \nQuoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are to be used as the basis for measurement, when available. Other acceptable valuation methods include an asset approach, which determines a fair value based upon the value of assets net of liabilities, an income approach, which determines fair value using one or more methods that convert anticipated economic benefits into a present single amount, and a market approach, which determines a fair value based on the similar businesses that have been sold.\nThe Company conducts its annual qualitative impairment testing of goodwill as of December 31. The impairment testing as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 did not show an impairment of goodwill based on the fair value of the Company.\nIncome Taxes. The Company estimates its income taxes payable based on the amounts it expects to owe to the various taxing authorizes (i.e. federal, state and local). In estimating income taxes, management assesses the relative merits and risks of the tax treatment of transactions, taking into account statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the Company's tax position. Management also relies on tax opinions, recent audits, and historical experience.\nThe Company also recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets that the Company estimates are more likely than not to be unrealizable, based on evidence available at the time the estimate is made. These estimates can be affected by changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates, and future income levels.\nContractual Obligations\n\nWe have significant obligations that arise in the normal course of business. We finance our assets with deposits and borrowings. We also use borrowings to manage our interest-rate risk. Borrowings with call provisions are included in the period of the next call date. We have the means to refinance these borrowings as they mature or are called through financing arrangements with the FHLB-NY and our ability to arrange repurchase agreements with broker-dealers and the FHLB-NY. (See Notes 8 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.)\nWe focus our balance sheet growth on the origination of mortgage loans. At December 31, 2016, we had commitments to extend credit and lines of credit of $322.7 million for mortgage and other loans. These loans will be funded through principal and interest payments received on existing mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, growth in customer deposits, and, when necessary, additional borrowings. (See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.)\nAt December 31, 2016, the Bank had 19 branches, which were all leased. The Bank leases its branch locations primarily when it is not the sole tenant. Whether the Bank will purchase its future branch locations will depend in part on the availability of suitable locations and the availability of properties. In addition, we lease our executive offices. We currently outsource our data processing, loan servicing and check processing functions. We believe that this is the most cost effective method for obtaining these services. These arrangements are usually volume dependent and have varying terms. The contracts for these services usually include annual increases based on the increase in the consumer price index. The amounts shown above for purchase obligations represent the current term and volume of activity of these contracts. We expect to renew these contracts as they expire.\n 74 \nThe amounts shown for pension and other postretirement benefits reflect our directors' pension plan and the supplemental retirement benefits of our president, and amounts due under our plan for medical and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The amount shown in the Less Than 1 Year\u201d column represents our current estimate for these benefits, some of which are based on information supplied by actuaries. The amounts shown in columns reflecting periods over one year represent our current estimate based on the past year's actual disbursements and information supplied by actuaries. The amounts do not include an increase for possible future retirees or increases in health plan costs. The amount shown in the More Than 5 Years\u201d column represents the amount required to increase the total amount to the projected benefit obligation of the directors' plan and the medical and life insurance benefit plans, since these are unfunded plans and the underfunded portion of the employee pension plan. (See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.)\nWe currently provide a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for officers who have achieved the designated level and completed one year of service. However, certain officers who have not reached the designated level but were already participants remain eligible to participate in the Plan. In addition to the amounts deferred by the officers, we match 50% of their contributions, generally up to a maximum of 5% of the officer's salary. These plans generally require the deferred balance to be credited with earnings at a rate earned by certain mutual funds. Through December 31, 2011, employees could not receive a distribution from these plans until their employment was terminated. The amounts shown in the columns for less than five years represent the estimate of the amounts we will contribute to a rabbi trust with respect to matching contributions under these plans. The amount shown in the More Than 5 Years\u201d column represents the current accrued liability for these plans, adjusted for the activity in the columns for less than five years. This expense is provided in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and the liability has been provided in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.", "item_7_tables": "Table 127: <table>

$64.9 million, a 40.5% increase over 2015, primarily due to higher net interest income and gains from the sale of buildings. \n\n- Net interest income increased by $12.7 million or 8.2% in 2016 compared to 2015, driven by balance sheet growth that outweighed a small decline in net interest margin.\n\n- There was no provision for loan losses in 2016 as credit quality improved. Non-performing loans declined from 2015.  \n\n- Non-interest income rose sharply by $41.8 million in 2016, mainly due to gains from the sale of three branch buildings.\n\n- Non-interest expenses were up $20.9 million, largely due to debt prepayment penalties, higher salaries and benefits costs, and other operating expenses. \n\n- Total assets grew 14.5% from 2015 to 2016. Loan growth funded by deposit growth and borrowed funds facilitated this asset growth.\n\n- The Company has adequate liquidity and is well capitalized under regulatory requirements.\n\n- Critical accounting policies that involve significant judgement include the allowance for loan losses, fair value measurements, goodwill impairment, and income taxes.\n\nIn summary, the Company improved profitability in 2016 through balance sheet expansion, supported by strong capital and liquidity."}
