MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nIntroduction and Certain Cautionary Statements\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial position of the Company together with its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.\nThe statements in this Annual Report may contain forward-looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated future financial performance, business prospects, legislative developments and similar matters. We note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results expressed in the forward looking statements such as intensified competition and/or operating problems in our operating business projects and their impact on revenues and profit margins or additional factors as described under Risk Factors\u201d above.\nWe are an internally managed BDC that is a leading national non-bank lender that provides, together with our controlled portfolio companies, a wide range of business and financial solutions under the Newtek\u00ae brand to the SMB market. Newtek's products and services include: Business Lending including SBA 7(a) loans, 504 loans and conventional loans, Electronic\nPayment Processing, Managed Technology Solutions (Cloud Computing), Technology Consulting, eCommerce, Accounts Receivable and Inventory Financing, personal and commercial lines Insurance Services, Web Services, Data Backup, Storage and Retrieval, and Payroll and Benefits Solutions to SMB accounts nationwide across all industries. We have an established and reliable platform that is not limited by client size, industry type or location. As a result, we believe we have a strong and diversified client base across every state in the U.S. and across a variety of different industries. In addition, we have developed a financial and technology based business model that enables us and our controlled portfolio companies to acquire and process our SMB clients in a cost effective manner. This capability is supported in large part by NewTracker\u00ae, our patented prospect management technology software which is similar to but we believe is better than the system popularized by Salesforce.com. We believe that this technology and low cost business model distinguishes us from our competitors.\nWe consolidate the following wholly-owned subsidiaries:\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Small Business Finance, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Asset Backed Securities, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCC Real Estate Holdings, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Whitestone Group, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Colorado Partners, LLC (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire DC Partners, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Holdings I, Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Louisiana BIDCO, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Louisiana Partners II, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Louisiana Partners III, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Louisiana Partners IV, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire New York Advisers II, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire New York Partners III, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire New York Partners IV, LLC (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire New York Partners V, LLC (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Partners, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exponential Business Development Co., Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Commercial Lending, Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek LSP Holdco, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NBSH Holdings, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Business Services Holdco 1, Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Business Services Holdco 2, Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Business Services Holdco 3, Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Business Services Holdco 4, Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Business Services Holdco 5, Inc.

In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with our 2015 tax year. As a BDC and a RIC, we are also subject to certain constraints, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code. As a result, previously consolidated subsidiaries are now recorded as investments in controlled portfolio companies, at fair value. NSBF is a consolidated subsidiary and originates loans under the SBA's 7(a) loan program.\nOur common shares are currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol NEWT\u201d.\nNSBF has been granted PLP status and originates, sells and services SBA 7(a) loans and is authorized to place SBA guarantees on loans without seeking prior SBA review and approval. Being a national lender, PLP status allows NSBF to expedite the origination of loans since NSBF is not required to present applications to the SBA for concurrent review and approval. The loss of PLP status could adversely impact our marketing efforts and ultimately our loan origination volume which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nAs a BDC, our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation primarily through loans originated by our business finance platform and our equity investments in certain portfolio companies that we control.\nWe target our debt investments, which are principally made through our business finance platform under the SBA 7(a) program, to produce a coupon rate of prime plus 2.75% which enables us to generate rapid sales of guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market. We typically structure our debt investments with the maximum seniority and collateral along with personal guarantees from portfolio company owners, in many cases collateralized by other assets including real estate. In most cases, our debt investment will be collateralized by a first lien on the assets of the portfolio company and a first or second lien on assets of guarantors, in both cases primarily real estate. All SBA loans are made with personal guarantees from any owner(s) of 20% or more of the portfolio company's equity. The amount of new debt investments, particularly SBA 7(a) loans that we originate, will directly impact future investment income. In addition, future amounts of unrealized appreciation or depreciation on our investments, as well as the amount of realized gains or losses, will also fluctuate depending upon economic conditions and the performance of our investment portfolio. The changes in realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation could have a material impact on our operating results. During 2018, sale prices for guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans were negatively impacted by market conditions, in particular a higher interest rate environment, which led to higher prepayments during the period, resulting in lower sale prices in the secondary market. A continuation or further reduction in the price of guaranteed SBA 7(a) loans could negatively impact our business.\nWe typically structure our debt investments to include non-financial covenants that seek to minimize our risk of capital loss such as lien protection and prohibitions against change of control. Our debt investments have strong protections, including default penalties, information rights and, in some cases, board observation rights and affirmative, negative and financial covenants. Debt investments in portfolio companies, including the controlled portfolio companies, have historically and are expected to continue to comprise the majority of our overall investments in number and dollar volume.\nWhile the vast majority of our investments have been structured as debt, we have in the past and expect in the future to make selective equity investments primarily as either strategic investments to enhance the integrated operating platform or, to a lesser degree, under the Capco programs. For investments in our controlled portfolio companies, we focus more on tailoring them to the long term growth needs of the companies than to return. Our objectives with these companies is to foster the development of the businesses as a part of the integrated operational platform of serving the SMB market, so we may reduce the burden on these companies to enable them to grow faster than they would otherwise and as another means of supporting their development.\nWe regularly engage in discussions with third parties with respect to various potential transactions. We may acquire an investment or a portfolio of investments or an entire company or sell a portion of our portfolio on an opportunistic basis. We, our subsidiaries, or our affiliates may also agree to manage certain other funds that invest in debt, equity or provide other financing or services to companies in a variety of industries for which we may earn management or other fees for our services. We may also invest in the equity of these funds, along with other third parties, from which we would seek to earn a return and/or future incentive allocations. Some of these transactions could be material to our business. Consummation of any such transaction will be subject to completion of due diligence, finalization of key business and financial terms (including price) and negotiation of final definitive documentation as well as a number of other factors and conditions including, without limitation, the approval of our board of directors and required regulatory or third-party consents and, in certain cases, the approval of our shareholders. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any such transaction would be consummated. Any of these transactions or funds may require significant management resources either during the transaction phase or on an ongoing basis depending on the terms of the transaction.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue in the form of interest, dividend, servicing and other fee income on debt and equity investments. Our debt investments typically have terms of 10 to 25 years and bear interest at prime plus a margin. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. We receive servicing income related to the guaranteed portions of SBA investments which we originate and sell into the\nsecondary market. These recurring fees are earned daily and recorded when earned. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of packaging, prepayment, legal and late fees. We record such fees related to loans as other income. Dividends are recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income is recorded at the time dividends are declared. Distributions of earnings from portfolio companies are evaluated to determine if the distribution is income, return of capital or capital gains.\nWe recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments and assets that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments or servicing assets, as appropriate, in the consolidated statements of operations.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses are salaries and benefits, interest expense and other general and administrative costs, such as professional fees, marketing, referral fees, servicing costs and rent. Since we are an internally-managed BDC with no outside adviser or management company, the BDC incurs all the related costs to operate the Company.\nGuarantees\nThe Company is a guarantor on the Sterling Receivable and Inventory Facility at NBC.

average outstanding performing portfolio of SBA non-affiliate investments increasing to $282,378,000 from $227,761,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, combined with an increase in the Prime Rate. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Prime Rate was increased three times, to 3.75%, effective January 2017, to 4.00%, effective April 2017 and to 4.25%, effective July 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018 the Prime Rate was increased three times, from 4.50% in January 2018 to 4.75%, effective April 2018, to 5.00% effective July 2018, and to 5.25% effective October 2018. The increase in the average outstanding performing portfolio resulted from the origination of new SBA non-affiliate investments during the year. We also recognized an additional $1,309,000 of interest income year over year from holding SBA guaranteed loans. Offsetting these increases was $1,493,000 of interest income related to accrued non-performing interest owed by two borrowers who paid their accrued interest balance in full in 2017.\nDividend Income\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Merchant Solutions, LLC\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premier Payments LLC\n</td> <td>2,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International Professional Marketing, Inc.\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(425\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SIDCO, LLC\n</td> <td>1,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mobil Money, LLC\n</td> <td>165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CDS Business Services, Inc.\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(200\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Secure CyberGateway, LLC\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United Capital Source, LLC\n</td> <td>275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMCAP Loan Holdings, LLC\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total dividend income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDividend income increased $2,883,000 year over year based on each portfolio company's financial results. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we earned $275,000 of dividend income from UCS, a wholly-owned controlled portfolio company that we invested in October 2017. See Note 3 for the discussion on the subsequent sale of UCS. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we earned an additional $600,000 of dividend income from IPM and SIDCO (combined as SIDCO was spun-off as a separate entity from IPM in July 2017), as a result of ownership for the full year. The increase in dividend income from NMS and Premier was a result increased profitability year over year, as well as an additional dividend paid by Premier in the fourth quarter of 2018 resulting from a portion of the gain recognized from the sale of one of its merchant portfolios. Dividend income is dependent on portfolio company earnings.

The portfolio earning servicing income increased $192,274,000 year over year. The increase was attributable to an increase in SBA 7(a) non-affiliate investments from 2017 to 2018.\nOther Income\nOther income relates primarily to legal, packaging, prepayment, and late fees earned from SBA 7(a) loans. The increase was related to an increase in legal and packaging fees earned as a result of the larger dollar volume of loans originated.\nExpenses: Table 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>16,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees\n</td> <td>3,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Origination and servicing\n</td> <td>8,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities\n</td> <td>(51\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(455\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>404\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>1,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other general and administrative costs\n</td> <td>6,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(372\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits increased $1,790,000 primarily due to an increase in headcount at NSBF.

The increase from Notes payable - Securitization trusts was the result of an additional securitization transaction completed in December 2017. We recognized $3,483,000 of interest expense attributable to the 2023 Notes, offset by the decrease in interest expense related the 2021 Notes of $2,446,000 as a result of our redemption of $40,250,000 of the 2021 Notes in March 2018 and issuance of $57,500,000 of 2023 Notes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we redeemed all $40,250,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes at 100% of their principal amount ($25 per Note), plus the accrued and unpaid interest thereon from December 31, 2017, through, but excluding, the Redemption Date. As a result, we recorded loss on extinguishment of debt of $1,059,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOrigination and Servicing\nThe increase in origination and servicing expenses was attributed to an increase in referral fees of $998,000 resulting from increased SBA 7(a) loan originations year over year, as well as a $1,493,000 increase in loan processing, liquidation and loan recovery expenses, all of which resulted from an increase in the outstanding loan portfolio period over period.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\nA portion of our investments in IPM and Mobil Money consisted of contingent consideration based on both entities attaining specific income levels for 2018 and 2017 with respect to our investment in IPM and 2018 and 2019 with respect to our investment in Mobil Money.

During the second half of 2018, sale prices for guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans were negatively impacted by market conditions, in particular a higher interest rate environment, which led to higher prepayments during the period resulting in lower sale prices in the secondary market. A continuation or further reduction in the price of guaranteed SBA 7(a) loans could negatively impact our business.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company originated a non-SBA, conventional loan for $5,700,000 which was sold for $5,978,000 resulting in a realized gain of $278,000.\nNet Realized Gains on SBA Non-Affiliate Investments\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td># of Debt Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td># of Debt Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Amount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA non-affiliate investments originated\n</td> <td>569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>469,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>385,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA guaranteed non-affiliate investments sold\n</td> <td>563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>360,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>283,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains recognized on sale of SBA guaranteed non-affiliate investments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average sale price as a percent of principal balance (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110.52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Realized gains greater than 110.00% must be split 50/50 with the SBA in accordance with SBA regulations.

NTS expects to incur additional costs associated with the continued cyber security remediation.\nThe increase of $3,000,000 at NBL and corresponding decrease of $3,000,000 at NBC during the year ended December 31, 2018 was a result of NBC's SBA 504 lending program being conducted by NBL. NBL's business will focus on SBA 504 and construction lending, while NBC focuses on accounts receivable and inventory financing.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we contributed $381,000 and $135,000 to PMT and NIA, respectively, for working capital needs. Based on PMT's and NIA's inability to generate sufficient cash flows and their continued losses, we recognized unrealized depreciation of $381,000 and $420,000 for the year.\nWe recognized $4,939,000 in unrealized depreciation on our investment in BSP during the year ended December 31, 2018, which includes $1,509,000 in capital contributions which increased the cost basis of our investment in BSP. The valuation change for the year ended December 31, 2018, was the result of several quantitative and qualitative factors. On a quantitative basis, BSP's financial performance has declined since we made our initial investment in BSP in 2016, and BSP has since lost customers, materially impacting its business. Second, as previously disclosed, on October 12, 2017, the FBI executed a search warrant at BSP's office in Westfield, Indiana. In addition, Kerri Agee, the former owner and President of BSP, was terminated in April 2018. As a result of the foregoing factors which have impacted BSP's ability to retain customers, BSP has assigned a significant number of its customer servicing agreements to SBL, as well as transferred remaining employees of BSP to SBL to continue to service those customers. As such, BSP was determined to have a fair value of zero as of December 31, 2018 and SBL's value increased due to the additional cash flows from the assigned third-party servicing accounts.\nProvision for Deferred Taxes on Net Unrealized Appreciation of Investments\nCertain consolidated subsidiaries of ours are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes.

In April 2016, the Company moved its headquarters to Lake Success, New York. As a result, the Company vacated its spaces in West Hempstead, New York and New York, New York. The Company recorded a loss of $604,000 related to the remaining liabilities under the West Hempstead lease, offset by future rental income, during the year ended December 31, 2016. No such expense was incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company has sublet both spaces. This decrease was offset by $1,397,000 of bad debt expense related to amounts owed from related parties, primarily PMT and BSP, which we determined to be uncollectible and an increase in referral fees of $485,000 related to the increase in loan originations year over year.\nNet Realized Gains and Net Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation\nNet realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the cost basis of our investments without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized and includes investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments reflects the change in portfolio investment fair values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.\nNet Realized Gains on SBA Non-Affiliate Investments\nNet realized gains from SBA non-affiliate investments for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $39,617,000 and $31,512,000, respectively, which includes realized losses of $894,000 and $925,000 during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td># of Debt Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td># of Debt Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Amount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA non-affiliate investments originated\n</td> <td>480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>385,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA guaranteed non-affiliate investments sold\n</td> <td>458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>283,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains recognized on sale of SBA guaranteed non-affiliate investments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average sale price as a percent of principal balance (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111.91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Realized gains greater than 110.00% must be split 50/50 with the SBA in accordance with SBA regulations.

Unrealized appreciation related to our investment in NBC was related to growth in its SBA 504 lending program and growth in its accounts receivable and inventory financing programs.\nUnrealized depreciation related to our investment in NTS was related to weak financial performance. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we made an additional $1,000,000 debt investment in NPS. Due to NPS' continued negative cash flows, we recorded an unrealized loss of $3,045,000 on our total investment in NPS, which consisted of an $860,000 equity investment and $2,185,000 of debt investments, including a $1,000,000 investment made in NPS in 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a $2,000,000 unrealized loss on its investment in BSP to reflect the potential impact to the business and tradename as a result of the FBI investigation discussed in Note 9.\nProvision for Deferred Taxes on Net Unrealized Appreciation of Investments\nCertain consolidated subsidiaries of ours are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. These taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes, but are consolidated for GAAP purposes, and may generate income tax liabilities or assets from temporary differences in the recognition of items for financial reporting and income tax purposes at the subsidiaries. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized a provision for deferred taxes of $2,179,000 and $5,128,000, respectively, related to the net unrealized appreciation of controlled portfolio company investments.\nNet Unrealized Depreciation on Servicing Assets\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized depreciation on servicing assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,394\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,269\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,125\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in unrealized depreciation on servicing assets is primarily related to the increase in the discount rate from 12.20% to 13.06% and an increase in the cumulative prepayment rate from 18.50% to 20.00%.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived from our Capital One Facility, Notes payable - related parties, 2022 Notes, 2023 Notes, securitization transactions and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our borrowings and the proceeds from the turnover of our portfolio and from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives. We may raise additional equity or debt capital through both registered offerings off a shelf registration, including At-The-Market\u201d, or ATM, and private offerings of securities. As of December 31, 2018, our asset coverage was 185%. See Regulation.\u201d\nPublic Offerings\nATM Program\nThe ATM Equity Distribution Agreement provides that we may offer and sell up to 4,400,000 shares of common stock from time to time through the Placement Agents.

The facility was amended again in June 2018 and the portion of the facility collateralized by the government guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans, was reduced to Prime minus 0.75% (previously Prime minus 0.25%). The interest rate on the portion of the facility, collateralized by the non-guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans, was reduced to Prime plus 0.25% (previously Prime plus 0.75%). The facility provides for a 55% advance rate on the non-guaranteed portions of the SBA 7(a) loans NSBF originates, and a 90% advance rate on the guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans NSBF originates. In addition, the amendment extended the date on which the facility will convert to a term loan from May 16, 2017 to May 11, 2020 and extended the maturity date of the facility to May 11, 2022.\nAt December 31, 2018, there was $34,700,000 outstanding under the guaranteed line of credit. No amounts were outstanding under the unguaranteed line of credit. At December 31, 2018 NSBF was in full compliance with all applicable loan covenants.\nNotes Payable - Related Parties\nIn June 2015, the Company entered into a Related Party RLOC with certain controlled portfolio companies. Maximum borrowings under the Related Party RLOC were $38,000,000.\nIn June 2017, the Related Party RLOC was amended to increase maximum borrowings to $50,000,000. The outstanding balance had an interest rate equal to LIBOR (with a floor of 0.50%) plus 6% or at a rate equal to the greater of the Prime Rate or 3.5% plus 5.0%. In November 2018, the Related Party RLOC was amended to reduce the interest rate to the lesser LIBOR plus 2.5% or the Prime Rate plus 1.5%.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Related Party RLOC interest rate was 4.84%. The Related Party RLOC has a maturity date of November 8, 2023. Outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2018 were $16,840,000.\nSecuritization Transactions\nSince 2010, NSBF has engaged in securitizations of the unguaranteed portions of its SBA 7(a) loans. In the securitization, it uses a special purpose entity (the Trust\u201d) which is considered a variable interest entity. Applying the consolidation requirements for VIEs under the accounting rules in ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, and ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, which became effective January 1, 2010, the Company determined that as the primary beneficiary of the securitization vehicle, based on its power to direct activities through its role as servicer for the Trust and its obligation to absorb losses and right to receive benefits, it needed to consolidate the Trusts. NSBF therefore consolidated the entity using the carrying amounts of the Trust's assets and liabilities. NSBF reflects the assets in SBA Unguaranteed Non-Affiliate Investments and reflects the associated financing in Notes Payable - Securitization Trusts.\nIn November 2016, NSBF completed its seventh securitization which resulted in the transfer of $56,073,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2016-1 Trust. The 2016-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $53,444,000, consisting of $43,632,000 Class A notes and $9,812,000 of Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB+\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is February 2042.\nIn December 2017, NSBF completed its eighth securitization which resulted in the transfer of $76,188,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2017-1 Trust. The 2017-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $75,426,000, consisting of $58,111,000 Class A notes and $17,315,000 of Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB-\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is February 2043.\nIn October 2018, the 2013-1 Trust was terminated as a result of NSBF purchasing the 2013-1 Trust assets, with the 2013-1 Trust's noteholders receiving the redemption price. Certain of the 2013-1 Trust's assets were subsequently transferred to the 2018-1 Trust.\nIn November 2018, NSBF completed its ninth securitization which resulted in the transfer of $108,551,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2018-1 Trust. The 2018-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $108,551,000, consisting of $82,876,000 Class A notes and $25,675,000 of Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB-\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is February 2044.\nShare Repurchase Plan\nOn December 17, 2018, the Company announced that its Board approved a new share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to 300,000 of the Company's outstanding common shares on the open market.\nOn May 11, 2016, the Company announced that its Board approved a share repurchase program under which the Company could repurchase up to 150,000 of the Company's outstanding common shares on the open market.

At December 31, 2018, the Company determined that it is not probable that payments would be required to be made under the guarantee.\nNo amounts related to the guarantees discussed above are included in the calculation of our asset coverage ratio at December 31, 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe value investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations. However, a readily available market value is not expected to exist for many of the investments in our portfolio, and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board under our valuation policy and process. We may seek pricing information with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value such investments. We\nalso employ independent third-party valuation firms for certain of our investments for which there is not a readily available market value.\nThe application of our valuation methods may include comparisons of the portfolio companies to peer companies that are public, the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings, discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private equity valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from values that may ultimately be received or settled.\nOur Board is ultimately and solely responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value of investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels for disclosure purposes. The Company carries all investments at fair value. Additionally, the Company carries its credits in lieu of cash, notes payable in credits in lieu of cash, and servicing assets at fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority (Level 1) to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and gives the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). An asset or liability's classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of the significant input to its valuation. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury, other U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter markets.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes certain U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities, corporate debt securities, derivative contracts and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. This category generally includes certain private equity investments, retained residual interests in securitizations, residential mortgage servicing rights, and highly structured or long-term derivative contracts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nValuation of Investments\nLevel 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of the Board to assist in the valuation of certain portfolio investments without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process.\nWhen determining fair value of Level 3 debt and equity investments, the Company may take into account the following factors, where relevant: the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio\ncompany's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded securities, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made and other relevant factors. The primary method for determining enterprise value uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's EBITDA or revenue. The enterprise value analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if debt investments are credit impaired. If debt investments are credit impaired, the Company will use the enterprise value analysis or a liquidation basis analysis to determine fair value. For debt investments that are not determined to be credit impaired, the Company uses a market interest rate yield analysis to determine fair value.\nIn addition, for certain debt investments, the Company may base its valuation on quotes provided by an independent third-party broker.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If the Company were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, the Company may realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded.\nThe Company's investments are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments are traded.\nChanges in the market environment, portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. We determine the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Our investment portfolio is carried on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities at fair value with any adjustments to fair value recognized as \"Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation)\" on the consolidated statements of operations until the investment is realized, usually upon exit, resulting in any gain or loss being recognized as a \"Net realized gains (losses).\"\nOur Board has the final responsibility for overseeing, reviewing and approving, in good faith, our determination of the fair value for our investment portfolio and our valuation procedures, consistent with 1940 Act requirements. We believe our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 approximates fair value as of those dates based on the markets in which we operate and other conditions in existence on those reporting dates.\nIncome Recognition\nInterest on loan investments is accrued and included in income based on contractual rates applied to principal amounts outstanding. Interest income is determined using a method that results in a level rate of return on principal amounts outstanding. When a loan becomes 90 days or more past due, or if we otherwise do not expect to receive interest and principal repayments, the loan is placed on non-accrual status and the recognition of interest income is discontinued. Interest payments received on loans that are on non-accrual status are treated as reductions of principal until the principal is repaid.\nWe receive servicing income related to the guaranteed portions of SBA loan investments which we sell into the secondary market. These recurring fees are earned daily and recorded when earned. Servicing income is earned for the full term of the loan or until the loan is repaid.\nWe receive a variety of fees from borrowers in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including packaging fees, legal fees, late fees and prepayment fees. All other income is recorded when earned.\nDividend income is recorded at the time dividends are declared. Distributions of earnings from portfolio companies are evaluated to determine if the distribution is income, return of capital or realized gain.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax\nassets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Company's U.S. federal and state income tax returns prior to fiscal year 2014 are generally closed, and management continually evaluates expiring statutes of limitations, audits, proposed settlements, changes in tax law and new authoritative rulings.\nThe Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with the 2015 tax year and operates in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. The RIC tax return includes Newtek Business Services Corp. and NSBF, a single member LLC disregarded for tax purposes. None of the Company's other subsidiaries are included in the RIC tax return. The Company will evaluate and record any deferred tax assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries that are not included in the RIC tax return. In order to maintain its RIC tax treatment, among other things, the Company is required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each tax year. The Company intends to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal income taxes with respect to any income that is distributed to its stockholders as dividends.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions, and would distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. The Company would then pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, no U.S. federal excise taxes were due.\nThe Company's Taxable Subsidiaries accrue income taxes payable based on the applicable corporate rates on the net unrealized appreciation generated by the controlled investments held by the Taxable Subsidiaries. Such deferred tax liabilities amounted to $9,241,000 and $8,164,000 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are recorded as a deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. The change in deferred tax liabilities is included as a component of net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force),\u201d which requires that the statement of cash flow explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this standard with respect to its statement of cash flows.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition\u201d, and most industry-specific guidance\nthroughout the Industry Topics of the ASC. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under the new guidance, an entity is required to perform the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The new guidance will significantly enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures as to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)\u201d, which clarified the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing\u201d, which clarified the implementation guidance regarding performance obligations and licensing arrangements. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)-Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients\u201d, which clarified guidance on assessing collectability, presenting sales tax, measuring noncash consideration, and certain transition matters. In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-20, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)-Technical Corrections and Improvements\u201d, which provided disclosure relief, and clarified the scope and application of the new revenue standard and related cost guidance. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim\nperiods within that reporting period. The Company has evaluated the guidance under Topic 606 and has identified similar performance obligations under ASC 606 as compared with deliverables and separate units of account previously identified. The Company adopted this standard with respect to its revenue recognition. The Company evaluated each revenue stream and concluded that all were covered by the scope exceptions as detailed in Topic 606. As a result, the Company determined that the timing of its revenue recognition will remain the same.\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)\u201d, which is intended to improve fair value and defined benefit disclosure requirements by removing disclosures that are not cost-beneficial, clarifying disclosures' specific requirements, and adding relevant disclosure requirements. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases,\u201d which amends various aspects of existing accounting guidance for leases, including the recognition of a right of use asset and a lease liability for leases with a duration of greater than one year. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements\u201d, which now allows entities the option of recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption while continuing to present all prior periods under previous lease accounting guidance. The Company has completed its review of the new guidance and estimates that approximately $8,900,000 and $10,900,000 would be recognized as total right-of-use assets and total lease liabilities, respectively. After the reversal of previously recorded deferred rent and lease incentive liabilities, the Company estimates the net impact to the Company's net assets to be an increase of approximately $119,000.\nSubsequent Events\nDividend Declaration\nOn February 15, 2019, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share payable on March 29, 2019 to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2019. The dividend will be paid in cash or shares of the Company's common stock through participation in the Company's DRIP, at the election of shareholders.\nSecuritization Activity\nOn February 25, 2019, the 2010-1 Trust was terminated as a result of NSBF purchasing the 2010-1 Trust assets, with the 2010-1 Trust's noteholders receiving the redemption price.\nCommon Stock\nFrom January 1, 2019 through March 15, 2019 the Company sold 134,658 shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $18.89 per share under the ATM Equity Distribution Agreement. Proceeds, net of offering costs and expenses were $2,544,000. As of March 15, 2019, there were 2,834,929 shares of common stock available for sale under the ATM Equity Distribution Agreement.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe impact of inflation and changing prices on our results of operations is not material.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nIntroduction and Certain Cautionary Statements\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial position of the Company together with its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.\nThe statements in this Annual Report may contain forward-looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated future financial performance, business prospects, legislative developments and similar matters. We note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results expressed in the forward looking statements such as intensified competition and/or operating problems in our operating business projects and their impact on revenues and profit margins or additional factors as described under Risk Factors\u201d above.\nWe are an internally managed BDC that is a leading national non-bank lender that provides, together with our controlled portfolio companies, a wide range of business and financial solutions under the Newtek\u00ae brand to the SMB market.

In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with our 2015 tax year. As a BDC and a RIC, we are also subject to certain constraints, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code. As a result, previously consolidated subsidiaries are now recorded as investments in controlled portfolio companies, at fair value. NSBF is a consolidated subsidiary and originates loans under the SBA's 7(a) loan program.\nOur common shares are currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol NEWT\u201d.\nNSBF has been granted PLP status and originates, sells and services SBA 7(a) loans and is authorized to place SBA guarantees on loans without seeking prior SBA review and approval. Being a national lender, PLP status allows NSBF to expedite the origination of loans since NSBF is not required to present applications to the SBA for concurrent review and approval. The loss of PLP status could adversely impact our marketing efforts and ultimately our loan origination volume which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nAs a BDC, our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation primarily through loans originated by our business finance platform and our equity investments in certain portfolio companies that we control.\nWe target our debt investments, which are principally made through our business finance platform under the SBA 7(a) program, to produce a coupon rate of prime plus 2.75% which enables us to generate rapid sales of guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market. We typically structure our debt investments with the maximum seniority and collateral along with personal guarantees from portfolio company owners, in many cases collateralized by other assets including real estate. In most cases, our debt investment will be collateralized by a first lien on the assets of the portfolio company and a first or second lien on assets of guarantors, in both cases primarily real estate. All SBA loans are made with personal guarantees from any owner(s) of 20% or more of the portfolio company's equity. The amount of new debt investments, particularly SBA 7(a) loans that we originate, will directly impact future investment income. In addition, future amounts of unrealized appreciation or depreciation on our investments, as well as the amount of realized gains or losses, will also fluctuate depending upon economic conditions and the performance of our investment portfolio. The changes in realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation could have a material impact on our operating results. During 2018, sale prices for guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans were negatively impacted by market conditions, in particular a higher interest rate environment, which led to higher prepayments during the period, resulting in lower sale prices in the secondary market. A continuation or further reduction in the price of guaranteed SBA 7(a) loans could negatively impact our business.\nWe typically structure our debt investments to include non-financial covenants that seek to minimize our risk of capital loss such as lien protection and prohibitions against change of control. Our debt investments have strong protections, including default penalties, information rights and, in some cases, board observation rights and affirmative, negative and financial covenants. Debt investments in portfolio companies, including the controlled portfolio companies, have historically and are expected to continue to comprise the majority of our overall investments in number and dollar volume.\nWhile the vast majority of our investments have been structured as debt, we have in the past and expect in the future to make selective equity investments primarily as either strategic investments to enhance the integrated operating platform or, to a lesser degree, under the Capco programs. For investments in our controlled portfolio companies, we focus more on tailoring them to the long term growth needs of the companies than to return. Our objectives with these companies is to foster the development of the businesses as a part of the integrated operational platform of serving the SMB market, so we may reduce the burden on these companies to enable them to grow faster than they would otherwise and as another means of supporting their development.\nWe regularly engage in discussions with third parties with respect to various potential transactions. We may acquire an investment or a portfolio of investments or an entire company or sell a portion of our portfolio on an opportunistic basis. We, our subsidiaries, or our affiliates may also agree to manage certain other funds that invest in debt, equity or provide other financing or services to companies in a variety of industries for which we may earn management or other fees for our services. We may also invest in the equity of these funds, along with other third parties, from which we would seek to earn a return and/or future incentive allocations. Some of these transactions could be material to our business. Consummation of any such transaction will be subject to completion of due diligence, finalization of key business and financial terms (including price) and negotiation of final definitive documentation as well as a number of other factors and conditions including, without limitation, the approval of our board of directors and required regulatory or third-party consents and, in certain cases, the approval of our shareholders. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any such transaction would be consummated. Any of these transactions or funds may require significant management resources either during the transaction phase or on an ongoing basis depending on the terms of the transaction.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue in the form of interest, dividend, servicing and other fee income on debt and equity investments. Our debt investments typically have terms of 10 to 25 years and bear interest at prime plus a margin. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. We receive servicing income related to the guaranteed portions of SBA investments which we originate and sell into the\nsecondary market. These recurring fees are earned daily and recorded when earned. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of packaging, prepayment, legal and late fees. We record such fees related to loans as other income. Dividends are recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income is recorded at the time dividends are declared. Distributions of earnings from portfolio companies are evaluated to determine if the distribution is income, return of capital or capital gains.\nWe recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments and assets that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments or servicing assets, as appropriate, in the consolidated statements of operations.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses are salaries and benefits, interest expense and other general and administrative costs, such as professional fees, marketing, referral fees, servicing costs and rent. Since we are an internally-managed BDC with no outside adviser or management company, the BDC incurs all the related costs to operate the Company.\nGuarantees\nThe Company is a guarantor on the Sterling Receivable and Inventory Facility at NBC.

increase in the Prime Rate. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Prime Rate was increased three times, to 3.75%, effective January 2017, to 4.00%, effective April 2017 and to 4.25%, effective July 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018 the Prime Rate was increased three times, from 4.50% in January 2018 to 4.75%, effective April 2018, to 5.00% effective July 2018, and to 5.25% effective October 2018. The increase in the average outstanding performing portfolio resulted from the origination of new SBA non-affiliate investments during the year. We also recognized an additional $1,309,000 of interest income year over year from holding SBA guaranteed loans. Offsetting these increases was $1,493,000 of interest income related to accrued non-performing interest owed by two borrowers who paid their accrued interest balance in full in 2017.\nDividend Income\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Merchant Solutions, LLC\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premier Payments LLC\n</td> <td>2,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International Professional Marketing, Inc.\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(425\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SIDCO, LLC\n</td> <td>1,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mobil Money, LLC\n</td> <td>165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CDS Business Services, Inc.\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(200\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Secure CyberGateway, LLC\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United Capital Source, LLC\n</td> <td>275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMCAP Loan Holdings, LLC\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total dividend income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDividend income increased $2,883,000 year over year based on each portfolio company's financial results. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we earned $275,000 of dividend income from UCS, a wholly-owned controlled portfolio company that we invested in October 2017. See Note 3 for the discussion on the subsequent sale of UCS. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we earned an additional $600,000 of dividend income from IPM and SIDCO (combined as SIDCO was spun-off as a separate entity from IPM in July 2017), as a result of ownership for the full year. The increase in dividend income from NMS and Premier was a result increased profitability year over year, as well as an additional dividend paid by Premier in the fourth quarter of 2018 resulting from a portion of the gain recognized from the sale of one of its merchant portfolios. Dividend income is dependent on portfolio company earnings.

The portfolio earning servicing income increased $192,274,000 year over year. The increase was attributable to an increase in SBA 7(a) non-affiliate investments from 2017 to 2018.\nOther Income\nOther income relates primarily to legal, packaging, prepayment, and late fees earned from SBA 7(a) loans. The increase was related to an increase in legal and packaging fees earned as a result of the larger dollar volume of loans originated.\nExpenses: Table 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>16,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees\n</td> <td>3,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Origination and servicing\n</td> <td>8,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities\n</td> <td>(51\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(455\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>404\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>1,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other general and administrative costs\n</td> <td>6,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(372\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits increased $1,790,000 primarily due to an increase in headcount at NSBF.

The increase from Notes payable - Securitization trusts was the result of an additional securitization transaction completed in December 2017. We recognized $3,483,000 of interest expense attributable to the 2023 Notes, offset by the decrease in interest expense related the 2021 Notes of $2,446,000 as a result of our redemption of $40,250,000 of the 2021 Notes in March 2018 and issuance of $57,500,000 of 2023 Notes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we redeemed all $40,250,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes at 100% of their principal amount ($25 per Note), plus the accrued and unpaid interest thereon from December 31, 2017, through, but excluding, the Redemption Date. As a result, we recorded loss on extinguishment of debt of $1,059,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOrigination and Servicing\nThe increase in origination and servicing expenses was attributed to an increase in referral fees of $998,000 resulting from increased SBA 7(a) loan originations year over year, as well as a $1,493,000 increase in loan processing, liquidation and loan recovery expenses, all of which resulted from an increase in the outstanding loan portfolio period over period.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\nA portion of our investments in IPM and Mobil Money consisted of contingent consideration based on both entities attaining specific income levels for 2018 and 2017 with respect to our investment in IPM and 2018 and 2019 with respect to our investment in Mobil Money. As a result, we decreased the contingent consideration liability by $51,000 and $455,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nNet Realized Gains and Net Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation\nNet realized gains from SBA non-affiliate investments for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $42,845,000 and $39,617,000, respectively, which includes realized losses on SBA non-affiliate investments of $2,738,000 and $894,000 during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the second half of 2018, sale prices for guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans were negatively impacted by market conditions, in particular a higher interest rate environment, which led to higher prepayments during the period resulting in lower sale prices in the secondary market. A continuation or further reduction in the price of guaranteed SBA 7(a) loans could negatively impact our business.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company originated a non-SBA, conventional loan for $5,700,000 which was sold for $5,978,000 resulting in a realized gain of $278,000.\nNet Realized Gains on SBA Non-Affiliate Investments\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td># of Debt Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td># of Debt Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Amount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA non-affiliate investments originated\n</td> <td>569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>469,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>385,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA guaranteed non-affiliate investments sold\n</td> <td>563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>360,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>283,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains recognized on sale of SBA guaranteed non-affiliate investments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average sale price as a percent of principal balance (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110.52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Realized gains greater than 110.00% must be split 50/50 with the SBA in accordance with SBA regulations.

NTS expects to incur additional costs associated with the continued cyber security remediation.\nThe increase of $3,000,000 at NBL and corresponding decrease of $3,000,000 at NBC during the year ended December 31, 2018 was a result of NBC's SBA 504 lending program being conducted by NBL. NBL's business will focus on SBA 504 and construction lending, while NBC focuses on accounts receivable and inventory financing.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we contributed $381,000 and $135,000 to PMT and NIA, respectively, for working capital needs. Based on PMT's and NIA's inability to generate sufficient cash flows and their continued losses, we recognized unrealized depreciation of $381,000 and $420,000 for the year.\nWe recognized $4,939,000 in unrealized depreciation on our investment in BSP during the year ended December 31, 2018, which includes $1,509,000 in capital contributions which increased the cost basis of our investment in BSP. The valuation change for the year ended December 31, 2018, was the result of several quantitative and qualitative factors. On a quantitative basis, BSP's financial performance has declined since we made our initial investment in BSP in 2016, and BSP has since lost customers, materially impacting its business. Second, as previously disclosed, on October 12, 2017, the FBI executed a search warrant at BSP's office in Westfield, Indiana. In addition, Kerri Agee, the former owner and President of BSP, was terminated in April 2018. As a result of the foregoing factors which have impacted BSP's ability to retain customers, BSP has assigned a significant number of its customer servicing agreements to SBL, as well as transferred remaining employees of BSP to SBL to continue to service those customers. As such, BSP was determined to have a fair value of zero as of December 31, 2018 and SBL's value increased due to the additional cash flows from the assigned third-party servicing accounts.\nProvision for Deferred Taxes on Net Unrealized Appreciation of Investments\nCertain consolidated subsidiaries of ours are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. These taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes, but are consolidated for GAAP purposes, and may generate income tax liabilities or assets from temporary differences in the recognition of items for financial reporting and income tax purposes at the subsidiaries. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized a provision for deferred taxes of\n$1,077,000 and $2,179,000, respectively, related to the net unrealized appreciation of controlled portfolio company investments.\nNet Unrealized Depreciation on Servicing Assets\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized depreciation on servicing assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,685\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,394\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,291\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in unrealized depreciation on servicing assets is primarily related to the increase in the discount rate from 12.20% to 14.24%, coupled with an increase in the cumulative prepayment rate from 18.50% to 26.00%.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nInvestment Income Table 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend income\n</td> <td>9,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(826\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Servicing income\n</td> <td>7,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>3,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>576\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Income\nThe increase in interest income was attributable to the average outstanding performing portfolio of SBA non-affiliate investments increasing to $227,761,000 from $176,210,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, combined with an increase in the Prime Rate.

The increase in salaries and benefits was also related to a $386,000 increase in stock-based compensation expense year over year.\nInterest Expense\nThe following is a summary of interest expense by facility for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable - Securitization Trusts\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank notes payable\n</td> <td>1,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes due 2022\n</td> <td>707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes due 2021\n</td> <td>3,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>983\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable - related parties\n</td> <td>780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>520\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in interest expense year over year is primarily related to interest from the Notes payable - Securitization trusts, 2021 Notes and Notes payable - related parties. The increase from Notes payable - Securitization trusts was the result of an additional securitization transaction completed in November 2016 and December 2017. In April 2016, we issued $40,250,000 of 2021 Notes bearing interest at 7.00%. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred a full year of interest expense as compared to a partial year of interest expense in 2016. The increase from Notes payable - related parties was related to the increase in the average outstanding balance year over year.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\nA portion of our investment in IPM consisted of contingent consideration based on IPM attaining specific EBITDA levels for 2017 and 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we reduced the contingent consideration liability by $455,000 based on the probability of IPM attaining specific EBITDA levels for 2017 and 2018.\nOther General and Administrative Costs\nOther general and administrative costs include managed IT services, marketing, rent and other costs. In April 2016, the Company moved its headquarters to Lake Success, New York. As a result, the Company vacated its spaces in West Hempstead, New York and New York, New York. The Company recorded a loss of $604,000 related to the remaining liabilities under the West Hempstead lease, offset by future rental income, during the year ended December 31, 2016. No such expense was incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company has sublet both spaces. This decrease was offset by $1,397,000 of bad debt expense related to amounts owed from related parties, primarily PMT and BSP, which we determined to be uncollectible and an increase in referral fees of $485,000 related to the increase in loan originations year over year.\nNet Realized Gains and Net Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation\nNet realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the cost basis of our investments without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized and includes investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments reflects the change in portfolio investment fair values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.\nNet Realized Gains on SBA Non-Affiliate Investments\nNet realized gains from SBA non-affiliate investments for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $39,617,000 and $31,512,000, respectively, which includes realized losses of $894,000 and $925,000 during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td># of Debt Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td># of Debt Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Amount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA non-affiliate investments originated\n</td> <td>480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>385,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA guaranteed non-affiliate investments sold\n</td> <td>458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>283,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains recognized on sale of SBA guaranteed non-affiliate investments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average sale price as a percent of principal balance (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111.91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Realized gains greater than 110.00% must be split 50/50 with the SBA in accordance with SBA regulations.

Unrealized appreciation related to our investment in NBC was related to growth in its SBA 504 lending program and growth in its accounts receivable and inventory financing programs.\nUnrealized depreciation related to our investment in NTS was related to weak financial performance. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we made an additional $1,000,000 debt investment in NPS. Due to NPS' continued negative cash flows, we recorded an unrealized loss of $3,045,000 on our total investment in NPS, which consisted of an $860,000 equity investment and $2,185,000 of debt investments, including a $1,000,000 investment made in NPS in 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a $2,000,000 unrealized loss on its investment in BSP to reflect the potential impact to the business and tradename as a result of the FBI investigation discussed in Note 9.\nProvision for Deferred Taxes on Net Unrealized Appreciation of Investments\nCertain consolidated subsidiaries of ours are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. These taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes, but are consolidated for GAAP purposes, and may generate income tax liabilities or assets from temporary differences in the recognition of items for financial reporting and income tax purposes at the subsidiaries.

The facility was amended again in June 2018 and the portion of the facility collateralized by the government guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans, was reduced to Prime minus 0.75% (previously Prime minus 0.25%). The interest rate on the portion of the facility, collateralized by the non-guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans, was reduced to Prime plus 0.25% (previously Prime plus 0.75%). The facility provides for a 55% advance rate on the non-guaranteed portions of the SBA 7(a) loans NSBF originates, and a 90% advance rate on the guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans NSBF originates. In addition, the amendment extended the date on which the facility will convert to a term loan from May 16, 2017 to May 11, 2020 and extended the maturity date of the facility to May 11, 2022.\nAt December 31, 2018, there was $34,700,000 outstanding under the guaranteed line of credit. No amounts were outstanding under the unguaranteed line of credit. At December 31, 2018 NSBF was in full compliance with all applicable loan covenants.\nNotes Payable - Related Parties\nIn June 2015, the Company entered into a Related Party RLOC with certain controlled portfolio companies. Maximum borrowings under the Related Party RLOC were $38,000,000.\nIn June 2017, the Related Party RLOC was amended to increase maximum borrowings to $50,000,000. The outstanding balance had an interest rate equal to LIBOR (with a floor of 0.50%) plus 6% or at a rate equal to the greater of the Prime Rate or 3.5% plus 5.0%. In November 2018, the Related Party RLOC was amended to reduce the interest rate to the lesser LIBOR plus 2.5% or the Prime Rate plus 1.5%.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Related Party RLOC interest rate was 4.84%. The Related Party RLOC has a maturity date of November 8, 2023. Outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2018 were $16,840,000.\nSecuritization Transactions\nSince 2010, NSBF has engaged in securitizations of the unguaranteed portions of its SBA 7(a) loans. In the securitization, it uses a special purpose entity (the Trust\u201d) which is considered a variable interest entity. Applying the consolidation requirements for VIEs under the accounting rules in ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, and ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, which became effective January 1, 2010, the Company determined that as the primary beneficiary of the securitization vehicle, based on its power to direct activities through its role as servicer for the Trust and its obligation to absorb losses and right to receive benefits, it needed to consolidate the Trusts. NSBF therefore consolidated the entity using the carrying amounts of the Trust's assets and liabilities. NSBF reflects the assets in SBA Unguaranteed Non-Affiliate Investments and reflects the associated financing in Notes Payable - Securitization Trusts.\nIn November 2016, NSBF completed its seventh securitization which resulted in the transfer of $56,073,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2016-1 Trust. The 2016-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $53,444,000, consisting of $43,632,000 Class A notes and $9,812,000 of Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB+\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is February 2042.\nIn December 2017, NSBF completed its eighth securitization which resulted in the transfer of $76,188,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2017-1 Trust. The 2017-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $75,426,000, consisting of $58,111,000 Class A notes and $17,315,000 of Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB-\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is February 2043.\nIn October 2018, the 2013-1 Trust was terminated as a result of NSBF purchasing the 2013-1 Trust assets, with the 2013-1 Trust's noteholders receiving the redemption price. Certain of the 2013-1 Trust's assets were subsequently transferred to the 2018-1 Trust.\nIn November 2018, NSBF completed its ninth securitization which resulted in the transfer of $108,551,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2018-1 Trust. The 2018-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $108,551,000, consisting of $82,876,000 Class A notes and $25,675,000 of Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB-\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is February 2044.\nShare Repurchase Plan\nOn December 17, 2018, the Company announced that its Board approved a new share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to 300,000 of the Company's outstanding common shares on the open market.\nOn May 11, 2016, the Company announced that its Board approved a share repurchase program under which the Company could repurchase up to 150,000 of the Company's outstanding common shares on the open market. This program terminated on November 11, 2016.\nOn November 21, 2016 the Company announced that its Board approved a new share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to 200,000 of the Company's outstanding common shares on the open market. This program terminated on May 21, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company repurchased and retired 70,000 common shares in open market transactions for $866,000 as detailed in the table below. There were no share repurchases in 2017 or 2018.\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of Shares Purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Price per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 10, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 18, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>249\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 18, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 23, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>866\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company's unused sources of liquidity consisted of $25,454,000 available through the Capital One facility; $22,927,000 available through notes payable with related parties; $2,316,000 in unrestricted cash and $9,000 in money market funds.\nRestricted cash of $29,034,000 as of December 31, 2018 is primarily held by NSBF.

At December 31, 2018, the Company determined that it is not probable that payments would be required to be made under the guarantee.\nNo amounts related to the guarantees discussed above are included in the calculation of our asset coverage ratio at December 31, 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe value investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations. However, a readily available market value is not expected to exist for many of the investments in our portfolio, and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board under our valuation policy and process. We may seek pricing information with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value such investments. We\nalso employ independent third-party valuation firms for certain of our investments for which there is not a readily available market value.\nThe application of our valuation methods may include comparisons of the portfolio companies to peer companies that are public, the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings, discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private equity valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from values that may ultimately be received or settled.\nOur Board is ultimately and solely responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value of investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels for disclosure purposes. The Company carries all investments at fair value. Additionally, the Company carries its credits in lieu of cash, notes payable in credits in lieu of cash, and servicing assets at fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority (Level 1) to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and gives the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). An asset or liability's classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of the significant input to its valuation. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury, other U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter markets. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes certain U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities, corporate debt securities, derivative contracts and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. This category generally includes certain private equity investments, retained residual interests in securitizations, residential mortgage servicing rights, and highly structured or long-term derivative contracts. \nValuation of Investments\nLevel 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of the Board to assist in the valuation of certain portfolio investments without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process.\nWhen determining fair value of Level 3 debt and equity investments, the Company may take into account the following factors, where relevant: the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio\ncompany's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded securities, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made and other relevant factors. The primary method for determining enterprise value uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's EBITDA or revenue. The enterprise value analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if debt investments are credit impaired. If debt investments are credit impaired, the Company will use the enterprise value analysis or a liquidation basis analysis to determine fair value. For debt investments that are not determined to be credit impaired, the Company uses a market interest rate yield analysis to determine fair value.\nIn addition, for certain debt investments, the Company may base its valuation on quotes provided by an independent third-party broker.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If the Company were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, the Company may realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded.\nThe Company's investments are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments are traded.\nChanges in the market environment, portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. We determine the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Our investment portfolio is carried on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities at fair value with any adjustments to fair value recognized as \"Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation)\" on the consolidated statements of operations until the investment is realized, usually upon exit, resulting in any gain or loss being recognized as a \"Net realized gains (losses).\"\nOur Board has the final responsibility for overseeing, reviewing and approving, in good faith, our determination of the fair value for our investment portfolio and our valuation procedures, consistent with 1940 Act requirements. We believe our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 approximates fair value as of those dates based on the markets in which we operate and other conditions in existence on those reporting dates.\nIncome Recognition\nInterest on loan investments is accrued and included in income based on contractual rates applied to principal amounts outstanding. Interest income is determined using a method that results in a level rate of return on principal amounts outstanding. When a loan becomes 90 days or more past due, or if we otherwise do not expect to receive interest and principal repayments, the loan is placed on non-accrual status and the recognition of interest income is discontinued. Interest payments received on loans that are on non-accrual status are treated as reductions of principal until the principal is repaid.\nWe receive servicing income related to the guaranteed portions of SBA loan investments which we sell into the secondary market. These recurring fees are earned daily and recorded when earned. Servicing income is earned for the full term of the loan or until the loan is repaid.\nWe receive a variety of fees from borrowers in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including packaging fees, legal fees, late fees and prepayment fees. All other income is recorded when earned.\nDividend income is recorded at the time dividends are declared. Distributions of earnings from portfolio companies are evaluated to determine if the distribution is income, return of capital or realized gain.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax\nassets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Company's U.S. federal and state income tax returns prior to fiscal year 2014 are generally closed, and management continually evaluates expiring statutes of limitations, audits, proposed settlements, changes in tax law and new authoritative rulings.\nThe Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with the 2015 tax year and operates in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. The RIC tax return includes Newtek Business Services Corp. and NSBF, a single member LLC disregarded for tax purposes. None of the Company's other subsidiaries are included in the RIC tax return. The Company will evaluate and record any deferred tax assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries that are not included in the RIC tax return. In order to maintain its RIC tax treatment, among other things, the Company is required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each tax year. The Company intends to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal income taxes with respect to any income that is distributed to its stockholders as dividends.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions, and would distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. The Company would then pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, no U.S. federal excise taxes were due.\nThe Company's Taxable Subsidiaries accrue income taxes payable based on the applicable corporate rates on the net unrealized appreciation generated by the controlled investments held by the Taxable Subsidiaries. Such deferred tax liabilities amounted to $9,241,000 and $8,164,000 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are recorded as a deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. The change in deferred tax liabilities is included as a component of net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force),\u201d which requires that the statement of cash flow explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this standard with respect to its statement of cash flows.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition\u201d, and most industry-specific guidance\nthroughout the Industry Topics of the ASC. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under the new guidance, an entity is required to perform the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The new guidance will significantly enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures as to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)\u201d, which clarified the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing\u201d, which clarified the implementation guidance regarding performance obligations and licensing arrangements. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)-Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients\u201d, which clarified guidance on assessing collectability, presenting sales tax, measuring noncash consideration, and certain transition matters. In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-20, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)-Technical Corrections and Improvements\u201d, which provided disclosure relief, and clarified the scope and application of the new revenue standard and related cost guidance. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim\nperiods within that reporting period. The Company has evaluated the guidance under Topic 606 and has identified similar performance obligations under ASC 606 as compared with deliverables and separate units of account previously identified. The Company adopted this standard with respect to its revenue recognition. The Company evaluated each revenue stream and concluded that all were covered by the scope exceptions as detailed in Topic 606. As a result, the Company determined that the timing of its revenue recognition will remain the same.\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)\u201d, which is intended to improve fair value and defined benefit disclosure requirements by removing disclosures that are not cost-beneficial, clarifying disclosures' specific requirements, and adding relevant disclosure requirements. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases,\u201d which amends various aspects of existing accounting guidance for leases, including the recognition of a right of use asset and a lease liability for leases with a duration of greater than one year. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements\u201d, which now allows entities the option of recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption while continuing to present all prior periods under previous lease accounting guidance. The Company has completed its review of the new guidance and estimates that approximately $8,900,000 and $10,900,000 would be recognized as total right-of-use assets and total lease liabilities, respectively. After the reversal of previously recorded deferred rent and lease incentive liabilities, the Company estimates the net impact to the Company's net assets to be an increase of approximately $119,000.\nSubsequent Events\nDividend Declaration\nOn February 15, 2019, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share payable on March 29, 2019 to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2019. The dividend will be paid in cash or shares of the Company's common stock through participation in the Company's DRIP, at the election of shareholders.\nSecuritization Activity\nOn February 25, 2019, the 2010-1 Trust was terminated as a result of NSBF purchasing the 2010-1 Trust assets, with the 2010-1 Trust's noteholders receiving the redemption price.\nCommon Stock\nFrom January 1, 2019 through March 15, 2019 the Company sold 134,658 shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $18.89 per share under the ATM Equity Distribution Agreement. Proceeds, net of offering costs and expenses were $2,544,000. As of March 15, 2019, there were 2,834,929 shares of common stock available for sale under the ATM Equity Distribution Agreement.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe impact of inflation and changing prices on our results of operations is not material.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nIntroduction and Certain Cautionary Statements\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial position of the Company together with its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.\nThe statements in this Annual Report may contain forward-looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated future financial performance, business prospects, legislative developments and similar matters. We note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results expressed in the forward looking statements such as intensified competition and/or operating problems in our operating business projects and their impact on revenues and profit margins or additional factors as described under Risk Factors\u201d above.\nWe are an internally managed BDC that is a leading national non-bank lender that provides, together with our controlled portfolio companies, a wide range of business and financial solutions under the Newtek\u00ae brand to the SMB market. Newtek's products and services include: Business Lending including SBA 7(a) loans, 504 loans and conventional loans, Electronic\nPayment Processing, Managed Technology Solutions (Cloud Computing), Technology Consulting, eCommerce, Accounts Receivable and Inventory Financing, personal and commercial lines Insurance Services, Web Services, Data Backup, Storage and Retrieval, and Payroll and Benefits Solutions to SMB accounts nationwide across all industries. We have an established and reliable platform that is not limited by client size, industry type or location. As a result, we believe we have a strong and diversified client base across every state in the U.S. and across a variety of different industries. In addition, we have developed a financial and technology based business model that enables us and our controlled portfolio companies to acquire and process our SMB clients in a cost effective manner. This capability is supported in large part by NewTracker\u00ae, our patented prospect management technology software which is similar to but we believe is better than the system popularized by Salesforce.com. We believe that this technology and low cost business model distinguishes us from our competitors.\nWe consolidate the following wholly-owned subsidiaries:\n\n(1) Entity was merged into The Whitestone Group, LLC in December 2018.\n(2) Entity was merged into The Whitestone Group, LLC in December 2017.\nWe are an internally-managed, closed-end, non-diversified investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with our 2015 tax year. As a BDC and a RIC, we are also subject to certain constraints, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code. As a result, previously consolidated subsidiaries are now recorded as investments in controlled portfolio companies, at fair value. NSBF is a consolidated subsidiary and originates loans under the SBA's 7(a) loan program.\nOur common shares are currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol NEWT\u201d.\nNSBF has been granted PLP status and originates, sells and services SBA 7(a) loans and is authorized to place SBA guarantees on loans without seeking prior SBA review and approval. Being a national lender, PLP status allows NSBF to expedite the origination of loans since NSBF is not required to present applications to the SBA for concurrent review and approval. The loss of PLP status could adversely impact our marketing efforts and ultimately our loan origination volume which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nAs a BDC, our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation primarily through loans originated by our business finance platform and our equity investments in certain portfolio companies that we control.\nWe target our debt investments, which are principally made through our business finance platform under the SBA 7(a) program, to produce a coupon rate of prime plus 2.75% which enables us to generate rapid sales of guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market. We typically structure our debt investments with the maximum seniority and collateral along with personal guarantees from portfolio company owners, in many cases collateralized by other assets including real estate. In most cases, our debt investment will be collateralized by a first lien on the assets of the portfolio company and a first or second lien on assets of guarantors, in both cases primarily real estate. All SBA loans are made with personal guarantees from any owner(s) of 20% or more of the portfolio company's equity. The amount of new debt investments, particularly SBA 7(a) loans that we originate, will directly impact future investment income. In addition, future amounts of unrealized appreciation or depreciation on our investments, as well as the amount of realized gains or losses, will also fluctuate depending upon economic conditions and the performance of our investment portfolio. The changes in realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation could have a material impact on our operating results. During 2018, sale prices for guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans were negatively impacted by market conditions, in particular a higher interest rate environment, which led to higher prepayments during the period, resulting in lower sale prices in the secondary market. A continuation or further reduction in the price of guaranteed SBA 7(a) loans could negatively impact our business.\nWe typically structure our debt investments to include non-financial covenants that seek to minimize our risk of capital loss such as lien protection and prohibitions against change of control. Our debt investments have strong protections, including default penalties, information rights and, in some cases, board observation rights and affirmative, negative and financial covenants. Debt investments in portfolio companies, including the controlled portfolio companies, have historically and are expected to continue to comprise the majority of our overall investments in number and dollar volume.\nWhile the vast majority of our investments have been structured as debt, we have in the past and expect in the future to make selective equity investments primarily as either strategic investments to enhance the integrated operating platform or, to a lesser degree, under the Capco programs. For investments in our controlled portfolio companies, we focus more on tailoring them to the long term growth needs of the companies than to return. Our objectives with these companies is to foster the development of the businesses as a part of the integrated operational platform of serving the SMB market, so we may reduce the burden on these companies to enable them to grow faster than they would otherwise and as another means of supporting their development.\nWe regularly engage in discussions with third parties with respect to various potential transactions. We may acquire an investment or a portfolio of investments or an entire company or sell a portion of our portfolio on an opportunistic basis. We, our subsidiaries, or our affiliates may also agree to manage certain other funds that invest in debt, equity or provide other financing or services to companies in a variety of industries for which we may earn management or other fees for our services. We may also invest in the equity of these funds, along with other third parties, from which we would seek to earn a return and/or future incentive allocations. Some of these transactions could be material to our business. Consummation of any such transaction will be subject to completion of due diligence, finalization of key business and financial terms (including price) and negotiation of final definitive documentation as well as a number of other factors and conditions including, without limitation, the approval of our board of directors and required regulatory or third-party consents and, in certain cases, the approval of our shareholders. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any such transaction would be consummated. Any of these transactions or funds may require significant management resources either during the transaction phase or on an ongoing basis depending on the terms of the transaction.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue in the form of interest, dividend, servicing and other fee income on debt and equity investments. Our debt investments typically have terms of 10 to 25 years and bear interest at prime plus a margin. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. We receive servicing income related to the guaranteed portions of SBA investments which we originate and sell into the\nsecondary market. These recurring fees are earned daily and recorded when earned. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of packaging, prepayment, legal and late fees. We record such fees related to loans as other income. Dividends are recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income is recorded at the time dividends are declared. Distributions of earnings from portfolio companies are evaluated to determine if the distribution is income, return of capital or capital gains.\nWe recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments and assets that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments or servicing assets, as appropriate, in the consolidated statements of operations.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses are salaries and benefits, interest expense and other general and administrative costs, such as professional fees, marketing, referral fees, servicing costs and rent. Since we are an internally-managed BDC with no outside adviser or management company, the BDC incurs all the related costs to operate the Company.\nGuarantees\nThe Company is a guarantor on the Sterling Receivable and Inventory Facility at NBC. Maximum borrowings under the Sterling Receivable and Inventory Facility are $22,500,000. The Sterling Receivable and Inventory Facility matures in February 2020 and automatically renews annually. At December 31, 2018, total principal owed by NBC was $16,477,000. In addition, the Company deposited $750,000 to collateralize the guarantee. At December 31, 2018, the Company determined that it is not probable that payments would be required to be made under the guarantee.\nThe Company is also a guarantor on the Sterling 504 Facility at NBC. Maximum borrowings under the 504 Facility are $35,000,000, depending upon syndication. The Sterling 504 Facility matures in March 2019. At December 31, 2018, total principal owed by NBC was $7,283,000. At December 31, 2018, the Company determined that it is not probable that payments would be required to be made under the guarantee.\nThe Company is a guarantor on the NBL Facility. Maximum borrowings under the NBL Facility are $75,000,000 with an accordion feature to increase maximum borrowings to $150,000,000. The NBL Facility matures in July 2021. At December 31, 2018, total principal owed by NBL was $13,855,000. At December 31, 2018, the Company determined that it is not probable that payments would be required to be made under the guarantee.\nThe Company is a guarantor on the Webster Facility, a term loan facility between NMS and Webster Bank with an aggregate principal amount up to $50,000,000. The Webster Facility matures in November 2023. At December 31, 2018, total principal outstanding was $35,000,000. At December 31, 2018, the Company determined that it is not probable that payments would be required to be made under the guarantee.\nNo amounts related to the guarantees discussed above are included in the calculation of our asset coverage ratio at December 31, 2018.\nUnfunded Commitments\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had $8,234,000 of unfunded commitments in connection with its SBA 7(a) non-affiliate investments related to portions of loans originated which are partially funded. The Company will fund these commitments from the same sources it uses to fund its other investment commitments.\nLoan Portfolio Asset Quality and Composition\nThe following table sets forth distribution by business type of the Company's SBA 7(a) unguaranteed loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 on a cost basis (in thousands):\n\nThe following table sets forth distribution by business type of the Company's SBA 7(a) unguaranteed loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 on a cost basis (in thousands):\n\nThe following table sets forth distribution by borrower's credit score of the Company's SBA 7(a) unguaranteed loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 on a cost basis (in thousands):\n\nThe following table sets forth distribution by borrower's credit score of the Company's SBA 7(a) unguaranteed loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 on a cost basis (in thousands):\n\nThe following table sets forth distribution by primary collateral type of the Company's SBA 7(a) unguaranteed loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 on a cost basis (in thousands):\n\nThe following table sets forth distribution by primary collateral type of the Company's SBA 7(a) unguaranteed loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 on a cost basis (in thousands):\n\nThe following table sets forth distribution by days delinquent of the Company's SBA 7(a) unguaranteed loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 on a cost basis (in thousands):\n\nThe following table sets forth distribution by days delinquent of the Company's SBA 7(a) unguaranteed loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 on a cost basis (in thousands):\n\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nInvestment Income \nInterest Income\nThe increase in interest income was attributable to the average outstanding performing portfolio of SBA non-affiliate investments increasing to $282,378,000 from $227,761,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, combined with an increase in the Prime Rate. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Prime Rate was increased three times, to 3.75%, effective January 2017, to 4.00%, effective April 2017 and to 4.25%, effective July 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018 the Prime Rate was increased three times, from 4.50% in January 2018 to 4.75%, effective April 2018, to 5.00% effective July 2018, and to 5.25% effective October 2018. The increase in the average outstanding performing portfolio resulted from the origination of new SBA non-affiliate investments during the year. We also recognized an additional $1,309,000 of interest income year over year from holding SBA guaranteed loans. Offsetting these increases was $1,493,000 of interest income related to accrued non-performing interest owed by two borrowers who paid their accrued interest balance in full in 2017.\nDividend Income\n\nDividend income increased $2,883,000 year over year based on each portfolio company's financial results. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we earned $275,000 of dividend income from UCS, a wholly-owned controlled portfolio company that we invested in October 2017. See Note 3 for the discussion on the subsequent sale of UCS. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we earned an additional $600,000 of dividend income from IPM and SIDCO (combined as SIDCO was spun-off as a separate entity from IPM in July 2017), as a result of ownership for the full year. The increase in dividend income from NMS and Premier was a result increased profitability year over year, as well as an additional dividend paid by Premier in the fourth quarter of 2018 resulting from a portion of the gain recognized from the sale of one of its merchant portfolios. Dividend income is dependent on portfolio company earnings. Current period dividend income may not be indicative of future period dividend income.\nNSBF Servicing Portfolio and Related Servicing Income\nThe following table represents NSBF originated servicing portfolio and servicing income earned for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\n(1) Of this amount, the total average NSBF originated portfolio earning servicing income was $975,852,000 and $783,578,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe increase in servicing income was attributable to the increase in total portfolio investments for which we earn servicing income. The portfolio earning servicing income increased $192,274,000 year over year. The increase was attributable to an increase in SBA 7(a) non-affiliate investments from 2017 to 2018.\nOther Income\nOther income relates primarily to legal, packaging, prepayment, and late fees earned from SBA 7(a) loans. The increase was related to an increase in legal and packaging fees earned as a result of the larger dollar volume of loans originated.\nExpenses: \nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits increased $1,790,000 primarily due to an increase in headcount at NSBF. The additional headcount relates primarily to employees performing loan processing, loan closing or loan servicing functions as a result of the increase in loan originations.\nInterest Expense\nThe following is a summary of interest expense by facility for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\nThe increase in interest expense year over year is primarily related to interest from the Notes payable - Securitization trusts and 2023 Notes. The increase from Notes payable - Securitization trusts was the result of an additional securitization transaction completed in December 2017. We recognized $3,483,000 of interest expense attributable to the 2023 Notes, offset by the decrease in interest expense related the 2021 Notes of $2,446,000 as a result of our redemption of $40,250,000 of the 2021 Notes in March 2018 and issuance of $57,500,000 of 2023 Notes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we redeemed all $40,250,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes at 100% of their principal amount ($25 per Note), plus the accrued and unpaid interest thereon from December 31, 2017, through, but excluding, the Redemption Date. As a result, we recorded loss on extinguishment of debt of $1,059,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOrigination and Servicing\nThe increase in origination and servicing expenses was attributed to an increase in referral fees of $998,000 resulting from increased SBA 7(a) loan originations year over year, as well as a $1,493,000 increase in loan processing, liquidation and loan recovery expenses, all of which resulted from an increase in the outstanding loan portfolio period over period.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\nA portion of our investments in IPM and Mobil Money consisted of contingent consideration based on both entities attaining specific income levels for 2018 and 2017 with respect to our investment in IPM and 2018 and 2019 with respect to our investment in Mobil Money. As a result, we decreased the contingent consideration liability by $51,000 and $455,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nNet Realized Gains and Net Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation\nNet realized gains from SBA non-affiliate investments for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $42,845,000 and $39,617,000, respectively, which includes realized losses on SBA non-affiliate investments of $2,738,000 and $894,000 during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the second half of 2018, sale prices for guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans were negatively impacted by market conditions, in particular a higher interest rate environment, which led to higher prepayments during the period resulting in lower sale prices in the secondary market. A continuation or further reduction in the price of guaranteed SBA 7(a) loans could negatively impact our business.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company originated a non-SBA, conventional loan for $5,700,000 which was sold for $5,978,000 resulting in a realized gain of $278,000.\nNet Realized Gains on SBA Non-Affiliate Investments\n\n(1) Realized gains greater than 110.00% must be split 50/50 with the SBA in accordance with SBA regulations. The realized gains recognized above reflects amounts net of split with the SBA.\nNet Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments\n\nNet unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on SBA guaranteed non-affiliate investments relates to the guaranteed portions of SBA debt investments originated which the Company sells into a secondary market. Unrealized appreciation of SBA guaranteed non-affiliate investments represents the fair value adjustment of guaranteed portions of loans which have not yet been sold. Unrealized depreciation represents the reversal of unrealized appreciation when the SBA 7(a) loans are sold. Valuation of SBA guaranteed non-affiliate investments were negatively impacted in 2018 due to market conditions and a higher interest rate environment which resulted in increased prepayment speeds.\nNet Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Controlled Investments\n\n(1)At December 31, 2018, Premier merged into NMS and as a result the valuation of NMS and related unrealized appreciation represents that of the combined entity.\nUnrealized appreciation related to our investment in NMS was related to an increase in revenue and EBITDA projections combined with a decrease in the corporate income tax rate as recently enacted by Congress.\nUnrealized depreciation related to our investment in NTS was primarily due to the cybersecurity event at NTS in early 2018, as well as NTS' inability to add sufficient new business and resulting decline in revenue. NTS expects to incur additional costs associated with the continued cyber security remediation.\nThe increase of $3,000,000 at NBL and corresponding decrease of $3,000,000 at NBC during the year ended December 31, 2018 was a result of NBC's SBA 504 lending program being conducted by NBL. NBL's business will focus on SBA 504 and construction lending, while NBC focuses on accounts receivable and inventory financing.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we contributed $381,000 and $135,000 to PMT and NIA, respectively, for working capital needs. Based on PMT's and NIA's inability to generate sufficient cash flows and their continued losses, we recognized unrealized depreciation of $381,000 and $420,000 for the year.\nWe recognized $4,939,000 in unrealized depreciation on our investment in BSP during the year ended December 31, 2018, which includes $1,509,000 in capital contributions which increased the cost basis of our investment in BSP. The valuation change for the year ended December 31, 2018, was the result of several quantitative and qualitative factors. On a quantitative basis, BSP's financial performance has declined since we made our initial investment in BSP in 2016, and BSP has since lost customers, materially impacting its business. Second, as previously disclosed, on October 12, 2017, the FBI executed a search warrant at BSP's office in Westfield, Indiana. In addition, Kerri Agee, the former owner and President of BSP, was terminated in April 2018. As a result of the foregoing factors which have impacted BSP's ability to retain customers, BSP has assigned a significant number of its customer servicing agreements to SBL, as well as transferred remaining employees of BSP to SBL to continue to service those customers. As such, BSP was determined to have a fair value of zero as of December 31, 2018 and SBL's value increased due to the additional cash flows from the assigned third-party servicing accounts.\nProvision for Deferred Taxes on Net Unrealized Appreciation of Investments\nCertain consolidated subsidiaries of ours are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. These taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes, but are consolidated for GAAP purposes, and may generate income tax liabilities or assets from temporary differences in the recognition of items for financial reporting and income tax purposes at the subsidiaries. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized a provision for deferred taxes of\n$1,077,000 and $2,179,000, respectively, related to the net unrealized appreciation of controlled portfolio company investments.\nNet Unrealized Depreciation on Servicing Assets\n\nThe increase in unrealized depreciation on servicing assets is primarily related to the increase in the discount rate from 12.20% to 14.24%, coupled with an increase in the cumulative prepayment rate from 18.50% to 26.00%.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nInvestment Income \nInterest Income\nThe increase in interest income was attributable to the average outstanding performing portfolio of SBA non-affiliate investments increasing to $227,761,000 from $176,210,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, combined with an increase in the Prime Rate. During the year ended December 31, 2016 the Prime Rate was 3.50%. During the year ended December 31, 2017 the Prime Rate was increased three times to 3.75%, effective January 2017, to 4.00%, effective April 2017 and to 4.25%, effective July 2017. The increase in the average outstanding performing portfolio resulted from the origination of new SBA non-affiliate investments during the year. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $1,493,000 of interest income related to accrued non-performing interest owed by two borrowers who paid their accrued interest balance in full.\nDividend Income\n\nDividend income decreased $826,000 year over year. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we earned $200,000 of dividend income from NBC, $550,000 and $225,000 of dividend income from IPM and SIDCO, respectively, both new wholly-\nowned controlled portfolio companies that we invested in on April 6, 2017. Dividend income earned from NMS increased $300,000 year over year. These increases were offset by decreases in dividend income earned from NTS, SBL and BSP. Dividend income is dependent on portfolio company earnings. Current period dividend income may not be indicative of future period dividend income.\nNSBF Servicing Portfolio and Related Servicing Income\nThe following table represents NSBF originated servicing portfolio and servicing income earned for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\n(1) Of this amount, the total average NSBF originated portfolio earning servicing income was $783,578,000 and $633,126,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe increase in servicing income was attributable to the increase in total portfolio investments for which we earn servicing income. The portfolio earning servicing income increased $150,452,000 year over year. The increase was attributable to an increase in SBA 7(a) non-affiliate investments from 2016 to 2017.\nOther Income\nOther income relates primarily to legal, packaging, prepayment, and late fees earned from SBA 7(a) loans. The increase was related to an increase in legal and packaging fees earned as a result of the larger dollar volume of loans originated.\nExpenses: \nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits increased $4,058,000 primarily due to an increase in headcount at NSBF. The additional headcount relates primarily to employees performing loan processing, loan closing or loan servicing functions as a result of the increase in loan originations. The increase in salaries and benefits was also related to a $386,000 increase in stock-based compensation expense year over year.\nInterest Expense\nThe following is a summary of interest expense by facility for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\nThe increase in interest expense year over year is primarily related to interest from the Notes payable - Securitization trusts, 2021 Notes and Notes payable - related parties. The increase from Notes payable - Securitization trusts was the result of an additional securitization transaction completed in November 2016 and December 2017. In April 2016, we issued $40,250,000 of 2021 Notes bearing interest at 7.00%. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred a full year of interest expense as compared to a partial year of interest expense in 2016. The increase from Notes payable - related parties was related to the increase in the average outstanding balance year over year.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\nA portion of our investment in IPM consisted of contingent consideration based on IPM attaining specific EBITDA levels for 2017 and 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we reduced the contingent consideration liability by $455,000 based on the probability of IPM attaining specific EBITDA levels for 2017 and 2018.\nOther General and Administrative Costs\nOther general and administrative costs include managed IT services, marketing, rent and other costs. In April 2016, the Company moved its headquarters to Lake Success, New York. As a result, the Company vacated its spaces in West Hempstead, New York and New York, New York. The Company recorded a loss of $604,000 related to the remaining liabilities under the West Hempstead lease, offset by future rental income, during the year ended December 31, 2016. No such expense was incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company has sublet both spaces. This decrease was offset by $1,397,000 of bad debt expense related to amounts owed from related parties, primarily PMT and BSP, which we determined to be uncollectible and an increase in referral fees of $485,000 related to the increase in loan originations year over year.\nNet Realized Gains and Net Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation\nNet realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the cost basis of our investments without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized and includes investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments reflects the change in portfolio investment fair values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.\nNet Realized Gains on SBA Non-Affiliate Investments\nNet realized gains from SBA non-affiliate investments for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $39,617,000 and $31,512,000, respectively, which includes realized losses of $894,000 and $925,000 during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\n(1) Realized gains greater than 110.00% must be split 50/50 with the SBA in accordance with SBA regulations. The realized gains recognized above reflects amounts net of split with the SBA.\nNet Realized Gains (Losses) on Controlled Investments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 we recorded $200,000 in net realized losses from controlled portfolio companies which consisted of a $100,000 realized gain from a distribution in excess of cost basis from SBL and a $300,000 realized loss related to the reversal of unrealized depreciation on a debt investment in The Secure CyberGateway, LLC. For the year ended December 31, 2016, realized gains on controlled investments were $108,000 and represented distributions from SBL in excess of cost basis.\nNet Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments\n\nNet unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on SBA guaranteed non-affiliate investments relates to guaranteed portions of SBA debt investments made which the Company sells into a secondary market. Unrealized appreciation of SBA guaranteed investments represents the fair value adjustment of guaranteed portions of loans which have not yet been sold. Unrealized depreciation represents the reversal of unrealized appreciation when the SBA 7(a) loans are sold.\nNet Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Controlled Investments\n\nUnrealized appreciation related to our investment in NMS and Premier was related to an increase in revenue and EBITDA projections combined with a decrease in the corporate income tax rate as recently enacted by Congress. Unrealized appreciation related to our investment in NBC was related to growth in its SBA 504 lending program and growth in its accounts receivable and inventory financing programs.\nUnrealized depreciation related to our investment in NTS was related to weak financial performance. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we made an additional $1,000,000 debt investment in NPS. Due to NPS' continued negative cash flows, we recorded an unrealized loss of $3,045,000 on our total investment in NPS, which consisted of an $860,000 equity investment and $2,185,000 of debt investments, including a $1,000,000 investment made in NPS in 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a $2,000,000 unrealized loss on its investment in BSP to reflect the potential impact to the business and tradename as a result of the FBI investigation discussed in Note 9.\nProvision for Deferred Taxes on Net Unrealized Appreciation of Investments\nCertain consolidated subsidiaries of ours are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. These taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes, but are consolidated for GAAP purposes, and may generate income tax liabilities or assets from temporary differences in the recognition of items for financial reporting and income tax purposes at the subsidiaries. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized a provision for deferred taxes of $2,179,000 and $5,128,000, respectively, related to the net unrealized appreciation of controlled portfolio company investments.\nNet Unrealized Depreciation on Servicing Assets\n\nThe increase in unrealized depreciation on servicing assets is primarily related to the increase in the discount rate from 12.20% to 13.06% and an increase in the cumulative prepayment rate from 18.50% to 20.00%.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived from our Capital One Facility, Notes payable - related parties, 2022 Notes, 2023 Notes, securitization transactions and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our borrowings and the proceeds from the turnover of our portfolio and from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives. We may raise additional equity or debt capital through both registered offerings off a shelf registration, including At-The-Market\u201d, or ATM, and private offerings of securities. As of December 31, 2018, our asset coverage was 185%. See Regulation.\u201d\nPublic Offerings\nATM Program\nThe ATM Equity Distribution Agreement provides that we may offer and sell up to 4,400,000 shares of common stock from time to time through the Placement Agents. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold 291,232 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $19.14 per share. Proceeds, net of offering costs and expenses were $5,196,000. The Company may offer up to an additional 2,969,587 shares of common stock under the ATM Equity Distribution Agreement as of December 31, 2018.\nWe used the net proceeds for funding investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with our investment objective and strategies and for general corporate purposes including funding investments, repaying outstanding indebtedness and other general corporate purposes.\nEquity Offerings\nIn January 2017 we completed a public offering of 2,250,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $15.25 per share and an additional 337,500 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $15.25 per share pursuant to the underwriter's full exercise of the over-allotment option.

The facility was amended again in June 2018 and the portion of the facility collateralized by the government guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans, was reduced to Prime minus 0.75% (previously Prime minus 0.25%). The interest rate on the portion of the facility, collateralized by the non-guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans, was reduced to Prime plus 0.25% (previously Prime plus 0.75%). The facility provides for a 55% advance rate on the non-guaranteed portions of the SBA 7(a) loans NSBF originates, and a 90% advance rate on the guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans NSBF originates. In addition, the amendment extended the date on which the facility will convert to a term loan from May 16, 2017 to May 11, 2020 and extended the maturity date of the facility to May 11, 2022.\nAt December 31, 2018, there was $34,700,000 outstanding under the guaranteed line of credit. No amounts were outstanding under the unguaranteed line of credit.

The Related Party RLOC has a maturity date of November 8, 2023. Outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2018 were $16,840,000.\nSecuritization Transactions\nSince 2010, NSBF has engaged in securitizations of the unguaranteed portions of its SBA 7(a) loans. In the securitization, it uses a special purpose entity (the Trust\u201d) which is considered a variable interest entity. Applying the consolidation requirements for VIEs under the accounting rules in ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, and ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, which became effective January 1, 2010, the Company determined that as the primary beneficiary of the securitization vehicle, based on its power to direct activities through its role as servicer for the Trust and its obligation to absorb losses and right to receive benefits, it needed to consolidate the Trusts. NSBF therefore consolidated the entity using the carrying amounts of the Trust's assets and liabilities. NSBF reflects the assets in SBA Unguaranteed Non-Affiliate Investments and reflects the associated financing in Notes Payable - Securitization Trusts.\nIn November 2016, NSBF completed its seventh securitization which resulted in the transfer of $56,073,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2016-1 Trust. The 2016-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $53,444,000, consisting of $43,632,000 Class A notes and $9,812,000 of Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB+\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is February 2042.\nIn December 2017, NSBF completed its eighth securitization which resulted in the transfer of $76,188,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2017-1 Trust. The 2017-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $75,426,000, consisting of $58,111,000 Class A notes and $17,315,000 of Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB-\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is February 2043.\nIn October 2018, the 2013-1 Trust was terminated as a result of NSBF purchasing the 2013-1 Trust assets, with the 2013-1 Trust's noteholders receiving the redemption price. Certain of the 2013-1 Trust's assets were subsequently transferred to the 2018-1 Trust.\nIn November 2018, NSBF completed its ninth securitization which resulted in the transfer of $108,551,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2018-1 Trust. The 2018-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $108,551,000, consisting of $82,876,000 Class A notes and $25,675,000 of Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement. The Class A and Class B notes received an A\u201d and BBB-\u201d rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is February 2044.\nShare Repurchase Plan\nOn December 17, 2018, the Company announced that its Board approved a new share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to 300,000 of the Company's outstanding common shares on the open market.\nOn May 11, 2016, the Company announced that its Board approved a share repurchase program under which the Company could repurchase up to 150,000 of the Company's outstanding common shares on the open market. This program terminated on November 11, 2016.\nOn November 21, 2016 the Company announced that its Board approved a new share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to 200,000 of the Company's outstanding common shares on the open market.

Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe value investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations. However, a readily available market value is not expected to exist for many of the investments in our portfolio, and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board under our valuation policy and process. We may seek pricing information with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value such investments. We\nalso employ independent third-party valuation firms for certain of our investments for which there is not a readily available market value.\nThe application of our valuation methods may include comparisons of the portfolio companies to peer companies that are public, the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings, discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private equity valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from values that may ultimately be received or settled.\nOur Board is ultimately and solely responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value of investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels for disclosure purposes. The Company carries all investments at fair value. Additionally, the Company carries its credits in lieu of cash, notes payable in credits in lieu of cash, and servicing assets at fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority (Level 1) to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and gives the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). An asset or liability's classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of the significant input to its valuation. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury, other U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter markets. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes certain U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities, corporate debt securities, derivative contracts and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. This category generally includes certain private equity investments, retained residual interests in securitizations, residential mortgage servicing rights, and highly structured or long-term derivative contracts. \nValuation of Investments\nLevel 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of the Board to assist in the valuation of certain portfolio investments without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process.\nWhen determining fair value of Level 3 debt and equity investments, the Company may take into account the following factors, where relevant: the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio\ncompany's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded securities, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made and other relevant factors. The primary method for determining enterprise value uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's EBITDA or revenue. The enterprise value analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if debt investments are credit impaired. If debt investments are credit impaired, the Company will use the enterprise value analysis or a liquidation basis analysis to determine fair value. For debt investments that are not determined to be credit impaired, the Company uses a market interest rate yield analysis to determine fair value.\nIn addition, for certain debt investments, the Company may base its valuation on quotes provided by an independent third-party broker.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If the Company were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, the Company may realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded.\nThe Company's investments are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments are traded.\nChanges in the market environment, portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. We determine the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Our investment portfolio is carried on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities at fair value with any adjustments to fair value recognized as \"Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation)\" on the consolidated statements of operations until the investment is realized, usually upon exit, resulting in any gain or loss being recognized as a \"Net realized gains (losses).\"\nOur Board has the final responsibility for overseeing, reviewing and approving, in good faith, our determination of the fair value for our investment portfolio and our valuation procedures, consistent with 1940 Act requirements. We believe our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 approximates fair value as of those dates based on the markets in which we operate and other conditions in existence on those reporting dates.\nIncome Recognition\nInterest on loan investments is accrued and included in income based on contractual rates applied to principal amounts outstanding. Interest income is determined using a method that results in a level rate of return on principal amounts outstanding. When a loan becomes 90 days or more past due, or if we otherwise do not expect to receive interest and principal repayments, the loan is placed on non-accrual status and the recognition of interest income is discontinued. Interest payments received on loans that are on non-accrual status are treated as reductions of principal until the principal is repaid.\nWe receive servicing income related to the guaranteed portions of SBA loan investments which we sell into the secondary market. These recurring fees are earned daily and recorded when earned. Servicing income is earned for the full term of the loan or until the loan is repaid.\nWe receive a variety of fees from borrowers in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including packaging fees, legal fees, late fees and prepayment fees. All other income is recorded when earned.\nDividend income is recorded at the time dividends are declared. Distributions of earnings from portfolio companies are evaluated to determine if the distribution is income, return of capital or realized gain.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax\nassets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Company's U.S. federal and state income tax returns prior to fiscal year 2014 are generally closed, and management continually evaluates expiring statutes of limitations, audits, proposed settlements, changes in tax law and new authoritative rulings.\nThe Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with the 2015 tax year and operates in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. The RIC tax return includes Newtek Business Services Corp. and NSBF, a single member LLC disregarded for tax purposes. None of the Company's other subsidiaries are included in the RIC tax return. The Company will evaluate and record any deferred tax assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries that are not included in the RIC tax return. In order to maintain its RIC tax treatment, among other things, the Company is required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each tax year. The Company intends to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal income taxes with respect to any income that is distributed to its stockholders as dividends.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions, and would distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. The Company would then pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, no U.S. federal excise taxes were due.\nThe Company's Taxable Subsidiaries accrue income taxes payable based on the applicable corporate rates on the net unrealized appreciation generated by the controlled investments held by the Taxable Subsidiaries. Such deferred tax liabilities amounted to $9,241,000 and $8,164,000 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are recorded as a deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. The change in deferred tax liabilities is included as a component of net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force),\u201d which requires that the statement of cash flow explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this standard with respect to its statement of cash flows.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition\u201d, and most industry-specific guidance\nthroughout the Industry Topics of the ASC. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under the new guidance, an entity is required to perform the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The new guidance will significantly enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures as to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)\u201d, which clarified the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing\u201d, which clarified the implementation guidance regarding performance obligations and licensing arrangements. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)-Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients\u201d, which clarified guidance on assessing collectability, presenting sales tax, measuring noncash consideration, and certain transition matters. In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-20, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)-Technical Corrections and Improvements\u201d, which provided disclosure relief, and clarified the scope and application of the new revenue standard and related cost guidance. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim\nperiods within that reporting period. The Company has evaluated the guidance under Topic 606 and has identified similar performance obligations under ASC 606 as compared with deliverables and separate units of account previously identified. The Company adopted this standard with respect to its revenue recognition. The Company evaluated each revenue stream and concluded that all were covered by the scope exceptions as detailed in Topic 606. As a result, the Company determined that the timing of its revenue recognition will remain the same.\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)\u201d, which is intended to improve fair value and defined benefit disclosure requirements by removing disclosures that are not cost-beneficial, clarifying disclosures' specific requirements, and adding relevant disclosure requirements. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases,\u201d which amends various aspects of existing accounting guidance for leases, including the recognition of a right of use asset and a lease liability for leases with a duration of greater than one year. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements\u201d, which now allows entities the option of recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption while continuing to present all prior periods under previous lease accounting guidance. The Company has completed its review of the new guidance and estimates that approximately $8,900,000 and $10,900,000 would be recognized as total right-of-use assets and total lease liabilities, respectively. After the reversal of previously recorded deferred rent and lease incentive liabilities, the Company estimates the net impact to the Company's net assets to be an increase of approximately $119,000.\nSubsequent Events\nDividend Declaration\nOn February 15, 2019, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share payable on March 29, 2019 to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2019. The dividend will be paid in cash or shares of the Company's common stock through participation in the Company's DRIP, at the election of shareholders.\nSecuritization Activity\nOn February 25, 2019, the 2010-1 Trust was terminated as a result of NSBF purchasing the 2010-1 Trust assets, with the 2010-1 Trust's noteholders receiving the redemption price.\nCommon Stock\nFrom January 1, 2019 through March 15, 2019 the Company sold 134,658 shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $18.89 per share under the ATM Equity Distribution Agreement. Proceeds, net of offering costs and expenses were $2,544,000. As of March 15, 2019, there were 2,834,929 shares of common stock available for sale under the ATM Equity Distribution Agreement.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe impact of inflation and changing prices on our results of operations is not material.", "item_7_tables": "Table 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Small Business Finance, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Asset Backed Securities, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCC Real Estate Holdings, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Whitestone Group, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Colorado Partners, LLC (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire DC Partners, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Holdings I, Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Louisiana BIDCO, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Louisiana Partners II, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Louisiana Partners III, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Louisiana Partners IV, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire New York Advisers II, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire New York Partners III, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire New York Partners IV, LLC (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire New York Partners V, LLC (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wilshire Partners, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exponential Business Development Co., Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Commercial Lending, Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek LSP Holdco, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NBSH Holdings, LLC\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Business Services Holdco 1, Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Business Services Holdco 2, Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Business Services Holdco 3, Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Business Services Holdco 4, Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newtek Business Services Holdco 5, Inc.

an internally-managed BDC that provides financing and services to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Its products include SBA loans, electronic payment processing, managed technology solutions, and more.\n\n- It has a diversified client base across industries and all 50 states. Newtek uses its proprietary prospect management system NewTracker to acquire and service SMB clients in a cost-effective manner. \n\nFinancial Highlights\n- Total investment income was $49.5 million in 2018, up from $38.9 million in 2017, driven by increases in interest income, dividend income, servicing income and other income.\n\n- Net realized gains on SBA non-affiliate investments was $42.8 million in 2018 compared to $39.6 million in 2017. However, sale prices were negatively impacted in 2018 by higher interest rates and prepayments.\n\n- Unrealized appreciation on investments was $5.7 million in 2018 versus $10.8 million in 2017, mainly due to market conditions affecting SBA loan valuations.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- As of December 31, 2018, Newtek had $25.5 million available on its credit facility, $22.9 million on its related party line of credit, and $2.3 million in unrestricted cash.\n\n- In 2018, it raised $37 million in a public stock offering and $19.6 million from its ATM program. It also issued $57.5 million in 6.25% unsecured notes due 2023.\n\n- Net cash used in operating activities was $73.7 million in 2018 primarily due to SBA lending activities. Net cash from financing activities was $85.1 million.\n\nDoes this help summarize the key points? Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions."}
