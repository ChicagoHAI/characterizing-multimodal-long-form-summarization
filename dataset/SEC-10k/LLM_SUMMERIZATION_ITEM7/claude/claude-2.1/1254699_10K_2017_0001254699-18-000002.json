Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information concerning our results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.\nOverview\nQVC, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (\"QVC\" or the \"Company\") is a retailer of a wide range of consumer products, which are marketed and sold primarily by merchandise-focused televised shopping programs, the Internet and mobile applications.\nIn the United States (\"U.S.\"), QVC's televised shopping programs, including live and recorded content, are broadcast across multiple channels nationally on a full-time basis, including QVC, QVC2 and Beauty iQ. The Company's U.S. programming is also available on QVC.com, QVC's U.S. website; mobile applications via streaming video; over-the-air broadcasters; and over-the-top content platforms (Roku, Apple TV, Facebook, etc.).\nQVC believes that the Company's digital platforms complement the Company's televised shopping programs by allowing consumers to purchase a wide assortment of goods offered on QVC's televised programs, as well as other products that are available only on the Company's digital platforms. The Company views e-commerce as a natural extension of the Company's business, allowing the Company to stream live video and offer on-demand video segments of items recently presented live on QVC's televised programs. The Company's digital platforms allow shoppers to browse, research, compare and perform targeted searches for products, control the order-entry process and conveniently access their QVC account.\nQVC's international televised shopping programs, including live and recorded content, are distributed to households outside of the U.S., primarily in Germany, Austria, Japan, the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), the Republic of Ireland, Italy and France. In some of the countries where QVC operates, QVC's televised shopping programs are broadcast across multiple QVC channels: QVC Beauty & Style and QVC2 in Germany and QVC Beauty, QVC Extra and QVC Style in the U.K. The programming created for most of these markets is also available via streaming video on QVC's digital platforms. QVC's international business employs product sourcing teams who select products tailored to the interests of each local market.\nThe Company's Japanese operations (\"QVC-Japan\") are conducted through a joint venture with Mitsui & Co., LTD (\"Mitsui\"). QVC-Japan is owned 60% by the Company and 40% by Mitsui. The Company and Mitsui share in all profits and losses based on their respective ownership interests. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, QVC-Japan paid dividends to Mitsui of $40 million, $39 million and $36 million, respectively.\nThe Company also has a joint venture with CNR Media Group, formerly known as China Broadcasting Corporation, a limited liability company owned by China National Radio (''CNR''). The Company owns a 49% interest in a CNR subsidiary, CNR Home Shopping Co., Ltd. (''CNRS''). CNRS operates a retail business in China through a shopping television channel with an associated website. This joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment recorded as equity in losses of investee in the consolidated statements of operations.\nII-1\nThe Company is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive Corporation (\"Liberty\"), which owns interests in a broad range of digital commerce businesses, and is attributed to Liberty's QVC Group. The QVC Group common stock (Nasdaq: QVCA and QVCB) tracks the assets and liabilities of the QVC Group. The QVC Group tracks the Company, zulily, llc (\"zulily\") and HSN, Inc. (\"HSN\"), cash and certain liabilities. On April 4, 2017, Liberty entered into an agreement with General Communication, Inc. (\"GCI\"), an Alaska corporation, and Liberty Interactive LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty, whereby Liberty will acquire GCI through a reorganization in which certain assets and liabilities attributed to Liberty's Ventures Group will be contributed to GCI in exchange for a controlling interest in GCI. Liberty will then effect a tax-free separation of its controlling interest in the combined company. The transactions are expected to be consummated on March 9, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Simultaneous with that closing, the QVC Group common stock will become the only outstanding common stock of Liberty, and thus QVC Group common stock will cease to function as tracking stock and will effectively become regular common stock. In addition, Liberty will be renamed Qurate Retail Group, Inc., with QVC, HSN and zulily as wholly-owned subsidiaries. On December 29, 2017, Liberty completed the acquisition of the remaining 62% ownership interest of HSN in an all-stock transaction. HSN is attributed to the QVC Group. The QVC Group does not represent a separate legal entity; rather, it represents those businesses, assets and liabilities that are attributed to that group. HSN is not included in the results of operations or financial position of QVC presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nOn October 1, 2015, Liberty acquired all of the outstanding shares of zulily and QVC declared and paid a dividend to Liberty in the amount of $910 million with funds drawn from the Company's credit facility to support Liberty's purchase. zulily is an online retailer offering customers a fun and entertaining shopping experience with a fresh selection of new product styles launched each day for a limited time period. zulily is attributed to the QVC Group and the Company believes that its business is complementary to the Company. zulily is not part of the results of operations or financial position of QVC presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2017, QVC and zulily engaged in multiple transactions relating to sales, sourcing of merchandise, marketing initiatives, business advisory services and software development. The gross value of these transactions totaled $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and less than $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which did not have a material impact on QVC's financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.\nOn June 23, 2016, QVC amended and restated its senior secured credit facility (the \"Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\") increasing the revolving credit facility from $2.25 billion to $2.65 billion as explained further in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement includes a $400 million tranche that may be borrowed by QVC or zulily. Under the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, QVC and zulily are jointly and severally liable for all amounts borrowed on the $400 million tranche. In accordance with the accounting guidance for obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements, QVC will record a liability for amounts it has borrowed under the credit facility plus any additional amount it expects to repay on behalf of zulily. As of December 31, 2017, there was $267 million borrowed by zulily on the $400 million tranche of the senior secured credit facility, none of which the Company expects to repay on behalf of zulily.\nQVC engages with CommerceHub, Inc. (\"CommerceHub\") which was an approximately 99% owned subsidiary of Liberty prior to the completion of its spin-off from Liberty in July 2016, to handle communications between QVC and certain of its vendors for drop ship sales and returns. CommerceHub is not part of the results of operations or financial position of QVC presented in our consolidated financial statements. During each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, QVC paid CommerceHub for the related services totaling less than $3 million, which did not have a material impact on QVC's financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. On July 22, 2016, Liberty completed the spin-off of CommerceHub. As a result, Liberty and CommerceHub are now separate publicly traded companies.\nStrategies and challenges of business units\nQVC's goal is to become the preeminent global multimedia shopping community for people who love to shop, and to offer a shopping experience that is as much about entertainment and enrichment as it is about buying. QVC's objective is to provide an integrated shopping experience that utilizes all forms of media including television, the Internet and mobile devices. QVC intends to employ several strategies to achieve these goals and objectives. Among these strategies are to (i) extend the breadth, relevance and exposure of the QVC brand; (ii) source products that represent unique quality and value; (iii) create engaging presentation content in televised programming, mobile and online; (iv) leverage customer loyalty and continue multi-platform expansion; and (v) create a compelling and differentiated customer experience. In addition, QVC expects to expand globally by leveraging its existing systems, infrastructure and skills in other countries around the world.\nII-2\nQVC's future net revenue growth will primarily depend on sales growth from e-commerce and mobile platforms, additions of new customers from households already receiving QVC's television programming and increased spending from existing customers. QVC's future net revenue may also be affected by (i) the willingness of cable television and direct-to-home satellite system operators to continue carrying QVC's programming service; (ii) QVC's ability to maintain favorable channel positioning, which may become more difficult due to governmental action or from distributors converting analog customers to digital; (iii) changes in television viewing habits because of personal video recorders, video-on-demand and Internet video services; and (iv) general economic conditions.\nIn March 2013, QVC-U.S. launched over-the-air broadcasting in designated U.S. markets that can be accessed by any television household with a digital antenna in such markets, regardless of whether it subscribes to a paid television service. This allows QVC-U.S. to reach new customers who previously did not have access to the program through other television platforms. In August 2013, QVC-U.S. launched an additional channel, QVC2, which is being distributed through cable and satellite systems. The channel allows viewers to have access to a broader range of QVC programming options as well as more relevant programming for viewers in differing time zones. In October 2016, QVC-U.S. launched a third channel, Beauty iQ, which is being distributed through satellite and streaming platforms. The channel and supporting platforms are dedicated to a complete beauty shopping experience for customers.\nInternationally, beyond the main QVC channels, QVC-International broadcasts pre-recorded and live shows on additional channels that offer viewers access to a broader range of QVC programming options. These channels include QVC Beauty & Style and QVC2 in Germany and QVC Beauty, QVC Extra and QVC Style in the U.K.\nEconomic uncertainty in various regions of the world in which our subsidiaries and affiliates operate could adversely affect demand for our products and services since a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from discretionary spending by individuals, which typically falls during times of economic instability. Global financial markets have recently experienced disruptions, including increased volatility and diminished liquidity and credit availability. If economic and financial market conditions in the U.S. or other key markets, including Japan and Europe, become uncertain or deteriorate , our customers may respond by suspending, delaying or reducing their discretionary spending. A suspension, delay or reduction in discretionary spending could adversely affect revenue. Accordingly, our ability to increase or maintain revenue and earnings could be adversely affected to the extent that relevant economic environments decline. Such weak economic conditions may also inhibit our expansion into new European and other markets. We currently are unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects.\nOn June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which British citizens approved an exit from the European Union (the \"E.U.\"), commonly referred to as Brexit.\u201d As a result of the referendum, the global markets and currencies have been adversely impacted, including a sharp decline in the value of the U.K. Pound Sterling as compared to the U.S. dollar. Volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the E.U. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on us will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations. Although it is unknown what the result of those negotiations will be, it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results. On March 29, 2017, the U.K. invoked Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is the first step of the U.K.'s formal exit from the E.U. This started the two-year window in which the U.K. and the European Commission can negotiate future terms for imports, exports, taxes, employment, immigration and other areas, ending in the exit of the U.K. from the E.U.\nThe current President of the U.S. has expressed apprehension towards existing trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and suggested that the U.S. would renegotiate or withdraw from these agreements. He also raised the possibility of significantly increasing tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly from China and Mexico. On January 23, 2017, the President of the U.S. signed a presidential memorandum to withdraw the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This and the other proposed actions, if implemented, could adversely affect our business because we sell imported products.\nII-3\nResults of Operations\nQVC's operating results were as follows: Table 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below)\n</td> <td>5,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating\n</td> <td>601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative, excluding stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>714\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA\n</td> <td>1,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization\n</td> <td>364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>454\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>1,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (expense) income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in losses of investee\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains on financial instruments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(214\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(210\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(208\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency (loss) gain\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(223\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(176\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(224\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>1,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>(152\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(385\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(389\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>662\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>(46\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to QVC, Inc. stockholder\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>628\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet revenue\nNet revenue by segment was as follows: Table 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>QVC-U.S.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>QVC-International\n</td> <td>2,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated QVC\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nQVC's consolidated net revenue increased 1.0% and decreased 0.7% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The 2017 increase of $89 million in net revenue was primarily comprised of an increase of $405 million due to a 4.2% increase in units sold. This was primarily offset by a 2.3% decrease in average selling price per unit (\"ASP\") attributing $237 million, $33 million due to unfavorable foreign currency rates, a decrease of $27 million in shipping and handling revenue, a $15 million decrease in miscellaneous income and an increase of $4 million in estimated product returns.\nThe 2016 decrease of $61 million in net revenue was primarily due to a 3.9% decrease in ASP attributing $393 million and a $17 million decrease in shipping and handling revenue in constant currency. The decrease was offset by a 2.4% increase in units shipped attributing $237 million, a decrease of $105 million in estimated product returns and a $6 million increase primarily related to product sales with zulily.\nII-4\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the changes in revenue and expenses were affected by changes in the exchange rates for the Japanese Yen, the Euro and the U.K. Pound Sterling. In the event the U.S. Dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies in the future, QVC's revenue and operating cash flow will be negatively affected. Our product margins may continue to be under pressure due to the devaluation of foreign currencies and we will attempt to reduce our exposure through pricing and vendor negotiations, as Brexit negotiations progress.\nIn discussing our operating results, the term \"currency exchange rates\" refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the prior period's currency exchange rates. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. When we refer to \"constant currency operating results\", this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to understand better QVC's underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe percentage change in net revenue for QVC's segments in U.S. Dollars and in constant currency was as follows: Table 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Foreign Currency Exchange Impact\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant Currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Foreign Currency Exchange Impact\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant Currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>QVC-U.S.\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>QVC-International\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2017, QVC-U.S. net revenue increase was primarily due to a 3.7% increase in units shipped and a decrease in estimated product returns. This increase was offset by a 2.9% decrease in ASP, a $32 million decrease in shipping and handling revenue and a $14 million decrease in miscellaneous income. QVC-U.S. experienced shipped sales growth in all categories except jewelry. The decrease in estimated product returns was primarily due to an overall lower return rate across all product categories except jewelry. The decrease in net shipping and handling revenue was a result of a decrease in shipping and handling revenue per unit from promotional offers. QVC-International net revenue growth in constant currency was primarily due to a 5.0% increase in units shipped, driven by increases in Japan, Germany, France and the U.K. offset by a decrease in units shipped in Italy. There was a $5 million increase in shipping and handling revenue, primarily driven by Japan. This was offset by a decrease of 1.0% in ASP, primarily driven in Japan and Germany offset by increases in Italy and the U.K. and a $20 million increase in estimated product returns, driven by all markets except Japan. QVC-International experienced shipped sales growth in constant currency in all categories except electronics and jewelry.\nIn 2016, QVC-U.S. net revenue decline was primarily due to a 5.5% decrease in ASP and 4.0% decrease in shipping and handling revenue. The decline was offset by a 2.3% increase in units shipped and a decrease in estimated product returns. QVC-U.S. experienced shipped sales declines in jewelry, electronics and beauty with growth in apparel, home and accessories. The decrease in net shipping and handling revenue was primarily due to the decrease in shipping and handling rates per unit from promotional offers. The decrease in estimated product returns was primarily due to a decrease in the overall lower return rate across all product categories and sales. QVC-International net revenue growth in constant currency was primarily due to a 2.5% increase in units shipped, driven mainly in Germany and the U.K. offset by the increase in estimated product returns, driven primarily by product returns in Germany. QVC-International experienced shipped sales growth in constant currency in all categories except jewelry and apparel.\nCost of goods sold (excluding depreciation and amortization)\nQVC's cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue remained consistent at 63.8% for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and was 63.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The slight increase in the cost of goods sold percentage in 2016 was primarily due to decreased product margins and increased freight costs in the U.S. associated with the increases in units shipped partially offset by a favorable inventory obsolescence provision in the U.S.\nOperating expenses\nQVC's operating expenses are principally comprised of commissions, order processing and customer service expenses, credit card processing fees and telecommunications expenses. Operating expenses decreased $5 million or 0.8% and decreased $1 million or 0.2% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nII-5\nThe decrease in 2017 was primarily due to favorable exchange rates. The slight decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower telecommunication expense offset by increased commissions expense. The decrease in telecommunication expense was primarily due to lower phone and network rates in the U.S. The increase in commissions expense was primarily due to increases internationally offset by a decrease in sales in the U.S.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (excluding stock-based compensation) (\"SG&A expenses\")\nQVC's SG&A expenses include personnel, information technology, provision for doubtful accounts, credit card income, production costs and marketing and advertising expenses. Such expenses decreased $21 million, and decreased to 7.7% of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year and decreased $18 million, and decreased to 8.0% of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year as a result of a variety of factors.\nThe decrease in 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense of $35 million, a decrease in severance expense of $13 million, $4 million from favorable foreign currency rates and a $6 million increase in credit card income offset by an increase in bonus expense of $33 million and a $4 million increase in marketing expenses. The decrease in bad debt expense was primarily related to lower default rates associated with the Easy-Pay program in the U.S. The increase in credit card income was due to the favorable economics of the QVC-branded credit card (\"Q card\") portfolio in the U.S. The increase in marketing expenses was primarily due to an increase in the investment made to eMarketing partially offset by discontinuing the naming rights to the Chiba Marine Stadium in Japan.\nThe decrease in 2016 was primarily related to reduced personnel costs of $63 million and an increase of credit card income of $8 million which was offset by increases in bad debt expense of $25 million, software expense of $13 million, franchise tax expense of $10 million and external services of $8 million. The decrease in personnel costs was primarily due to a decrease in bonuses and benefits in the U.S. and severance. The increase in credit card income was due to the favorable economics and usage of the Q card portfolio in the U.S. The increase in bad debt expense was primarily related to an increase in U.S. Easy-Pay sales penetration and default rates. The increase in software expense was mainly due to an increase in software licensing and software maintenance. The increase in franchise tax expense was mainly due to a favorable franchise tax reserve adjustment related to an audit settlement in 2015 which was not experienced in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in external services was primarily due to internal control enhancements and the establishment of a global business service center located in Krakow, Poland.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation includes compensation related to options and restricted stock granted to certain officers and employees. QVC recorded $31 million, $32 million and $31 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nII-6\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization consisted of the following: Table 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Affiliate agreements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer relationships\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition related amortization\n</td> <td>210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and equipment\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software amortization\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Channel placement amortization and related expenses\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>588\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, acquisition related amortization expense decreased primarily due to the end of the useful lives of certain affiliate agreements and customer relationships established at the time of Liberty's acquisition of QVC in 2003. This was offset by an increase in channel placement amortization related to the addition of Beauty iQ in the U.S. The increase in depreciation related to the additions at the California distribution center. For the year ended December 31, 2016, depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to expense related to the additions at the California distribution center and new website functionality.\nEquity in losses of investee\nThe losses were associated with our joint venture in China that is accounted for as an equity method investment.\nGains on financial instruments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, QVC entered into a three-year interest rate swap arrangement with a notional amount of $125 million to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with interest payments related to its variable rate debt. The swap arrangement does not qualify as a cash flow hedge under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\" or \"U.S. GAAP\"). Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap are reflected in gain on financial instruments in our consolidated statement of operations. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of the swap instrument was in a net asset position of approximately $2 million which was included in other noncurrent assets. A 1% change in the one-month U.S. LIBOR rate (floating portion of the interest rate swap) will result in a change in the value of the swap instrument of less than $2 million.\nInterest expense, net\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, consolidated net interest expense, increased $4 million and $2 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The increase in net interest expense in 2017 is due to higher average interest rates compared to the previous year, partially offset by lower average debt balances outstanding under the credit agreement. The slight increase in net interest expense in 2016 is due to higher average debt balances partially offset by the lower interest rates.\nForeign currency gain\nCertain loans between QVC and its subsidiaries are deemed to be short-term in nature, and accordingly, the translation of these loans is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. The change in foreign currency gain was also due to variances in interest and operating payables balances between QVC and its international subsidiaries denominated in the currency of the subsidiary and the effects of currency exchange rate changes on those balances.\nII-7\nIncome taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 13.5%, 37.5% and 37.0% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The rates have historically differed from the U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to state tax expense. The effective tax rate decreased in 2017 mainly due to the impact of the federal tax rate reduction under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( the Act\u201d) which was enacted in December 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects the future reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Act, and resulted in the Company reporting an income tax benefit of $285 million (25% reduction of the effective rate). This benefit resulted from the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities related to non-current intangible assets that will reverse at the new 21% rate. An entity is required to reflect the effects of changes in tax laws or rates in income from continuing operations in the interim period that includes the enactment date.\nThe effective tax rate increased during 2016 over 2015 due to a change in Federal tax law relating to foreign exchange gains and losses in connection to foreign branches, which was partially offset by a change in the accounting treatment of share based payments.\nAdjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted OIBDA\")\nQVC defines Adjusted OIBDA as net revenue less cost of goods sold, operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding stock-based compensation). QVC's chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate the businesses and make decisions about allocating resources among the businesses. QVC believes that this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of the businesses, including the ability to service debt and fund capital expenditures. In addition, this measure allows QVC to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and perform benchmarking among its businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. This measure of performance excludes such costs as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation that are included in the measurement of operating income pursuant to U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe primary material limitations associated with the use of Adjusted OIBDA as compared to GAAP results are (i) it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in the industry, and (ii) it excludes financial information that some may consider important in evaluating QVC's performance. QVC compensates for these limitations by providing disclosure of the difference between Adjusted OIBDA and GAAP results, including providing a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to GAAP results, to enable investors to perform their own analysis of QVC's operating results. Refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to income before income taxes.\nSeasonality\nQVC's business is seasonal due to a higher volume of sales in the fourth calendar quarter related to year-end holiday shopping. In recent years, QVC has earned, on average, between 22% and 24% of its revenue in each of the first three quarters of the year and between 30% and 32% of its revenue in the fourth quarter of the year.\nFinancial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nHistorically, QVC's primary sources of cash have been cash provided by operating activities and borrowings. In general, QVC uses this cash to fund its operations, make capital purchases, make payments to Liberty, make interest payments and minimize QVC's outstanding senior secured credit facility balance.\nAs of December 31, 2017, substantially all of QVC's cash and cash equivalents were invested in AAA rated money market funds and time deposits with banks rated equal to or above A.\nII-8\nSenior Secured Notes\nAll of QVC's senior secured notes are secured by the capital stock of QVC and certain of its subsidiaries and have equal priority to the senior secured credit facility. The interest on all of QVC's senior secured notes is payable semi-annually.\n3.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2019\nOn March 18, 2014, QVC issued $400 million principal amount of 3.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2019 at an issue price of 99.828%. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used to repay indebtedness under QVC's senior secured credit facility and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n5.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2022\nOn July 2, 2012, QVC issued $500 million principal amount of 5.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 at par. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used to repay indebtedness under QVC's senior secured credit facility and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n4.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2023\nOn March 18, 2013, QVC issued $750 million principal amount of 4.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 at an issue price of 99.968%. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used to reduce the outstanding principal of previously outstanding notes and the senior secured credit facility, as well as for general corporate purposes.\n4.85% Senior Secured Notes due 2024\nOn March 18, 2014, QVC issued $600 million principal amount of 4.85% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 at an issue price of 99.927%. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used to repay indebtedness under QVC's senior secured credit facility and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n4.45% Senior Secured Notes due 2025\nOn August 21, 2014, QVC issued $600 million principal amount of 4.45% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 at an issue price of 99.860%. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used for the redemption of previously outstanding notes, for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n5.45% Senior Secured Notes due 2034\nOn August 21, 2014, QVC issued $400 million principal amount of 5.45% Senior Secured Notes due 2034 at an issue price of 99.784%. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used for the redemption of previously outstanding notes, for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n5.95% Senior Secured Notes due 2043\nOn March 18, 2013, QVC issued $300 million principal amount of 5.95% Senior Secured Notes due 2043 at an issue price of 99.973%. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used to reduce the principal of previously outstanding notes and the senior secured credit facility, as well as for general corporate purposes.\nII-9\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nOn June 23, 2016, QVC entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with zulily as borrowers (collectively, the Borrowers\u201d) which is a multi-currency facility that provides for a $2.65 billion revolving credit facility with a $300 million sub-limit for standby letters of credit and $1.5 billion of uncommitted incremental revolving loan commitments or incremental term loans. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement includes a $400 million tranche that may be borrowed by the Company or zulily with an additional $50 million sub-limit for standby letters of credit. The remaining $2.25 billion and any incremental loans may be borrowed only by the Company. Borrowings that are alternate base rate loans will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the base rate plus a margin that varies between 0.25% and 0.75% depending on the Borrowers' combined ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (the Combined Consolidated Leverage Ratio\u201d). Borrowings that are LIBOR loans will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the applicable LIBOR rate plus a margin that varies between 1.25% and 1.75% depending on the Borrowers' Combined Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Because the calculation of the consolidated leverage ratio was revised to include zulily, the effective interest rate margins, on the date that the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement was entered into, decreased from the interest rate margins under the previous bank credit facility. Each loan may be prepaid at any time and from time to time without penalty other than customary breakage costs. No mandatory prepayments will be required other than when borrowings and letter of credit usage exceed availability; provided that, if zulily ceases to be controlled by Liberty, all of its loans must be repaid and its letters of credit cash collateralized. The facility matures on June 23, 2021, except that $140 million of the $2.25 billion commitment available to QVC matures on March 9, 2020. Any amounts prepaid on the revolving facility may be reborrowed. Payment of loans may be accelerated following certain customary events of default.\nQVC had $877 million available under the terms of the senior secured credit facility at December 31, 2017, including the portion available under the $400 million tranche that zulily may also borrow on. The interest rate on the senior secured credit facility was 3.0% at December 31, 2017.\nThe purpose of the amendment was to, among other things, extend the maturity of our senior secured credit facility, provide zulily the opportunity to borrow on the senior secured credit facility(see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements) and lower the interest rate on borrowings. The payment and performance of the Borrowers' obligations under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are guaranteed by each of QVC's Material Domestic Subsidiaries (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). Further, the borrowings under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are secured, pari passu with QVC's existing notes, by a pledge of all of QVC's equity interests. In addition, the payment and performance of the Borrowers' obligations with respect to the $400 million tranche available to both QVC and zulily are also guaranteed by zulily and secured by a pledge of all of zulily's equity interests.\nThe Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including certain restrictions on the Company and zulily and each of their respective restricted subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions) with respect to, among other things: incurring additional indebtedness; creating liens on property or assets; making certain loans or investments; selling or disposing of assets; paying certain dividends and other restricted payments; dissolving, consolidating or merging; entering into certain transactions with affiliates; entering into sale or leaseback transactions; restricting subsidiary distributions; and limiting the Company's consolidated leverage ratio and the Borrowers' Combined Consolidated Leverage Ratio.\nOther Debt Related Information\nOn April 15, 2015, QVC completed the redemption of previously outstanding senior secured notes which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of $21 million. No such transaction occurred in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nQVC was in compliance with all of its debt covenants at December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, there were no significant changes to QVC's debt credit ratings.\nThe weighted average interest rate applicable to all of the outstanding debt (excluding capital and build to suit leases) prior to amortization of bond discounts and related debt issuance costs was 4.2% as of December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, outstanding trade letters of credit totaled $16 million and $18 million, respectively.\nII-10\nThere are no restrictions under the debt agreements on QVC's ability to pay dividends or make other restricted payments if QVC is not in default on its senior secured notes or senior secured credit facility, and QVC's consolidated leverage ratio, and a combined consolidated leverage ratio for both QVC and zulily, would be no greater than 3.5 to 1.0. As a result, Liberty will, in many instances, be permitted to rely on QVC's cash flow for servicing Liberty's debt and for other purposes, including repurchases of Liberty's common stock, or to fund acquisitions or other operational requirements of Liberty and its subsidiaries. These events may increase accumulated deficit or require QVC to borrow under the senior secured credit facility, increasing QVC's leverage and decreasing liquidity. QVC has made significant distributions to Liberty in the past. See Item 1. Business - Liberty Relationship and Related Party Transactions.\u201d\nAdditional Cash Flow Information\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, QVC's primary uses of cash were $2,278 million of principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations, $866 million of dividends to Liberty, $202 million of capital and television distribution rights expenditures, $40 million in dividend payments from QVC-Japan to Mitsui and $16 million of other financing activities. These uses of cash were funded primarily with $2,162 million of principal borrowings from the senior secured credit facility and $1,202 million of cash provided by operating activities. As of December 31, 2017, QVC's cash and cash equivalents balance (excluding restricted cash) was $260 million.\nThe change in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the previous year was primarily due to an increase in net income partially offset by a decrease in deferred taxes. The decrease in deferred tax liability is mainly due a reduction of the corporate tax rate as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Cash provided by operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nAs of December 31, 2017, $204 million of the $260 million in cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries. Cash in foreign subsidiaries is available for domestic purposes with no significant tax consequences upon repatriation to the U.S. QVC accrues taxes on the unremitted earnings of its international subsidiaries. Approximately 79% of this foreign cash balance was that of QVC-Japan. QVC owns 60% of QVC-Japan and shares all profits and losses with the 40% minority interest holder, Mitsui. We believe that we currently have appropriate legal structures in place to repatriate foreign cash as tax efficiently as possible and meet the business needs of QVC.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, QVC's primary uses of cash were $1,733 million of principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations, $703 million of dividends to Liberty, $217 million of capital and television distribution rights expenditures, $39 million in dividend payments from QVC-Japan to Mitsui and $9 million of other financing activities. These uses of cash were funded primarily with $1,505 million of principal borrowings from the senior secured credit facility and $1,178 million of cash provided by operating activities. As of December 31, 2016, QVC's cash and cash equivalents balance (excluding restricted cash) was $284 million.\nThe change in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the previous year was primarily due to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, QVC's primary uses of cash were $2,177 million of principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations, $1,485 million of dividends to Liberty, $287 million of capital and cable and satellite television distribution rights expenditures, $36 million in dividend payments from QVC-Japan to Mitsui, $18 million of bond premium fees and $15 million of other financing activities. These uses of cash were funded primarily with $2,974 million of principal borrowings from the senior secured credit facility and $1,028 million of cash provided by operating activities. As of December 31, 2015, QVC's cash and cash equivalents balance (excluding restricted cash) was $327 million.\nOther\nCapital expenditures spending in 2018 is expected to be between $180 and $230 million.\nOn July 2, 2015, QVC entered into a lease (the Lease\u201d) for a new California distribution center. Pursuant to the Lease, the landlord built an approximately one million square foot rental building in Ontario, California (the Premises\u201d), and thereafter leased the Premises to QVC as its new California distribution center for an initial term of 15 years. Under the Lease, QVC is required to pay an initial base rent of approximately $6 million per year, increasing to approximately $8 million per year by the final year of the initial term, as well as all real estate taxes and other building operating costs. QVC also has an option to extend the term of the Lease for up to two consecutive terms of 10 years each.\nII-11\nQVC has the right to purchase the Premises and related land from the landlord by entering into an amended and restated agreement at any time during the twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth months of the Lease's initial term, which will occur in June and July of 2018, with a $10 million initial payment and annual payments of $12 million over a term of 13 years.\nThe Company concluded that it was the deemed owner (for accounting purposes only) of the Premises during the construction period under build to suit lease accounting. Building construction began in July of 2015. During the construction period, the Company recorded estimated project construction costs incurred by the landlord as a projects in progress asset and a corresponding long-term liability in \"Property and equipment, net\" and \"Other long-term liabilities,\" respectively, on its consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the Company paid for normal tenant improvements and certain structural improvements and recorded these amounts as part of the projects in progress asset. Upon completion of construction, the long-term liability was reclassified to debt. The Company incurred construction costs of $89 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. No such cost were incurred for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOn August 29, 2016, the California distribution center officially opened. The Company evaluated whether the Lease met the criteria for \"sale-leaseback\" treatment under U.S. GAAP and concluded that it did not. Therefore, the Company treats the Lease as a financing obligation and lease payments will be attributed to: (1) a reduction of the principal financing obligation; (2) imputed interest expense; and (3) land lease expense representing an imputed cost to lease the underlying land of the Premises. In addition, the building asset will be depreciated over its estimated useful life of 20 years. Although the Company did not begin making monthly lease payments pursuant to the Lease until February 2017, the portion of the lease obligations allocated to the land has been treated for accounting purposes as an operating lease that commenced in 2015. If the Company does not exercise its right to purchase the Premises and related land, the Company will derecognize both the net book values of the asset and the financing obligation at the conclusion of the lease term.\nRefer to the chart under the \"Off-balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\" section below for additional information concerning the amount and timing of expected future payments under QVC's contractual obligations at December 31, 2017.\nQVC has contingent liabilities related to legal and tax proceedings and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Although it is reasonably possible QVC may incur losses upon the conclusion of such matters, an estimate of any loss or range of loss cannot be made. In the opinion of management, it is expected that amounts, if any, that may be required to satisfy such contingencies will not be material in relation to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nInformation concerning the amount and timing of required payments, both accrued and off-balance sheet, under our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 is summarized below: Table 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments (2)\n</td> <td>214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations (including imputed interest)\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Build to suit lease\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations and other (3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Amounts exclude capital lease obligations and the issue discounts on the 3.125%, 4.375%, 4.85%, 4.45%, 5.45% and 5.95% Senior Secured Notes. Additionally, the presentation assumes there is no amount outstanding on the $140 million commitment under our senior secured credit facility that matures on March 9, 2020.\n(2) Amounts (i) are based on the terms of QVC's senior secured credit facility and senior secured notes, (ii) assume the interest rates on the floating rate debt remain constant at the rates in effect as of December 31, 2017, (iii) assume that our existing debt is repaid at maturity and (iv) exclude capital and build to suit lease obligations.\n(3) Amounts include open purchase orders for inventory and non-inventory purchases along with other contractual obligations.\nII-12\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. This new guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08 which clarifies principal versus agent considerations, in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10 which clarifies the identification of performance obligations and the implementation guidance for licensing, and in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12 which clarifies assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. The updated guidance also requires additional disclosures regarding the nature, timing and uncertainty of the Company's revenue transactions. The Company will adopt the accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018 with a cumulative adjustment that will increase retained earnings approximately $14 million using the modified transition method. The Company has completed their review of the applicable ASU and has concluded it will recognize revenue at the time of shipment to its customers consistent with when title passes. This is a change from the current practice whereby the Company recognizes revenue at the time of delivery to the customers and deferred revenue is recorded to account for the shipments in-transit. The Company has also concluded that it will continue to act as principal in certain vendor arrangements and will recognize credit card income for its QVC-branded credit card as part of net revenue. At the current time, the credit card income is included as an offset to selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, the Company's balance sheet presentation of its sales return reserve will change to present a separate return asset and liability, instead of the net presentation currently used. The Company will also elect the practical expedient to not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component when its payment terms are less than one year, as well as the practical expedient to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price sales and similar taxes collected from customers.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. The new principle is part of the FASB's simplification initiative and applies to entities that measure inventory using a method other than last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") or the retail inventory method. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2017, and there was no significant effect of the standard on its financial reporting.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Statements - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which requires equity investments with readily determinable fair values (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income and simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. The new standard is effective for the Company for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company plans to adopt this standard during the first quarter of 2018 and does not expect that the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which revises the accounting related to lessee accounting. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. The new lease guidance also simplifies the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019 and should be applied through a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. While the Company is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on its ongoing financial reporting, it expects that the operating leases listed in note 9 - Leases to the accompanying consolidated financial statements will be recognized as right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets upon adoption of the new standard.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which addresses eight specific cash flow issues to reduce the diversity in practice for appropriate classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt this ASU beginning January 1, 2018 and does not expect that the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nII-13\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires an entity to recognize at the transaction date the income tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers other than inventory. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this standard during the first quarter of 2018 and does not expect that the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this standard during the first quarter of 2018 and does not expect that the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the measurement for impairment by calculating the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the reporting unit. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard during the fourth quarter of 2017 and there was no significant effect of the standard on its financial reporting.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting, to provide clarity to which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. The amendments in this update are effective for all entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this standard during the first quarter of 2018 and does not expect that the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires QVC to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates include, but are not limited to, sales returns, uncollectible receivables, inventory obsolescence, depreciable lives of fixed assets, internally developed software, valuation of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, and income taxes. QVC bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that QVC believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In addition, as circumstances change, QVC may revise the basis of its estimates accordingly.\nGoodwill and long-lived assets\nQVC's long-lived asset valuations are primarily comprised of the annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangibles, such as trademarks, and the evaluation of the recoverability of other long-lived assets upon certain triggering events. If the carrying value of long-lived assets exceeds their undiscounted cash flows, QVC is required to write the carrying value down to the fair value. Any such writedown is included in depreciation/amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. A high degree of judgment is required to estimate the fair value of the long-lived assets. QVC may use quoted market prices, prices for similar assets, present value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates. QVC may need to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to implement these valuation techniques. Due to the high degree of judgment involved in estimation techniques, any value ultimately derived from the long-lived assets may differ from the estimate of fair value. As both of QVC's operating segments have long-lived assets, this critical accounting estimate affects the financial position and results of operations of each segment.\nII-14\nQVC utilizes a qualitative assessment for determining whether step one of the goodwill impairment analysis is necessary. The accounting guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether an impairment exists. In evaluating goodwill on a qualitative basis, QVC reviews the business performance of each reporting unit and evaluates other relevant factors as identified in the relevant accounting guidance to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indicated impairment exists for any of our reporting units. A reporting unit is defined in accounting guidance in accordance with U.S. GAAP as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (also known as a component). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. The Company considers whether there were any negative macroeconomic conditions, industry specific conditions, market changes, increased competition, increased costs in doing business, management challenges and the legal environments, and how these factors might impact country specific performance in future periods.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, QVC performed only qualitative assessments as it was more likely than not that the carrying values exceeded the fair values for each of the reporting units.\nThe accounting guidance also permits entities to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If the qualitative assessment supports that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, exceeds its fair value, then a quantitative assessment is performed. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nThere were no goodwill and other intangible asset impairments in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>QVC-U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>QVC-Germany\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>QVC-Japan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>QVC-U.K.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>QVC-Italy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance as of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exchange rate fluctuations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance as of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>4,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exchange rate fluctuations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance as of December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRetail related adjustments and allowances\nQVC records adjustments and allowances for sales returns, inventory obsolescence and uncollectible receivables. Each of these adjustments is estimated based on historical experience. Sales returns are calculated as a percent of sales and are netted against revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, sales returns represented 18.1%, 18.3% and 19.1% of gross product revenue, respectively. The inventory obsolescence reserve is calculated as a percent of inventory at the end of a reporting period based on, among other factors, the average inventory balance for the preceding twelve months and historical experience with liquidated inventory. The change in the reserve is included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2017, inventory was $1,019 million, which was net of the obsolescence adjustment of $92 million. At December 31, 2016, inventory was $950 million, which was net of the obsolescence adjustment of $76 million. The allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated as a percent of accounts receivable at the end of a reporting period, and it is based on historical experience, with the change in such allowance being recorded as a provision for doubtful accounts in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2017, trade accounts receivable were $1,388 million, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of $91 million. At December 31, 2016, trade accounts receivable were $1,246 million, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of $97 million. Each of these adjustments requires management judgment. Actual results could differ from management's estimates.\nII-15\nAccounting for income taxes\nQVC is required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the financial statements or tax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which QVC operates. This process requires management to make judgments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact of the various agreements and transactions into which QVC enters. Based on these judgments, QVC may record tax reserves or adjustments to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets to reflect the expected realizability of future tax benefits. Tax benefits from uncertain tax positions may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which QVC operates, QVC's inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year's liability by taxing authorities. These changes could have a significant impact on QVC's financial position.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information concerning our results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.\nOverview\nQVC, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (\"QVC\" or the \"Company\") is a retailer of a wide range of consumer products, which are marketed and sold primarily by merchandise-focused televised shopping programs, the Internet and mobile applications.\nIn the United States (\"U.S.\"), QVC's televised shopping programs, including live and recorded content, are broadcast across multiple channels nationally on a full-time basis, including QVC, QVC2 and Beauty iQ. The Company's U.S. programming is also available on QVC.com, QVC's U.S. website; mobile applications via streaming video; over-the-air broadcasters; and over-the-top content platforms (Roku, Apple TV, Facebook, etc.).\nQVC believes that the Company's digital platforms complement the Company's televised shopping programs by allowing consumers to purchase a wide assortment of goods offered on QVC's televised programs, as well as other products that are available only on the Company's digital platforms. The Company views e-commerce as a natural extension of the Company's business, allowing the Company to stream live video and offer on-demand video segments of items recently presented live on QVC's televised programs. The Company's digital platforms allow shoppers to browse, research, compare and perform targeted searches for products, control the order-entry process and conveniently access their QVC account.\nQVC's international televised shopping programs, including live and recorded content, are distributed to households outside of the U.S., primarily in Germany, Austria, Japan, the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), the Republic of Ireland, Italy and France. In some of the countries where QVC operates, QVC's televised shopping programs are broadcast across multiple QVC channels: QVC Beauty & Style and QVC2 in Germany and QVC Beauty, QVC Extra and QVC Style in the U.K. The programming created for most of these markets is also available via streaming video on QVC's digital platforms. QVC's international business employs product sourcing teams who select products tailored to the interests of each local market.\nThe Company's Japanese operations (\"QVC-Japan\") are conducted through a joint venture with Mitsui & Co., LTD (\"Mitsui\"). QVC-Japan is owned 60% by the Company and 40% by Mitsui. The Company and Mitsui share in all profits and losses based on their respective ownership interests. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, QVC-Japan paid dividends to Mitsui of $40 million, $39 million and $36 million, respectively.\nThe Company also has a joint venture with CNR Media Group, formerly known as China Broadcasting Corporation, a limited liability company owned by China National Radio (''CNR''). The Company owns a 49% interest in a CNR subsidiary, CNR Home Shopping Co., Ltd. (''CNRS''). CNRS operates a retail business in China through a shopping television channel with an associated website. This joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment recorded as equity in losses of investee in the consolidated statements of operations.\nII-1\nThe Company is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive Corporation (\"Liberty\"), which owns interests in a broad range of digital commerce businesses, and is attributed to Liberty's QVC Group. The QVC Group common stock (Nasdaq: QVCA and QVCB) tracks the assets and liabilities of the QVC Group. The QVC Group tracks the Company, zulily, llc (\"zulily\") and HSN, Inc. (\"HSN\"), cash and certain liabilities. On April 4, 2017, Liberty entered into an agreement with General Communication, Inc. (\"GCI\"), an Alaska corporation, and Liberty Interactive LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty, whereby Liberty will acquire GCI through a reorganization in which certain assets and liabilities attributed to Liberty's Ventures Group will be contributed to GCI in exchange for a controlling interest in GCI. Liberty will then effect a tax-free separation of its controlling interest in the combined company. The transactions are expected to be consummated on March 9, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Simultaneous with that closing, the QVC Group common stock will become the only outstanding common stock of Liberty, and thus QVC Group common stock will cease to function as tracking stock and will effectively become regular common stock. In addition, Liberty will be renamed Qurate Retail Group, Inc., with QVC, HSN and zulily as wholly-owned subsidiaries. On December 29, 2017, Liberty completed the acquisition of the remaining 62% ownership interest of HSN in an all-stock transaction. HSN is attributed to the QVC Group. The QVC Group does not represent a separate legal entity; rather, it represents those businesses, assets and liabilities that are attributed to that group. HSN is not included in the results of operations or financial position of QVC presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nOn October 1, 2015, Liberty acquired all of the outstanding shares of zulily and QVC declared and paid a dividend to Liberty in the amount of $910 million with funds drawn from the Company's credit facility to support Liberty's purchase. zulily is an online retailer offering customers a fun and entertaining shopping experience with a fresh selection of new product styles launched each day for a limited time period. zulily is attributed to the QVC Group and the Company believes that its business is complementary to the Company. zulily is not part of the results of operations or financial position of QVC presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2017, QVC and zulily engaged in multiple transactions relating to sales, sourcing of merchandise, marketing initiatives, business advisory services and software development. The gross value of these transactions totaled $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and less than $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which did not have a material impact on QVC's financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.\nOn June 23, 2016, QVC amended and restated its senior secured credit facility (the \"Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\") increasing the revolving credit facility from $2.25 billion to $2.65 billion as explained further in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement includes a $400 million tranche that may be borrowed by QVC or zulily. Under the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, QVC and zulily are jointly and severally liable for all amounts borrowed on the $400 million tranche. In accordance with the accounting guidance for obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements, QVC will record a liability for amounts it has borrowed under the credit facility plus any additional amount it expects to repay on behalf of zulily. As of December 31, 2017, there was $267 million borrowed by zulily on the $400 million tranche of the senior secured credit facility, none of which the Company expects to repay on behalf of zulily.\nQVC engages with CommerceHub, Inc. (\"CommerceHub\") which was an approximately 99% owned subsidiary of Liberty prior to the completion of its spin-off from Liberty in July 2016, to handle communications between QVC and certain of its vendors for drop ship sales and returns. CommerceHub is not part of the results of operations or financial position of QVC presented in our consolidated financial statements. During each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, QVC paid CommerceHub for the related services totaling less than $3 million, which did not have a material impact on QVC's financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. On July 22, 2016, Liberty completed the spin-off of CommerceHub. As a result, Liberty and CommerceHub are now separate publicly traded companies.\nStrategies and challenges of business units\nQVC's goal is to become the preeminent global multimedia shopping community for people who love to shop, and to offer a shopping experience that is as much about entertainment and enrichment as it is about buying. QVC's objective is to provide an integrated shopping experience that utilizes all forms of media including television, the Internet and mobile devices. QVC intends to employ several strategies to achieve these goals and objectives. Among these strategies are to (i) extend the breadth, relevance and exposure of the QVC brand; (ii) source products that represent unique quality and value; (iii) create engaging presentation content in televised programming, mobile and online; (iv) leverage customer loyalty and continue multi-platform expansion; and (v) create a compelling and differentiated customer experience. In addition, QVC expects to expand globally by leveraging its existing systems, infrastructure and skills in other countries around the world.\nII-2\nQVC's future net revenue growth will primarily depend on sales growth from e-commerce and mobile platforms, additions of new customers from households already receiving QVC's television programming and increased spending from existing customers. QVC's future net revenue may also be affected by (i) the willingness of cable television and direct-to-home satellite system operators to continue carrying QVC's programming service; (ii) QVC's ability to maintain favorable channel positioning, which may become more difficult due to governmental action or from distributors converting analog customers to digital; (iii) changes in television viewing habits because of personal video recorders, video-on-demand and Internet video services; and (iv) general economic conditions.\nIn March 2013, QVC-U.S. launched over-the-air broadcasting in designated U.S. markets that can be accessed by any television household with a digital antenna in such markets, regardless of whether it subscribes to a paid television service. This allows QVC-U.S. to reach new customers who previously did not have access to the program through other television platforms. In August 2013, QVC-U.S. launched an additional channel, QVC2, which is being distributed through cable and satellite systems. The channel allows viewers to have access to a broader range of QVC programming options as well as more relevant programming for viewers in differing time zones. In October 2016, QVC-U.S. launched a third channel, Beauty iQ, which is being distributed through satellite and streaming platforms. The channel and supporting platforms are dedicated to a complete beauty shopping experience for customers.\nInternationally, beyond the main QVC channels, QVC-International broadcasts pre-recorded and live shows on additional channels that offer viewers access to a broader range of QVC programming options. These channels include QVC Beauty & Style and QVC2 in Germany and QVC Beauty, QVC Extra and QVC Style in the U.K.\nEconomic uncertainty in various regions of the world in which our subsidiaries and affiliates operate could adversely affect demand for our products and services since a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from discretionary spending by individuals, which typically falls during times of economic instability. Global financial markets have recently experienced disruptions, including increased volatility and diminished liquidity and credit availability. If economic and financial market conditions in the U.S. or other key markets, including Japan and Europe, become uncertain or deteriorate , our customers may respond by suspending, delaying or reducing their discretionary spending. A suspension, delay or reduction in discretionary spending could adversely affect revenue. Accordingly, our ability to increase or maintain revenue and earnings could be adversely affected to the extent that relevant economic environments decline. Such weak economic conditions may also inhibit our expansion into new European and other markets. We currently are unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects.\nOn June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which British citizens approved an exit from the European Union (the \"E.U.\"), commonly referred to as Brexit.\u201d As a result of the referendum, the global markets and currencies have been adversely impacted, including a sharp decline in the value of the U.K. Pound Sterling as compared to the U.S. dollar. Volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the E.U. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on us will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations. Although it is unknown what the result of those negotiations will be, it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results. On March 29, 2017, the U.K. invoked Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is the first step of the U.K.'s formal exit from the E.U. This started the two-year window in which the U.K. and the European Commission can negotiate future terms for imports, exports, taxes, employment, immigration and other areas, ending in the exit of the U.K. from the E.U.\nThe current President of the U.S. has expressed apprehension towards existing trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and suggested that the U.S. would renegotiate or withdraw from these agreements. He also raised the possibility of significantly increasing tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly from China and Mexico. On January 23, 2017, the President of the U.S. signed a presidential memorandum to withdraw the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This and the other proposed actions, if implemented, could adversely affect our business because we sell imported products.\nII-3\nResults of Operations\nQVC's operating results were as follows: Table 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below)\n</td> <td>5,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating\n</td> <td>601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative, excluding stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>714\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA\n</td> <td>1,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization\n</td> <td>364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>454\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>1,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (expense) income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in losses of investee\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains on financial instruments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(214\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(210\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(208\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency (loss) gain\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(223\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(176\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(224\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>1,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>(152\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(385\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(389\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>662\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>(46\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to QVC, Inc. stockholder\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>628\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet revenue\nNet revenue by segment was as follows: Table 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>QVC-U.S.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>QVC-International\n</td> <td>2,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated QVC\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nQVC's consolidated net revenue increased 1.0% and decreased 0.7% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The 2017 increase of $89 million in net revenue was primarily comprised of an increase of $405 million due to a 4.2% increase in units sold. This was primarily offset by a 2.3% decrease in average selling price per unit (\"ASP\") attributing $237 million, $33 million due to unfavorable foreign currency rates, a decrease of $27 million in shipping and handling revenue, a $15 million decrease in miscellaneous income and an increase of $4 million in estimated product returns.\nThe 2016 decrease of $61 million in net revenue was primarily due to a 3.9% decrease in ASP attributing $393 million and a $17 million decrease in shipping and handling revenue in constant currency. The decrease was offset by a 2.4% increase in units shipped attributing $237 million, a decrease of $105 million in estimated product returns and a $6 million increase primarily related to product sales with zulily.\nII-4\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the changes in revenue and expenses were affected by changes in the exchange rates for the Japanese Yen, the Euro and the U.K. Pound Sterling. In the event the U.S. Dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies in the future, QVC's revenue and operating cash flow will be negatively affected. Our product margins may continue to be under pressure due to the devaluation of foreign currencies and we will attempt to reduce our exposure through pricing and vendor negotiations, as Brexit negotiations progress.\nIn discussing our operating results, the term \"currency exchange rates\" refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the prior period's currency exchange rates. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. When we refer to \"constant currency operating results\", this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to understand better QVC's underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe percentage change in net revenue for QVC's segments in U.S. Dollars and in constant currency was as follows: Table 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Foreign Currency Exchange Impact\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant Currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Foreign Currency Exchange Impact\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant Currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>QVC-U.S.\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>QVC-International\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2017, QVC-U.S. net revenue increase was primarily due to a 3.7% increase in units shipped and a decrease in estimated product returns. This increase was offset by a 2.9% decrease in ASP, a $32 million decrease in shipping and handling revenue and a $14 million decrease in miscellaneous income. QVC-U.S. experienced shipped sales growth in all categories except jewelry. The decrease in estimated product returns was primarily due to an overall lower return rate across all product categories except jewelry. The decrease in net shipping and handling revenue was a result of a decrease in shipping and handling revenue per unit from promotional offers. QVC-International net revenue growth in constant currency was primarily due to a 5.0% increase in units shipped, driven by increases in Japan, Germany, France and the U.K. offset by a decrease in units shipped in Italy. There was a $5 million increase in shipping and handling revenue, primarily driven by Japan. This was offset by a decrease of 1.0% in ASP, primarily driven in Japan and Germany offset by increases in Italy and the U.K. and a $20 million increase in estimated product returns, driven by all markets except Japan. QVC-International experienced shipped sales growth in constant currency in all categories except electronics and jewelry.\nIn 2016, QVC-U.S. net revenue decline was primarily due to a 5.5% decrease in ASP and 4.0% decrease in shipping and handling revenue. The decline was offset by a 2.3% increase in units shipped and a decrease in estimated product returns. QVC-U.S. experienced shipped sales declines in jewelry, electronics and beauty with growth in apparel, home and accessories. The decrease in net shipping and handling revenue was primarily due to the decrease in shipping and handling rates per unit from promotional offers. The decrease in estimated product returns was primarily due to a decrease in the overall lower return rate across all product categories and sales. QVC-International net revenue growth in constant currency was primarily due to a 2.5% increase in units shipped, driven mainly in Germany and the U.K. offset by the increase in estimated product returns, driven primarily by product returns in Germany. QVC-International experienced shipped sales growth in constant currency in all categories except jewelry and apparel.\nCost of goods sold (excluding depreciation and amortization)\nQVC's cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue remained consistent at 63.8% for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and was 63.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The slight increase in the cost of goods sold percentage in 2016 was primarily due to decreased product margins and increased freight costs in the U.S. associated with the increases in units shipped partially offset by a favorable inventory obsolescence provision in the U.S.\nOperating expenses\nQVC's operating expenses are principally comprised of commissions, order processing and customer service expenses, credit card processing fees and telecommunications expenses. Operating expenses decreased $5 million or 0.8% and decreased $1 million or 0.2% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nII-5\nThe decrease in 2017 was primarily due to favorable exchange rates. The slight decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower telecommunication expense offset by increased commissions expense. The decrease in telecommunication expense was primarily due to lower phone and network rates in the U.S. The increase in commissions expense was primarily due to increases internationally offset by a decrease in sales in the U.S.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (excluding stock-based compensation) (\"SG&A expenses\")\nQVC's SG&A expenses include personnel, information technology, provision for doubtful accounts, credit card income, production costs and marketing and advertising expenses. Such expenses decreased $21 million, and decreased to 7.7% of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year and decreased $18 million, and decreased to 8.0% of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year as a result of a variety of factors.\nThe decrease in 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense of $35 million, a decrease in severance expense of $13 million, $4 million from favorable foreign currency rates and a $6 million increase in credit card income offset by an increase in bonus expense of $33 million and a $4 million increase in marketing expenses. The decrease in bad debt expense was primarily related to lower default rates associated with the Easy-Pay program in the U.S. The increase in credit card income was due to the favorable economics of the QVC-branded credit card (\"Q card\") portfolio in the U.S. The increase in marketing expenses was primarily due to an increase in the investment made to eMarketing partially offset by discontinuing the naming rights to the Chiba Marine Stadium in Japan.\nThe decrease in 2016 was primarily related to reduced personnel costs of $63 million and an increase of credit card income of $8 million which was offset by increases in bad debt expense of $25 million, software expense of $13 million, franchise tax expense of $10 million and external services of $8 million. The decrease in personnel costs was primarily due to a decrease in bonuses and benefits in the U.S. and severance. The increase in credit card income was due to the favorable economics and usage of the Q card portfolio in the U.S. The increase in bad debt expense was primarily related to an increase in U.S. Easy-Pay sales penetration and default rates. The increase in software expense was mainly due to an increase in software licensing and software maintenance. The increase in franchise tax expense was mainly due to a favorable franchise tax reserve adjustment related to an audit settlement in 2015 which was not experienced in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in external services was primarily due to internal control enhancements and the establishment of a global business service center located in Krakow, Poland.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation includes compensation related to options and restricted stock granted to certain officers and employees. QVC recorded $31 million, $32 million and $31 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nII-6\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization consisted of the following: Table 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Affiliate agreements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer relationships\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition related amortization\n</td> <td>210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and equipment\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software amortization\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Channel placement amortization and related expenses\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>588\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, acquisition related amortization expense decreased primarily due to the end of the useful lives of certain affiliate agreements and customer relationships established at the time of Liberty's acquisition of QVC in 2003. This was offset by an increase in channel placement amortization related to the addition of Beauty iQ in the U.S. The increase in depreciation related to the additions at the California distribution center. For the year ended December 31, 2016, depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to expense related to the additions at the California distribution center and new website functionality.\nEquity in losses of investee\nThe losses were associated with our joint venture in China that is accounted for as an equity method investment.\nGains on financial instruments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, QVC entered into a three-year interest rate swap arrangement with a notional amount of $125 million to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with interest payments related to its variable rate debt. The swap arrangement does not qualify as a cash flow hedge under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\" or \"U.S. GAAP\"). Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap are reflected in gain on financial instruments in our consolidated statement of operations. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of the swap instrument was in a net asset position of approximately $2 million which was included in other noncurrent assets. A 1% change in the one-month U.S. LIBOR rate (floating portion of the interest rate swap) will result in a change in the value of the swap instrument of less than $2 million.\nInterest expense, net\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, consolidated net interest expense, increased $4 million and $2 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The increase in net interest expense in 2017 is due to higher average interest rates compared to the previous year, partially offset by lower average debt balances outstanding under the credit agreement. The slight increase in net interest expense in 2016 is due to higher average debt balances partially offset by the lower interest rates.\nForeign currency gain\nCertain loans between QVC and its subsidiaries are deemed to be short-term in nature, and accordingly, the translation of these loans is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. The change in foreign currency gain was also due to variances in interest and operating payables balances between QVC and its international subsidiaries denominated in the currency of the subsidiary and the effects of currency exchange rate changes on those balances.\nII-7\nIncome taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 13.5%, 37.5% and 37.0% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The rates have historically differed from the U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to state tax expense. The effective tax rate decreased in 2017 mainly due to the impact of the federal tax rate reduction under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( the Act\u201d) which was enacted in December 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects the future reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Act, and resulted in the Company reporting an income tax benefit of $285 million (25% reduction of the effective rate). This benefit resulted from the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities related to non-current intangible assets that will reverse at the new 21% rate. An entity is required to reflect the effects of changes in tax laws or rates in income from continuing operations in the interim period that includes the enactment date.\nThe effective tax rate increased during 2016 over 2015 due to a change in Federal tax law relating to foreign exchange gains and losses in connection to foreign branches, which was partially offset by a change in the accounting treatment of share based payments.\nAdjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted OIBDA\")\nQVC defines Adjusted OIBDA as net revenue less cost of goods sold, operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding stock-based compensation). QVC's chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate the businesses and make decisions about allocating resources among the businesses. QVC believes that this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of the businesses, including the ability to service debt and fund capital expenditures. In addition, this measure allows QVC to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and perform benchmarking among its businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. This measure of performance excludes such costs as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation that are included in the measurement of operating income pursuant to U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe primary material limitations associated with the use of Adjusted OIBDA as compared to GAAP results are (i) it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in the industry, and (ii) it excludes financial information that some may consider important in evaluating QVC's performance. QVC compensates for these limitations by providing disclosure of the difference between Adjusted OIBDA and GAAP results, including providing a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to GAAP results, to enable investors to perform their own analysis of QVC's operating results. Refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to income before income taxes.\nSeasonality\nQVC's business is seasonal due to a higher volume of sales in the fourth calendar quarter related to year-end holiday shopping. In recent years, QVC has earned, on average, between 22% and 24% of its revenue in each of the first three quarters of the year and between 30% and 32% of its revenue in the fourth quarter of the year.\nFinancial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nHistorically, QVC's primary sources of cash have been cash provided by operating activities and borrowings. In general, QVC uses this cash to fund its operations, make capital purchases, make payments to Liberty, make interest payments and minimize QVC's outstanding senior secured credit facility balance.\nAs of December 31, 2017, substantially all of QVC's cash and cash equivalents were invested in AAA rated money market funds and time deposits with banks rated equal to or above A.\nII-8\nSenior Secured Notes\nAll of QVC's senior secured notes are secured by the capital stock of QVC and certain of its subsidiaries and have equal priority to the senior secured credit facility. The interest on all of QVC's senior secured notes is payable semi-annually.\n3.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2019\nOn March 18, 2014, QVC issued $400 million principal amount of 3.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2019 at an issue price of 99.828%. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used to repay indebtedness under QVC's senior secured credit facility and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n5.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2022\nOn July 2, 2012, QVC issued $500 million principal amount of 5.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 at par. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used to repay indebtedness under QVC's senior secured credit facility and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n4.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2023\nOn March 18, 2013, QVC issued $750 million principal amount of 4.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 at an issue price of 99.968%. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used to reduce the outstanding principal of previously outstanding notes and the senior secured credit facility, as well as for general corporate purposes.\n4.85% Senior Secured Notes due 2024\nOn March 18, 2014, QVC issued $600 million principal amount of 4.85% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 at an issue price of 99.927%. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used to repay indebtedness under QVC's senior secured credit facility and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n4.45% Senior Secured Notes due 2025\nOn August 21, 2014, QVC issued $600 million principal amount of 4.45% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 at an issue price of 99.860%. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used for the redemption of previously outstanding notes, for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n5.45% Senior Secured Notes due 2034\nOn August 21, 2014, QVC issued $400 million principal amount of 5.45% Senior Secured Notes due 2034 at an issue price of 99.784%. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used for the redemption of previously outstanding notes, for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n5.95% Senior Secured Notes due 2043\nOn March 18, 2013, QVC issued $300 million principal amount of 5.95% Senior Secured Notes due 2043 at an issue price of 99.973%. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used to reduce the principal of previously outstanding notes and the senior secured credit facility, as well as for general corporate purposes.\nII-9\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nOn June 23, 2016, QVC entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with zulily as borrowers (collectively, the Borrowers\u201d) which is a multi-currency facility that provides for a $2.65 billion revolving credit facility with a $300 million sub-limit for standby letters of credit and $1.5 billion of uncommitted incremental revolving loan commitments or incremental term loans. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement includes a $400 million tranche that may be borrowed by the Company or zulily with an additional $50 million sub-limit for standby letters of credit. The remaining $2.25 billion and any incremental loans may be borrowed only by the Company. Borrowings that are alternate base rate loans will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the base rate plus a margin that varies between 0.25% and 0.75% depending on the Borrowers' combined ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (the Combined Consolidated Leverage Ratio\u201d). Borrowings that are LIBOR loans will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the applicable LIBOR rate plus a margin that varies between 1.25% and 1.75% depending on the Borrowers' Combined Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Because the calculation of the consolidated leverage ratio was revised to include zulily, the effective interest rate margins, on the date that the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement was entered into, decreased from the interest rate margins under the previous bank credit facility. Each loan may be prepaid at any time and from time to time without penalty other than customary breakage costs. No mandatory prepayments will be required other than when borrowings and letter of credit usage exceed availability; provided that, if zulily ceases to be controlled by Liberty, all of its loans must be repaid and its letters of credit cash collateralized. The facility matures on June 23, 2021, except that $140 million of the $2.25 billion commitment available to QVC matures on March 9, 2020. Any amounts prepaid on the revolving facility may be reborrowed. Payment of loans may be accelerated following certain customary events of default.\nQVC had $877 million available under the terms of the senior secured credit facility at December 31, 2017, including the portion available under the $400 million tranche that zulily may also borrow on. The interest rate on the senior secured credit facility was 3.0% at December 31, 2017.\nThe purpose of the amendment was to, among other things, extend the maturity of our senior secured credit facility, provide zulily the opportunity to borrow on the senior secured credit facility(see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements) and lower the interest rate on borrowings. The payment and performance of the Borrowers' obligations under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are guaranteed by each of QVC's Material Domestic Subsidiaries (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). Further, the borrowings under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are secured, pari passu with QVC's existing notes, by a pledge of all of QVC's equity interests. In addition, the payment and performance of the Borrowers' obligations with respect to the $400 million tranche available to both QVC and zulily are also guaranteed by zulily and secured by a pledge of all of zulily's equity interests.\nThe Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including certain restrictions on the Company and zulily and each of their respective restricted subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions) with respect to, among other things: incurring additional indebtedness; creating liens on property or assets; making certain loans or investments; selling or disposing of assets; paying certain dividends and other restricted payments; dissolving, consolidating or merging; entering into certain transactions with affiliates; entering into sale or leaseback transactions; restricting subsidiary distributions; and limiting the Company's consolidated leverage ratio and the Borrowers' Combined Consolidated Leverage Ratio.\nOther Debt Related Information\nOn April 15, 2015, QVC completed the redemption of previously outstanding senior secured notes which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of $21 million. No such transaction occurred in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nQVC was in compliance with all of its debt covenants at December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, there were no significant changes to QVC's debt credit ratings.\nThe weighted average interest rate applicable to all of the outstanding debt (excluding capital and build to suit leases) prior to amortization of bond discounts and related debt issuance costs was 4.2% as of December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, outstanding trade letters of credit totaled $16 million and $18 million, respectively.\nII-10\nThere are no restrictions under the debt agreements on QVC's ability to pay dividends or make other restricted payments if QVC is not in default on its senior secured notes or senior secured credit facility, and QVC's consolidated leverage ratio, and a combined consolidated leverage ratio for both QVC and zulily, would be no greater than 3.5 to 1.0. As a result, Liberty will, in many instances, be permitted to rely on QVC's cash flow for servicing Liberty's debt and for other purposes, including repurchases of Liberty's common stock, or to fund acquisitions or other operational requirements of Liberty and its subsidiaries. These events may increase accumulated deficit or require QVC to borrow under the senior secured credit facility, increasing QVC's leverage and decreasing liquidity. QVC has made significant distributions to Liberty in the past. See Item 1. Business - Liberty Relationship and Related Party Transactions.\u201d\nAdditional Cash Flow Information\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, QVC's primary uses of cash were $2,278 million of principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations, $866 million of dividends to Liberty, $202 million of capital and television distribution rights expenditures, $40 million in dividend payments from QVC-Japan to Mitsui and $16 million of other financing activities. These uses of cash were funded primarily with $2,162 million of principal borrowings from the senior secured credit facility and $1,202 million of cash provided by operating activities. As of December 31, 2017, QVC's cash and cash equivalents balance (excluding restricted cash) was $260 million.\nThe change in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the previous year was primarily due to an increase in net income partially offset by a decrease in deferred taxes. The decrease in deferred tax liability is mainly due a reduction of the corporate tax rate as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Cash provided by operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nAs of December 31, 2017, $204 million of the $260 million in cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries. Cash in foreign subsidiaries is available for domestic purposes with no significant tax consequences upon repatriation to the U.S. QVC accrues taxes on the unremitted earnings of its international subsidiaries. Approximately 79% of this foreign cash balance was that of QVC-Japan. QVC owns 60% of QVC-Japan and shares all profits and losses with the 40% minority interest holder, Mitsui. We believe that we currently have appropriate legal structures in place to repatriate foreign cash as tax efficiently as possible and meet the business needs of QVC.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, QVC's primary uses of cash were $1,733 million of principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations, $703 million of dividends to Liberty, $217 million of capital and television distribution rights expenditures, $39 million in dividend payments from QVC-Japan to Mitsui and $9 million of other financing activities. These uses of cash were funded primarily with $1,505 million of principal borrowings from the senior secured credit facility and $1,178 million of cash provided by operating activities. As of December 31, 2016, QVC's cash and cash equivalents balance (excluding restricted cash) was $284 million.\nThe change in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the previous year was primarily due to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, QVC's primary uses of cash were $2,177 million of principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations, $1,485 million of dividends to Liberty, $287 million of capital and cable and satellite television distribution rights expenditures, $36 million in dividend payments from QVC-Japan to Mitsui, $18 million of bond premium fees and $15 million of other financing activities. These uses of cash were funded primarily with $2,974 million of principal borrowings from the senior secured credit facility and $1,028 million of cash provided by operating activities. As of December 31, 2015, QVC's cash and cash equivalents balance (excluding restricted cash) was $327 million.\nOther\nCapital expenditures spending in 2018 is expected to be between $180 and $230 million.\nOn July 2, 2015, QVC entered into a lease (the Lease\u201d) for a new California distribution center. Pursuant to the Lease, the landlord built an approximately one million square foot rental building in Ontario, California (the Premises\u201d), and thereafter leased the Premises to QVC as its new California distribution center for an initial term of 15 years. Under the Lease, QVC is required to pay an initial base rent of approximately $6 million per year, increasing to approximately $8 million per year by the final year of the initial term, as well as all real estate taxes and other building operating costs. QVC also has an option to extend the term of the Lease for up to two consecutive terms of 10 years each.\nII-11\nQVC has the right to purchase the Premises and related land from the landlord by entering into an amended and restated agreement at any time during the twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth months of the Lease's initial term, which will occur in June and July of 2018, with a $10 million initial payment and annual payments of $12 million over a term of 13 years.\nThe Company concluded that it was the deemed owner (for accounting purposes only) of the Premises during the construction period under build to suit lease accounting. Building construction began in July of 2015. During the construction period, the Company recorded estimated project construction costs incurred by the landlord as a projects in progress asset and a corresponding long-term liability in \"Property and equipment, net\" and \"Other long-term liabilities,\" respectively, on its consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the Company paid for normal tenant improvements and certain structural improvements and recorded these amounts as part of the projects in progress asset. Upon completion of construction, the long-term liability was reclassified to debt. The Company incurred construction costs of $89 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. No such cost were incurred for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOn August 29, 2016, the California distribution center officially opened. The Company evaluated whether the Lease met the criteria for \"sale-leaseback\" treatment under U.S. GAAP and concluded that it did not. Therefore, the Company treats the Lease as a financing obligation and lease payments will be attributed to: (1) a reduction of the principal financing obligation; (2) imputed interest expense; and (3) land lease expense representing an imputed cost to lease the underlying land of the Premises. In addition, the building asset will be depreciated over its estimated useful life of 20 years. Although the Company did not begin making monthly lease payments pursuant to the Lease until February 2017, the portion of the lease obligations allocated to the land has been treated for accounting purposes as an operating lease that commenced in 2015. If the Company does not exercise its right to purchase the Premises and related land, the Company will derecognize both the net book values of the asset and the financing obligation at the conclusion of the lease term.\nRefer to the chart under the \"Off-balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\" section below for additional information concerning the amount and timing of expected future payments under QVC's contractual obligations at December 31, 2017.\nQVC has contingent liabilities related to legal and tax proceedings and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Although it is reasonably possible QVC may incur losses upon the conclusion of such matters, an estimate of any loss or range of loss cannot be made. In the opinion of management, it is expected that amounts, if any, that may be required to satisfy such contingencies will not be material in relation to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nInformation concerning the amount and timing of required payments, both accrued and off-balance sheet, under our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 is summarized below: Table 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments (2)\n</td> <td>214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations (including imputed interest)\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Build to suit lease\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations and other (3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Amounts exclude capital lease obligations and the issue discounts on the 3.125%, 4.375%, 4.85%, 4.45%, 5.45% and 5.95% Senior Secured Notes.

This new guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08 which clarifies principal versus agent considerations, in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10 which clarifies the identification of performance obligations and the implementation guidance for licensing, and in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12 which clarifies assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. The updated guidance also requires additional disclosures regarding the nature, timing and uncertainty of the Company's revenue transactions. The Company will adopt the accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018 with a cumulative adjustment that will increase retained earnings approximately $14 million using the modified transition method. The Company has completed their review of the applicable ASU and has concluded it will recognize revenue at the time of shipment to its customers consistent with when title passes. This is a change from the current practice whereby the Company recognizes revenue at the time of delivery to the customers and deferred revenue is recorded to account for the shipments in-transit. The Company has also concluded that it will continue to act as principal in certain vendor arrangements and will recognize credit card income for its QVC-branded credit card as part of net revenue. At the current time, the credit card income is included as an offset to selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, the Company's balance sheet presentation of its sales return reserve will change to present a separate return asset and liability, instead of the net presentation currently used. The Company will also elect the practical expedient to not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component when its payment terms are less than one year, as well as the practical expedient to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price sales and similar taxes collected from customers.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. The new principle is part of the FASB's simplification initiative and applies to entities that measure inventory using a method other than last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") or the retail inventory method. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2017, and there was no significant effect of the standard on its financial reporting.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Statements - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which requires equity investments with readily determinable fair values (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income and simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. The new standard is effective for the Company for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company plans to adopt this standard during the first quarter of 2018 and does not expect that the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which revises the accounting related to lessee accounting. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. The new lease guidance also simplifies the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019 and should be applied through a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. While the Company is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on its ongoing financial reporting, it expects that the operating leases listed in note 9 - Leases to the accompanying consolidated financial statements will be recognized as right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets upon adoption of the new standard.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which addresses eight specific cash flow issues to reduce the diversity in practice for appropriate classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt this ASU beginning January 1, 2018 and does not expect that the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nII-13\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires an entity to recognize at the transaction date the income tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers other than inventory. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this standard during the first quarter of 2018 and does not expect that the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this standard during the first quarter of 2018 and does not expect that the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the measurement for impairment by calculating the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the reporting unit. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard during the fourth quarter of 2017 and there was no significant effect of the standard on its financial reporting.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting, to provide clarity to which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. The amendments in this update are effective for all entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this standard during the first quarter of 2018 and does not expect that the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires QVC to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates include, but are not limited to, sales returns, uncollectible receivables, inventory obsolescence, depreciable lives of fixed assets, internally developed software, valuation of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, and income taxes. QVC bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that QVC believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In addition, as circumstances change, QVC may revise the basis of its estimates accordingly.\nGoodwill and long-lived assets\nQVC's long-lived asset valuations are primarily comprised of the annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangibles, such as trademarks, and the evaluation of the recoverability of other long-lived assets upon certain triggering events. If the carrying value of long-lived assets exceeds their undiscounted cash flows, QVC is required to write the carrying value down to the fair value. Any such writedown is included in depreciation/amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. A high degree of judgment is required to estimate the fair value of the long-lived assets. QVC may use quoted market prices, prices for similar assets, present value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates. QVC may need to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to implement these valuation techniques. Due to the high degree of judgment involved in estimation techniques, any value ultimately derived from the long-lived assets may differ from the estimate of fair value. As both of QVC's operating segments have long-lived assets, this critical accounting estimate affects the financial position and results of operations of each segment.\nII-14\nQVC utilizes a qualitative assessment for determining whether step one of the goodwill impairment analysis is necessary. The accounting guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether an impairment exists. In evaluating goodwill on a qualitative basis, QVC reviews the business performance of each reporting unit and evaluates other relevant factors as identified in the relevant accounting guidance to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indicated impairment exists for any of our reporting units. A reporting unit is defined in accounting guidance in accordance with U.S. GAAP as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (also known as a component). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. The Company considers whether there were any negative macroeconomic conditions, industry specific conditions, market changes, increased competition, increased costs in doing business, management challenges and the legal environments, and how these factors might impact country specific performance in future periods.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, QVC performed only qualitative assessments as it was more likely than not that the carrying values exceeded the fair values for each of the reporting units.\nThe accounting guidance also permits entities to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If the qualitative assessment supports that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, exceeds its fair value, then a quantitative assessment is performed. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nThere were no goodwill and other intangible asset impairments in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>QVC-U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>QVC-Germany\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>QVC-Japan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>QVC-U.K.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>QVC-Italy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance as of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exchange rate fluctuations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance as of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>4,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exchange rate fluctuations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance as of December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRetail related adjustments and allowances\nQVC records adjustments and allowances for sales returns, inventory obsolescence and uncollectible receivables. Each of these adjustments is estimated based on historical experience. Sales returns are calculated as a percent of sales and are netted against revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, sales returns represented 18.1%, 18.3% and 19.1% of gross product revenue, respectively. The inventory obsolescence reserve is calculated as a percent of inventory at the end of a reporting period based on, among other factors, the average inventory balance for the preceding twelve months and historical experience with liquidated inventory. The change in the reserve is included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2017, inventory was $1,019 million, which was net of the obsolescence adjustment of $92 million. At December 31, 2016, inventory was $950 million, which was net of the obsolescence adjustment of $76 million. The allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated as a percent of accounts receivable at the end of a reporting period, and it is based on historical experience, with the change in such allowance being recorded as a provision for doubtful accounts in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2017, trade accounts receivable were $1,388 million, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of $91 million. At December 31, 2016, trade accounts receivable were $1,246 million, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of $97 million. Each of these adjustments requires management judgment. Actual results could differ from management's estimates.\nII-15\nAccounting for income taxes\nQVC is required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the financial statements or tax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which QVC operates. This process requires management to make judgments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact of the various agreements and transactions into which QVC enters. Based on these judgments, QVC may record tax reserves or adjustments to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets to reflect the expected realizability of future tax benefits. Tax benefits from uncertain tax positions may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which QVC operates, QVC's inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year's liability by taxing authorities. These changes could have a significant impact on QVC's financial position.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information concerning our results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.\nOverview\nQVC, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (\"QVC\" or the \"Company\") is a retailer of a wide range of consumer products, which are marketed and sold primarily by merchandise-focused televised shopping programs, the Internet and mobile applications.\nIn the United States (\"U.S.\"), QVC's televised shopping programs, including live and recorded content, are broadcast across multiple channels nationally on a full-time basis, including QVC, QVC2 and Beauty iQ. The Company's U.S. programming is also available on QVC.com, QVC's U.S. website; mobile applications via streaming video; over-the-air broadcasters; and over-the-top content platforms (Roku, Apple TV, Facebook, etc.).\nQVC believes that the Company's digital platforms complement the Company's televised shopping programs by allowing consumers to purchase a wide assortment of goods offered on QVC's televised programs, as well as other products that are available only on the Company's digital platforms. The Company views e-commerce as a natural extension of the Company's business, allowing the Company to stream live video and offer on-demand video segments of items recently presented live on QVC's televised programs. The Company's digital platforms allow shoppers to browse, research, compare and perform targeted searches for products, control the order-entry process and conveniently access their QVC account.\nQVC's international televised shopping programs, including live and recorded content, are distributed to households outside of the U.S., primarily in Germany, Austria, Japan, the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), the Republic of Ireland, Italy and France. In some of the countries where QVC operates, QVC's televised shopping programs are broadcast across multiple QVC channels: QVC Beauty & Style and QVC2 in Germany and QVC Beauty, QVC Extra and QVC Style in the U.K. The programming created for most of these markets is also available via streaming video on QVC's digital platforms. QVC's international business employs product sourcing teams who select products tailored to the interests of each local market.\nThe Company's Japanese operations (\"QVC-Japan\") are conducted through a joint venture with Mitsui & Co., LTD (\"Mitsui\"). QVC-Japan is owned 60% by the Company and 40% by Mitsui. The Company and Mitsui share in all profits and losses based on their respective ownership interests. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, QVC-Japan paid dividends to Mitsui of $40 million, $39 million and $36 million, respectively.\nThe Company also has a joint venture with CNR Media Group, formerly known as China Broadcasting Corporation, a limited liability company owned by China National Radio (''CNR''). The Company owns a 49% interest in a CNR subsidiary, CNR Home Shopping Co., Ltd. (''CNRS''). CNRS operates a retail business in China through a shopping television channel with an associated website. This joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment recorded as equity in losses of investee in the consolidated statements of operations.\nII-1\nThe Company is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive Corporation (\"Liberty\"), which owns interests in a broad range of digital commerce businesses, and is attributed to Liberty's QVC Group. The QVC Group common stock (Nasdaq: QVCA and QVCB) tracks the assets and liabilities of the QVC Group. The QVC Group tracks the Company, zulily, llc (\"zulily\") and HSN, Inc. (\"HSN\"), cash and certain liabilities. On April 4, 2017, Liberty entered into an agreement with General Communication, Inc. (\"GCI\"), an Alaska corporation, and Liberty Interactive LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty, whereby Liberty will acquire GCI through a reorganization in which certain assets and liabilities attributed to Liberty's Ventures Group will be contributed to GCI in exchange for a controlling interest in GCI. Liberty will then effect a tax-free separation of its controlling interest in the combined company. The transactions are expected to be consummated on March 9, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Simultaneous with that closing, the QVC Group common stock will become the only outstanding common stock of Liberty, and thus QVC Group common stock will cease to function as tracking stock and will effectively become regular common stock. In addition, Liberty will be renamed Qurate Retail Group, Inc., with QVC, HSN and zulily as wholly-owned subsidiaries. On December 29, 2017, Liberty completed the acquisition of the remaining 62% ownership interest of HSN in an all-stock transaction. HSN is attributed to the QVC Group. The QVC Group does not represent a separate legal entity; rather, it represents those businesses, assets and liabilities that are attributed to that group. HSN is not included in the results of operations or financial position of QVC presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nOn October 1, 2015, Liberty acquired all of the outstanding shares of zulily and QVC declared and paid a dividend to Liberty in the amount of $910 million with funds drawn from the Company's credit facility to support Liberty's purchase. zulily is an online retailer offering customers a fun and entertaining shopping experience with a fresh selection of new product styles launched each day for a limited time period. zulily is attributed to the QVC Group and the Company believes that its business is complementary to the Company. zulily is not part of the results of operations or financial position of QVC presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2017, QVC and zulily engaged in multiple transactions relating to sales, sourcing of merchandise, marketing initiatives, business advisory services and software development. The gross value of these transactions totaled $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and less than $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which did not have a material impact on QVC's financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.\nOn June 23, 2016, QVC amended and restated its senior secured credit facility (the \"Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\") increasing the revolving credit facility from $2.25 billion to $2.65 billion as explained further in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement includes a $400 million tranche that may be borrowed by QVC or zulily. Under the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, QVC and zulily are jointly and severally liable for all amounts borrowed on the $400 million tranche. In accordance with the accounting guidance for obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements, QVC will record a liability for amounts it has borrowed under the credit facility plus any additional amount it expects to repay on behalf of zulily. As of December 31, 2017, there was $267 million borrowed by zulily on the $400 million tranche of the senior secured credit facility, none of which the Company expects to repay on behalf of zulily.\nQVC engages with CommerceHub, Inc. (\"CommerceHub\") which was an approximately 99% owned subsidiary of Liberty prior to the completion of its spin-off from Liberty in July 2016, to handle communications between QVC and certain of its vendors for drop ship sales and returns. CommerceHub is not part of the results of operations or financial position of QVC presented in our consolidated financial statements. During each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, QVC paid CommerceHub for the related services totaling less than $3 million, which did not have a material impact on QVC's financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. On July 22, 2016, Liberty completed the spin-off of CommerceHub. As a result, Liberty and CommerceHub are now separate publicly traded companies.\nStrategies and challenges of business units\nQVC's goal is to become the preeminent global multimedia shopping community for people who love to shop, and to offer a shopping experience that is as much about entertainment and enrichment as it is about buying. QVC's objective is to provide an integrated shopping experience that utilizes all forms of media including television, the Internet and mobile devices. QVC intends to employ several strategies to achieve these goals and objectives. Among these strategies are to (i) extend the breadth, relevance and exposure of the QVC brand; (ii) source products that represent unique quality and value; (iii) create engaging presentation content in televised programming, mobile and online; (iv) leverage customer loyalty and continue multi-platform expansion; and (v) create a compelling and differentiated customer experience. In addition, QVC expects to expand globally by leveraging its existing systems, infrastructure and skills in other countries around the world.\nII-2\nQVC's future net revenue growth will primarily depend on sales growth from e-commerce and mobile platforms, additions of new customers from households already receiving QVC's television programming and increased spending from existing customers. QVC's future net revenue may also be affected by (i) the willingness of cable television and direct-to-home satellite system operators to continue carrying QVC's programming service; (ii) QVC's ability to maintain favorable channel positioning, which may become more difficult due to governmental action or from distributors converting analog customers to digital; (iii) changes in television viewing habits because of personal video recorders, video-on-demand and Internet video services; and (iv) general economic conditions.\nIn March 2013, QVC-U.S. launched over-the-air broadcasting in designated U.S. markets that can be accessed by any television household with a digital antenna in such markets, regardless of whether it subscribes to a paid television service. This allows QVC-U.S. to reach new customers who previously did not have access to the program through other television platforms. In August 2013, QVC-U.S. launched an additional channel, QVC2, which is being distributed through cable and satellite systems. The channel allows viewers to have access to a broader range of QVC programming options as well as more relevant programming for viewers in differing time zones. In October 2016, QVC-U.S. launched a third channel, Beauty iQ, which is being distributed through satellite and streaming platforms. The channel and supporting platforms are dedicated to a complete beauty shopping experience for customers.\nInternationally, beyond the main QVC channels, QVC-International broadcasts pre-recorded and live shows on additional channels that offer viewers access to a broader range of QVC programming options. These channels include QVC Beauty & Style and QVC2 in Germany and QVC Beauty, QVC Extra and QVC Style in the U.K.\nEconomic uncertainty in various regions of the world in which our subsidiaries and affiliates operate could adversely affect demand for our products and services since a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from discretionary spending by individuals, which typically falls during times of economic instability. Global financial markets have recently experienced disruptions, including increased volatility and diminished liquidity and credit availability. If economic and financial market conditions in the U.S. or other key markets, including Japan and Europe, become uncertain or deteriorate , our customers may respond by suspending, delaying or reducing their discretionary spending. A suspension, delay or reduction in discretionary spending could adversely affect revenue. Accordingly, our ability to increase or maintain revenue and earnings could be adversely affected to the extent that relevant economic environments decline. Such weak economic conditions may also inhibit our expansion into new European and other markets. We currently are unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects.\nOn June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which British citizens approved an exit from the European Union (the \"E.U.\"), commonly referred to as Brexit.\u201d As a result of the referendum, the global markets and currencies have been adversely impacted, including a sharp decline in the value of the U.K. Pound Sterling as compared to the U.S. dollar. Volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the E.U. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on us will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations. Although it is unknown what the result of those negotiations will be, it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results. On March 29, 2017, the U.K. invoked Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is the first step of the U.K.'s formal exit from the E.U. This started the two-year window in which the U.K. and the European Commission can negotiate future terms for imports, exports, taxes, employment, immigration and other areas, ending in the exit of the U.K. from the E.U.\nThe current President of the U.S. has expressed apprehension towards existing trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and suggested that the U.S. would renegotiate or withdraw from these agreements. He also raised the possibility of significantly increasing tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly from China and Mexico. On January 23, 2017, the President of the U.S. signed a presidential memorandum to withdraw the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This and the other proposed actions, if implemented, could adversely affect our business because we sell imported products.\nII-3\nResults of Operations\nQVC's operating results were as follows: \nNet revenue\nNet revenue by segment was as follows: \nQVC's consolidated net revenue increased 1.0% and decreased 0.7% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The 2017 increase of $89 million in net revenue was primarily comprised of an increase of $405 million due to a 4.2% increase in units sold. This was primarily offset by a 2.3% decrease in average selling price per unit (\"ASP\") attributing $237 million, $33 million due to unfavorable foreign currency rates, a decrease of $27 million in shipping and handling revenue, a $15 million decrease in miscellaneous income and an increase of $4 million in estimated product returns.\nThe 2016 decrease of $61 million in net revenue was primarily due to a 3.9% decrease in ASP attributing $393 million and a $17 million decrease in shipping and handling revenue in constant currency. The decrease was offset by a 2.4% increase in units shipped attributing $237 million, a decrease of $105 million in estimated product returns and a $6 million increase primarily related to product sales with zulily.\nII-4\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the changes in revenue and expenses were affected by changes in the exchange rates for the Japanese Yen, the Euro and the U.K. Pound Sterling. In the event the U.S. Dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies in the future, QVC's revenue and operating cash flow will be negatively affected. Our product margins may continue to be under pressure due to the devaluation of foreign currencies and we will attempt to reduce our exposure through pricing and vendor negotiations, as Brexit negotiations progress.\nIn discussing our operating results, the term \"currency exchange rates\" refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the prior period's currency exchange rates. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. When we refer to \"constant currency operating results\", this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to understand better QVC's underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe percentage change in net revenue for QVC's segments in U.S. Dollars and in constant currency was as follows: \nIn 2017, QVC-U.S. net revenue increase was primarily due to a 3.7% increase in units shipped and a decrease in estimated product returns. This increase was offset by a 2.9% decrease in ASP, a $32 million decrease in shipping and handling revenue and a $14 million decrease in miscellaneous income. QVC-U.S. experienced shipped sales growth in all categories except jewelry. The decrease in estimated product returns was primarily due to an overall lower return rate across all product categories except jewelry. The decrease in net shipping and handling revenue was a result of a decrease in shipping and handling revenue per unit from promotional offers. QVC-International net revenue growth in constant currency was primarily due to a 5.0% increase in units shipped, driven by increases in Japan, Germany, France and the U.K. offset by a decrease in units shipped in Italy. There was a $5 million increase in shipping and handling revenue, primarily driven by Japan. This was offset by a decrease of 1.0% in ASP, primarily driven in Japan and Germany offset by increases in Italy and the U.K. and a $20 million increase in estimated product returns, driven by all markets except Japan. QVC-International experienced shipped sales growth in constant currency in all categories except electronics and jewelry.\nIn 2016, QVC-U.S. net revenue decline was primarily due to a 5.5% decrease in ASP and 4.0% decrease in shipping and handling revenue. The decline was offset by a 2.3% increase in units shipped and a decrease in estimated product returns. QVC-U.S. experienced shipped sales declines in jewelry, electronics and beauty with growth in apparel, home and accessories. The decrease in net shipping and handling revenue was primarily due to the decrease in shipping and handling rates per unit from promotional offers. The decrease in estimated product returns was primarily due to a decrease in the overall lower return rate across all product categories and sales. QVC-International net revenue growth in constant currency was primarily due to a 2.5% increase in units shipped, driven mainly in Germany and the U.K. offset by the increase in estimated product returns, driven primarily by product returns in Germany. QVC-International experienced shipped sales growth in constant currency in all categories except jewelry and apparel.\nCost of goods sold (excluding depreciation and amortization)\nQVC's cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue remained consistent at 63.8% for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and was 63.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The slight increase in the cost of goods sold percentage in 2016 was primarily due to decreased product margins and increased freight costs in the U.S. associated with the increases in units shipped partially offset by a favorable inventory obsolescence provision in the U.S.\nOperating expenses\nQVC's operating expenses are principally comprised of commissions, order processing and customer service expenses, credit card processing fees and telecommunications expenses. Operating expenses decreased $5 million or 0.8% and decreased $1 million or 0.2% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nII-5\nThe decrease in 2017 was primarily due to favorable exchange rates. The slight decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower telecommunication expense offset by increased commissions expense. The decrease in telecommunication expense was primarily due to lower phone and network rates in the U.S. The increase in commissions expense was primarily due to increases internationally offset by a decrease in sales in the U.S.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (excluding stock-based compensation) (\"SG&A expenses\")\nQVC's SG&A expenses include personnel, information technology, provision for doubtful accounts, credit card income, production costs and marketing and advertising expenses. Such expenses decreased $21 million, and decreased to 7.7% of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year and decreased $18 million, and decreased to 8.0% of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year as a result of a variety of factors.\nThe decrease in 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense of $35 million, a decrease in severance expense of $13 million, $4 million from favorable foreign currency rates and a $6 million increase in credit card income offset by an increase in bonus expense of $33 million and a $4 million increase in marketing expenses. The decrease in bad debt expense was primarily related to lower default rates associated with the Easy-Pay program in the U.S. The increase in credit card income was due to the favorable economics of the QVC-branded credit card (\"Q card\") portfolio in the U.S. The increase in marketing expenses was primarily due to an increase in the investment made to eMarketing partially offset by discontinuing the naming rights to the Chiba Marine Stadium in Japan.\nThe decrease in 2016 was primarily related to reduced personnel costs of $63 million and an increase of credit card income of $8 million which was offset by increases in bad debt expense of $25 million, software expense of $13 million, franchise tax expense of $10 million and external services of $8 million. The decrease in personnel costs was primarily due to a decrease in bonuses and benefits in the U.S. and severance. The increase in credit card income was due to the favorable economics and usage of the Q card portfolio in the U.S. The increase in bad debt expense was primarily related to an increase in U.S. Easy-Pay sales penetration and default rates. The increase in software expense was mainly due to an increase in software licensing and software maintenance. The increase in franchise tax expense was mainly due to a favorable franchise tax reserve adjustment related to an audit settlement in 2015 which was not experienced in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in external services was primarily due to internal control enhancements and the establishment of a global business service center located in Krakow, Poland.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation includes compensation related to options and restricted stock granted to certain officers and employees. QVC recorded $31 million, $32 million and $31 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nII-6\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization consisted of the following: \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, acquisition related amortization expense decreased primarily due to the end of the useful lives of certain affiliate agreements and customer relationships established at the time of Liberty's acquisition of QVC in 2003. This was offset by an increase in channel placement amortization related to the addition of Beauty iQ in the U.S. The increase in depreciation related to the additions at the California distribution center. For the year ended December 31, 2016, depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to expense related to the additions at the California distribution center and new website functionality.\nEquity in losses of investee\nThe losses were associated with our joint venture in China that is accounted for as an equity method investment.\nGains on financial instruments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, QVC entered into a three-year interest rate swap arrangement with a notional amount of $125 million to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with interest payments related to its variable rate debt. The swap arrangement does not qualify as a cash flow hedge under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\" or \"U.S. GAAP\"). Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap are reflected in gain on financial instruments in our consolidated statement of operations. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of the swap instrument was in a net asset position of approximately $2 million which was included in other noncurrent assets. A 1% change in the one-month U.S. LIBOR rate (floating portion of the interest rate swap) will result in a change in the value of the swap instrument of less than $2 million.\nInterest expense, net\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, consolidated net interest expense, increased $4 million and $2 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The increase in net interest expense in 2017 is due to higher average interest rates compared to the previous year, partially offset by lower average debt balances outstanding under the credit agreement. The slight increase in net interest expense in 2016 is due to higher average debt balances partially offset by the lower interest rates.\nForeign currency gain\nCertain loans between QVC and its subsidiaries are deemed to be short-term in nature, and accordingly, the translation of these loans is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. The change in foreign currency gain was also due to variances in interest and operating payables balances between QVC and its international subsidiaries denominated in the currency of the subsidiary and the effects of currency exchange rate changes on those balances.\nII-7\nIncome taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 13.5%, 37.5% and 37.0% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The rates have historically differed from the U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to state tax expense. The effective tax rate decreased in 2017 mainly due to the impact of the federal tax rate reduction under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( the Act\u201d) which was enacted in December 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects the future reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Act, and resulted in the Company reporting an income tax benefit of $285 million (25% reduction of the effective rate). This benefit resulted from the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities related to non-current intangible assets that will reverse at the new 21% rate. An entity is required to reflect the effects of changes in tax laws or rates in income from continuing operations in the interim period that includes the enactment date.\nThe effective tax rate increased during 2016 over 2015 due to a change in Federal tax law relating to foreign exchange gains and losses in connection to foreign branches, which was partially offset by a change in the accounting treatment of share based payments.\nAdjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted OIBDA\")\nQVC defines Adjusted OIBDA as net revenue less cost of goods sold, operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding stock-based compensation). QVC's chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate the businesses and make decisions about allocating resources among the businesses. QVC believes that this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of the businesses, including the ability to service debt and fund capital expenditures. In addition, this measure allows QVC to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and perform benchmarking among its businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. This measure of performance excludes such costs as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation that are included in the measurement of operating income pursuant to U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe primary material limitations associated with the use of Adjusted OIBDA as compared to GAAP results are (i) it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in the industry, and (ii) it excludes financial information that some may consider important in evaluating QVC's performance. QVC compensates for these limitations by providing disclosure of the difference between Adjusted OIBDA and GAAP results, including providing a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to GAAP results, to enable investors to perform their own analysis of QVC's operating results. Refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to income before income taxes.\nSeasonality\nQVC's business is seasonal due to a higher volume of sales in the fourth calendar quarter related to year-end holiday shopping. In recent years, QVC has earned, on average, between 22% and 24% of its revenue in each of the first three quarters of the year and between 30% and 32% of its revenue in the fourth quarter of the year.\nFinancial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nHistorically, QVC's primary sources of cash have been cash provided by operating activities and borrowings. In general, QVC uses this cash to fund its operations, make capital purchases, make payments to Liberty, make interest payments and minimize QVC's outstanding senior secured credit facility balance.\nAs of December 31, 2017, substantially all of QVC's cash and cash equivalents were invested in AAA rated money market funds and time deposits with banks rated equal to or above A.\nII-8\nSenior Secured Notes\nAll of QVC's senior secured notes are secured by the capital stock of QVC and certain of its subsidiaries and have equal priority to the senior secured credit facility. The interest on all of QVC's senior secured notes is payable semi-annually.\n3.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2019\nOn March 18, 2014, QVC issued $400 million principal amount of 3.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2019 at an issue price of 99.828%. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used to repay indebtedness under QVC's senior secured credit facility and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n5.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2022\nOn July 2, 2012, QVC issued $500 million principal amount of 5.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 at par. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used to repay indebtedness under QVC's senior secured credit facility and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n4.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2023\nOn March 18, 2013, QVC issued $750 million principal amount of 4.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 at an issue price of 99.968%. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used to reduce the outstanding principal of previously outstanding notes and the senior secured credit facility, as well as for general corporate purposes.\n4.85% Senior Secured Notes due 2024\nOn March 18, 2014, QVC issued $600 million principal amount of 4.85% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 at an issue price of 99.927%. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used to repay indebtedness under QVC's senior secured credit facility and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n4.45% Senior Secured Notes due 2025\nOn August 21, 2014, QVC issued $600 million principal amount of 4.45% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 at an issue price of 99.860%. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used for the redemption of previously outstanding notes, for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n5.45% Senior Secured Notes due 2034\nOn August 21, 2014, QVC issued $400 million principal amount of 5.45% Senior Secured Notes due 2034 at an issue price of 99.784%. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used for the redemption of previously outstanding notes, for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n5.95% Senior Secured Notes due 2043\nOn March 18, 2013, QVC issued $300 million principal amount of 5.95% Senior Secured Notes due 2043 at an issue price of 99.973%. The net proceeds from the offerings of these notes were used to reduce the principal of previously outstanding notes and the senior secured credit facility, as well as for general corporate purposes.\nII-9\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nOn June 23, 2016, QVC entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with zulily as borrowers (collectively, the Borrowers\u201d) which is a multi-currency facility that provides for a $2.65 billion revolving credit facility with a $300 million sub-limit for standby letters of credit and $1.5 billion of uncommitted incremental revolving loan commitments or incremental term loans. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement includes a $400 million tranche that may be borrowed by the Company or zulily with an additional $50 million sub-limit for standby letters of credit. The remaining $2.25 billion and any incremental loans may be borrowed only by the Company. Borrowings that are alternate base rate loans will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the base rate plus a margin that varies between 0.25% and 0.75% depending on the Borrowers' combined ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (the Combined Consolidated Leverage Ratio\u201d). Borrowings that are LIBOR loans will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the applicable LIBOR rate plus a margin that varies between 1.25% and 1.75% depending on the Borrowers' Combined Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Because the calculation of the consolidated leverage ratio was revised to include zulily, the effective interest rate margins, on the date that the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement was entered into, decreased from the interest rate margins under the previous bank credit facility. Each loan may be prepaid at any time and from time to time without penalty other than customary breakage costs. No mandatory prepayments will be required other than when borrowings and letter of credit usage exceed availability; provided that, if zulily ceases to be controlled by Liberty, all of its loans must be repaid and its letters of credit cash collateralized. The facility matures on June 23, 2021, except that $140 million of the $2.25 billion commitment available to QVC matures on March 9, 2020. Any amounts prepaid on the revolving facility may be reborrowed. Payment of loans may be accelerated following certain customary events of default.\nQVC had $877 million available under the terms of the senior secured credit facility at December 31, 2017, including the portion available under the $400 million tranche that zulily may also borrow on. The interest rate on the senior secured credit facility was 3.0% at December 31, 2017.\nThe purpose of the amendment was to, among other things, extend the maturity of our senior secured credit facility, provide zulily the opportunity to borrow on the senior secured credit facility(see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements) and lower the interest rate on borrowings. The payment and performance of the Borrowers' obligations under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are guaranteed by each of QVC's Material Domestic Subsidiaries (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). Further, the borrowings under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are secured, pari passu with QVC's existing notes, by a pledge of all of QVC's equity interests. In addition, the payment and performance of the Borrowers' obligations with respect to the $400 million tranche available to both QVC and zulily are also guaranteed by zulily and secured by a pledge of all of zulily's equity interests.\nThe Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including certain restrictions on the Company and zulily and each of their respective restricted subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions) with respect to, among other things: incurring additional indebtedness; creating liens on property or assets; making certain loans or investments; selling or disposing of assets; paying certain dividends and other restricted payments; dissolving, consolidating or merging; entering into certain transactions with affiliates; entering into sale or leaseback transactions; restricting subsidiary distributions; and limiting the Company's consolidated leverage ratio and the Borrowers' Combined Consolidated Leverage Ratio.\nOther Debt Related Information\nOn April 15, 2015, QVC completed the redemption of previously outstanding senior secured notes which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of $21 million. No such transaction occurred in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nQVC was in compliance with all of its debt covenants at December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, there were no significant changes to QVC's debt credit ratings.\nThe weighted average interest rate applicable to all of the outstanding debt (excluding capital and build to suit leases) prior to amortization of bond discounts and related debt issuance costs was 4.2% as of December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, outstanding trade letters of credit totaled $16 million and $18 million, respectively.\nII-10\nThere are no restrictions under the debt agreements on QVC's ability to pay dividends or make other restricted payments if QVC is not in default on its senior secured notes or senior secured credit facility, and QVC's consolidated leverage ratio, and a combined consolidated leverage ratio for both QVC and zulily, would be no greater than 3.5 to 1.0. As a result, Liberty will, in many instances, be permitted to rely on QVC's cash flow for servicing Liberty's debt and for other purposes, including repurchases of Liberty's common stock, or to fund acquisitions or other operational requirements of Liberty and its subsidiaries. These events may increase accumulated deficit or require QVC to borrow under the senior secured credit facility, increasing QVC's leverage and decreasing liquidity. QVC has made significant distributions to Liberty in the past. See Item 1. Business - Liberty Relationship and Related Party Transactions.\u201d\nAdditional Cash Flow Information\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, QVC's primary uses of cash were $2,278 million of principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations, $866 million of dividends to Liberty, $202 million of capital and television distribution rights expenditures, $40 million in dividend payments from QVC-Japan to Mitsui and $16 million of other financing activities. These uses of cash were funded primarily with $2,162 million of principal borrowings from the senior secured credit facility and $1,202 million of cash provided by operating activities. As of December 31, 2017, QVC's cash and cash equivalents balance (excluding restricted cash) was $260 million.\nThe change in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the previous year was primarily due to an increase in net income partially offset by a decrease in deferred taxes. The decrease in deferred tax liability is mainly due a reduction of the corporate tax rate as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Cash provided by operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nAs of December 31, 2017, $204 million of the $260 million in cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries. Cash in foreign subsidiaries is available for domestic purposes with no significant tax consequences upon repatriation to the U.S. QVC accrues taxes on the unremitted earnings of its international subsidiaries. Approximately 79% of this foreign cash balance was that of QVC-Japan. QVC owns 60% of QVC-Japan and shares all profits and losses with the 40% minority interest holder, Mitsui. We believe that we currently have appropriate legal structures in place to repatriate foreign cash as tax efficiently as possible and meet the business needs of QVC.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, QVC's primary uses of cash were $1,733 million of principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations, $703 million of dividends to Liberty, $217 million of capital and television distribution rights expenditures, $39 million in dividend payments from QVC-Japan to Mitsui and $9 million of other financing activities. These uses of cash were funded primarily with $1,505 million of principal borrowings from the senior secured credit facility and $1,178 million of cash provided by operating activities. As of December 31, 2016, QVC's cash and cash equivalents balance (excluding restricted cash) was $284 million.\nThe change in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the previous year was primarily due to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, QVC's primary uses of cash were $2,177 million of principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations, $1,485 million of dividends to Liberty, $287 million of capital and cable and satellite television distribution rights expenditures, $36 million in dividend payments from QVC-Japan to Mitsui, $18 million of bond premium fees and $15 million of other financing activities. These uses of cash were funded primarily with $2,974 million of principal borrowings from the senior secured credit facility and $1,028 million of cash provided by operating activities. As of December 31, 2015, QVC's cash and cash equivalents balance (excluding restricted cash) was $327 million.\nOther\nCapital expenditures spending in 2018 is expected to be between $180 and $230 million.\nOn July 2, 2015, QVC entered into a lease (the Lease\u201d) for a new California distribution center. Pursuant to the Lease, the landlord built an approximately one million square foot rental building in Ontario, California (the Premises\u201d), and thereafter leased the Premises to QVC as its new California distribution center for an initial term of 15 years. Under the Lease, QVC is required to pay an initial base rent of approximately $6 million per year, increasing to approximately $8 million per year by the final year of the initial term, as well as all real estate taxes and other building operating costs. QVC also has an option to extend the term of the Lease for up to two consecutive terms of 10 years each.\nII-11\nQVC has the right to purchase the Premises and related land from the landlord by entering into an amended and restated agreement at any time during the twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth months of the Lease's initial term, which will occur in June and July of 2018, with a $10 million initial payment and annual payments of $12 million over a term of 13 years.\nThe Company concluded that it was the deemed owner (for accounting purposes only) of the Premises during the construction period under build to suit lease accounting. Building construction began in July of 2015. During the construction period, the Company recorded estimated project construction costs incurred by the landlord as a projects in progress asset and a corresponding long-term liability in \"Property and equipment, net\" and \"Other long-term liabilities,\" respectively, on its consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the Company paid for normal tenant improvements and certain structural improvements and recorded these amounts as part of the projects in progress asset. Upon completion of construction, the long-term liability was reclassified to debt. The Company incurred construction costs of $89 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. No such cost were incurred for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOn August 29, 2016, the California distribution center officially opened. The Company evaluated whether the Lease met the criteria for \"sale-leaseback\" treatment under U.S. GAAP and concluded that it did not. Therefore, the Company treats the Lease as a financing obligation and lease payments will be attributed to: (1) a reduction of the principal financing obligation; (2) imputed interest expense; and (3) land lease expense representing an imputed cost to lease the underlying land of the Premises. In addition, the building asset will be depreciated over its estimated useful life of 20 years. Although the Company did not begin making monthly lease payments pursuant to the Lease until February 2017, the portion of the lease obligations allocated to the land has been treated for accounting purposes as an operating lease that commenced in 2015. If the Company does not exercise its right to purchase the Premises and related land, the Company will derecognize both the net book values of the asset and the financing obligation at the conclusion of the lease term.\nRefer to the chart under the \"Off-balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\" section below for additional information concerning the amount and timing of expected future payments under QVC's contractual obligations at December 31, 2017.\nQVC has contingent liabilities related to legal and tax proceedings and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Although it is reasonably possible QVC may incur losses upon the conclusion of such matters, an estimate of any loss or range of loss cannot be made. In the opinion of management, it is expected that amounts, if any, that may be required to satisfy such contingencies will not be material in relation to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nInformation concerning the amount and timing of required payments, both accrued and off-balance sheet, under our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 is summarized below: \n(1) Amounts exclude capital lease obligations and the issue discounts on the 3.125%, 4.375%, 4.85%, 4.45%, 5.45% and 5.95% Senior Secured Notes. Additionally, the presentation assumes there is no amount outstanding on the $140 million commitment under our senior secured credit facility that matures on March 9, 2020.\n(2) Amounts (i) are based on the terms of QVC's senior secured credit facility and senior secured notes, (ii) assume the interest rates on the floating rate debt remain constant at the rates in effect as of December 31, 2017, (iii) assume that our existing debt is repaid at maturity and (iv) exclude capital and build to suit lease obligations.\n(3) Amounts include open purchase orders for inventory and non-inventory purchases along with other contractual obligations.\nII-12\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. This new guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08 which clarifies principal versus agent considerations, in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10 which clarifies the identification of performance obligations and the implementation guidance for licensing, and in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12 which clarifies assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. The updated guidance also requires additional disclosures regarding the nature, timing and uncertainty of the Company's revenue transactions. The Company will adopt the accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018 with a cumulative adjustment that will increase retained earnings approximately $14 million using the modified transition method. The Company has completed their review of the applicable ASU and has concluded it will recognize revenue at the time of shipment to its customers consistent with when title passes. This is a change from the current practice whereby the Company recognizes revenue at the time of delivery to the customers and deferred revenue is recorded to account for the shipments in-transit. The Company has also concluded that it will continue to act as principal in certain vendor arrangements and will recognize credit card income for its QVC-branded credit card as part of net revenue. At the current time, the credit card income is included as an offset to selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, the Company's balance sheet presentation of its sales return reserve will change to present a separate return asset and liability, instead of the net presentation currently used. The Company will also elect the practical expedient to not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component when its payment terms are less than one year, as well as the practical expedient to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price sales and similar taxes collected from customers.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. The new principle is part of the FASB's simplification initiative and applies to entities that measure inventory using a method other than last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") or the retail inventory method. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2017, and there was no significant effect of the standard on its financial reporting.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Statements - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which requires equity investments with readily determinable fair values (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income and simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. The new standard is effective for the Company for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company plans to adopt this standard during the first quarter of 2018 and does not expect that the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which revises the accounting related to lessee accounting. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. The new lease guidance also simplifies the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019 and should be applied through a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. While the Company is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on its ongoing financial reporting, it expects that the operating leases listed in note 9 - Leases to the accompanying consolidated financial statements will be recognized as right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets upon adoption of the new standard.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which addresses eight specific cash flow issues to reduce the diversity in practice for appropriate classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt this ASU beginning January 1, 2018 and does not expect that the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nII-13\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires an entity to recognize at the transaction date the income tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers other than inventory. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this standard during the first quarter of 2018 and does not expect that the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this standard during the first quarter of 2018 and does not expect that the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the measurement for impairment by calculating the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the reporting unit. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard during the fourth quarter of 2017 and there was no significant effect of the standard on its financial reporting.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting, to provide clarity to which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. The amendments in this update are effective for all entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this standard during the first quarter of 2018 and does not expect that the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires QVC to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates include, but are not limited to, sales returns, uncollectible receivables, inventory obsolescence, depreciable lives of fixed assets, internally developed software, valuation of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, and income taxes. QVC bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that QVC believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In addition, as circumstances change, QVC may revise the basis of its estimates accordingly.\nGoodwill and long-lived assets\nQVC's long-lived asset valuations are primarily comprised of the annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangibles, such as trademarks, and the evaluation of the recoverability of other long-lived assets upon certain triggering events. If the carrying value of long-lived assets exceeds their undiscounted cash flows, QVC is required to write the carrying value down to the fair value. Any such writedown is included in depreciation/amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. A high degree of judgment is required to estimate the fair value of the long-lived assets. QVC may use quoted market prices, prices for similar assets, present value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates. QVC may need to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to implement these valuation techniques. Due to the high degree of judgment involved in estimation techniques, any value ultimately derived from the long-lived assets may differ from the estimate of fair value. As both of QVC's operating segments have long-lived assets, this critical accounting estimate affects the financial position and results of operations of each segment.\nII-14\nQVC utilizes a qualitative assessment for determining whether step one of the goodwill impairment analysis is necessary. The accounting guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether an impairment exists. In evaluating goodwill on a qualitative basis, QVC reviews the business performance of each reporting unit and evaluates other relevant factors as identified in the relevant accounting guidance to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indicated impairment exists for any of our reporting units. A reporting unit is defined in accounting guidance in accordance with U.S. GAAP as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (also known as a component). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. The Company considers whether there were any negative macroeconomic conditions, industry specific conditions, market changes, increased competition, increased costs in doing business, management challenges and the legal environments, and how these factors might impact country specific performance in future periods.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, QVC performed only qualitative assessments as it was more likely than not that the carrying values exceeded the fair values for each of the reporting units.\nThe accounting guidance also permits entities to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If the qualitative assessment supports that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, exceeds its fair value, then a quantitative assessment is performed. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nThere were no goodwill and other intangible asset impairments in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\n\nRetail related adjustments and allowances\nQVC records adjustments and allowances for sales returns, inventory obsolescence and uncollectible receivables. Each of these adjustments is estimated based on historical experience. Sales returns are calculated as a percent of sales and are netted against revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, sales returns represented 18.1%, 18.3% and 19.1% of gross product revenue, respectively. The inventory obsolescence reserve is calculated as a percent of inventory at the end of a reporting period based on, among other factors, the average inventory balance for the preceding twelve months and historical experience with liquidated inventory. The change in the reserve is included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2017, inventory was $1,019 million, which was net of the obsolescence adjustment of $92 million. At December 31, 2016, inventory was $950 million, which was net of the obsolescence adjustment of $76 million. The allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated as a percent of accounts receivable at the end of a reporting period, and it is based on historical experience, with the change in such allowance being recorded as a provision for doubtful accounts in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2017, trade accounts receivable were $1,388 million, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of $91 million. At December 31, 2016, trade accounts receivable were $1,246 million, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of $97 million. Each of these adjustments requires management judgment. Actual results could differ from management's estimates.\nII-15\nAccounting for income taxes\nQVC is required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the financial statements or tax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which QVC operates. This process requires management to make judgments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact of the various agreements and transactions into which QVC enters. Based on these judgments, QVC may record tax reserves or adjustments to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets to reflect the expected realizability of future tax benefits. Tax benefits from uncertain tax positions may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which QVC operates, QVC's inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year's liability by taxing authorities. These changes could have a significant impact on QVC's financial position.", "item_7_tables": "Table 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
