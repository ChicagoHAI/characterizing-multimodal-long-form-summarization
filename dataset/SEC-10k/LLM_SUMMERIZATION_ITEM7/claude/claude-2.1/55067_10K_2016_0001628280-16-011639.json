MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nKellogg Company and Subsidiaries\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBusiness overview\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand Kellogg Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report.\nFor more than 100 years, consumers have counted on Kellogg for great-tasting, high-quality and nutritious foods. Kellogg is the world's leading producer of cereal, second largest producer of cookies and crackers, and a leading producer of savory snacks and frozen foods. Additional product offerings include toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit-flavored snacks and veggie foods. Kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally.\nSegments and growth targets\nDuring Q1 2015, we established a new Kashi operating segment in order to optimize future growth potential of this business. This operating segment is included in the North America Other reportable segment. Including this new operating segment, we manage our operations through nine operating segments that are based on product category or geographic location. These operating segments are evaluated for similarity with regards to economic characteristics, products, production processes, types or classes of customers, distribution methods and regulatory environments to determine if they can be aggregated into reportable segments. We report results of operations in the following reportable segments: U.S. Morning Foods; U.S. Snacks; U.S. Specialty; North America Other; Europe; Latin America; and Asia Pacific. The reportable segments are discussed in greater detail in Note 17 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe manage our Company for sustainable performance defined by our long-term annual growth targets. Our targeted long-term annual growth is low-single-digit (1 to 3%) for currency-neutral comparable net sales, mid-single-digit (4 to 6%) for currency-neutral comparable operating profit, and high-single-digit (7 to 9%) for currency-neutral comparable diluted net earnings per share (EPS).\nSignificant items impacting comparability\nProject K and cost reduction activities\nDuring 2013, we announced Project K, a four-year efficiency and effectiveness program. The program is expected to generate a significant amount of savings that may be invested in key strategic areas of focus for the business. We expect that this investment will drive future growth in revenues, gross margin, operating profit, and cash flow. We recorded pre-tax charges related primarily to Project K of $311 million in 2015, $298 million in 2014, and $250 million in 2013.\nIn 2015 we initiated the implementation of a zero-based budgeting (ZBB) program in our North America business. In support of the ZBB initiative, we incurred pre-tax charges of approximately $12 million in 2015.\nSee the Restructuring and cost reduction activities section for more information.\nAcquisitions and dispositions\nIn September 2015, we completed the acquisition of Mass Foods, Egypt's leading cereal company for $46 million, or $44 million net of cash and cash equivalents acquired. The acquisition added $4 million in incremental net sales to our reported results in the European reportable segment for 2015. The acquisition added less than $1 million of incremental operating profit (before transaction and integration costs) to our reported results for 2015.\nIn January 2015, we completed the acquisition of a majority interest in Bisco Misr, the number one packaged biscuits company in Egypt for $125 million, or $117 million net of cash and cash equivalents acquired. The acquisition added $54 million in incremental net sales to our reported results in the European reportable segment for 2015. The acquisition added $4 million of incremental operating profit (before transaction and integration costs) to our reported results for 2015.\nDuring the quarter ended September 27, 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell our vegan and vegetarian canned-meat substitute business unit under the Loma Linda brand to Atlantic Natural Foods (ANF), LLC of Nashville, N.C. The disposition negatively impacted reported net sales in the U.S. Specialty reportable segment by approximately $9 million in 2015.\nIntegration and transaction costs\nWe have incurred integration and transaction costs related to the 2015 acquisitions of Bisco Misr and Mass Foods, the 2015 entry into a joint venture with Tolaram Africa, and the 2012 acquisition of Pringles as we move these businesses into the Kellogg business model. We recorded pre-tax integration and transaction costs of $30 million in 2015. We also recorded pre-tax integration costs of $43 million and $65 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nMark-to-market accounting for pension plans, commodities and certain foreign currency contracts\nWe recognize mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans, commodity contracts, and certain foreign currency contracts as incurred. Actuarial gains/losses for pension plans are recognized in the year they occur. Changes between contract and market prices for commodities contracts and certain foreign currency contracts result in gains/losses that are recognized in the quarter they occur. We recorded pre-tax mark-to-market charges of $446 million, $784 million, and a benefit of $947 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.\nOther costs impacting comparability\nIn 2015, a series of previously executed agreements between Kellogg's and a third party variable interest entity (VIE) were terminated resulting in our determination that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, we deconsolidated the financial statements of the VIE. As a result of the agreement terminations and related settlements, we recognized a loss of $19 million in Other income (expense), net.\nIn connection with the deconsolidation, we derecognized all assets and liabilities of the VIE, including an allocation of a portion of goodwill from the U.S. Snacks operating segment, resulting in a $67 million non-cash gain, which was recorded within operating profit.\nDuring 2014 we incurred $6 million of costs related to the evaluation of potential acquisitions.\nVenezuela remeasurement and long-lived asset impairment\nWhile we continue to qualify for participation in CENCOEX at the official rate, there has been a continued reduction in the level of U.S. dollars available to exchange, in part due to recent declines in the price of oil and the overall decline of the macroeconomic environment within the country. We have experienced an increase in the amount of time it takes to exchange bolivars for U.S. dollars through the CENCOEX exchange during the year. Given this economic backdrop, and upon review of U.S. dollar cash needs in our Venezuela operations as of the quarter ended July 4, 2015, we concluded that we were no longer able to obtain sufficient U.S. dollars on a timely basis through the CENCOEX exchange to support our Venezuela operations resulting in a decision to remeasure our Venezuela subsidiary's financial statements using the SIMADI rate. We have evaluated all of the facts and circumstances surrounding our Venezuelan business and determined that as of January 2, 2016 the SIMADI rate continues to be the appropriate rate to use for remeasuring our Venezuelan subsidiary's financial statements.\nIn connection with the change from the CENCOEX rate to the SIMADI rate that occurred in the quarter ended July 4, 2015, we evaluated the carrying value of our non-monetary assets for impairment and lower of cost or market adjustments. As a result of moving from the CENCOEX official rate to the SIMADI rate, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $152 million, including $112 million in the Latin America operating segment and $40 million in the Corporate operating segment. Of the total charges, $100 million was recorded in COGS, $3 million was recorded in SGA, and $49 million was recorded in Other income (expense), net. These charges consist of $47 million related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan bolivar at the SIMADI exchange rate (recorded in Other income (expense), net), $56 million related to reducing inventory to the lower of cost or market (recorded in COGS) and $49 million related to the impairment of long-lived assets in Venezuela (recorded primarily in COGS).\nAs expected, after moving to the SIMADI rate, our Venezuelan subsidiary utilized assets that continued to be remeasured at historical exchange rates. This resulted in an additional unfavorable impact of $17 million in the Latin America operating segment, including an impact to COGS of $12 million and SGA of $5 million. The total 2015 impact of moving from the CENCOEX official rate to the SIMADI rate was $169 million on a pre-tax basis, or approximately $.42 on a fully-diluted EPS basis.\nAs of January 2, 2016, certain non-monetary assets related to our Venezuelan subsidiary continue to be remeasured at historical exchange rates. As these assets are utilized by our Venezuelan subsidiary during the first half of 2016 they will be recognized in the income statement at historical exchange rates resulting in an unfavorable impact of approximately $4 million.\nShipping day differences\nThe Company's fiscal year normally ends on the Saturday closest to December 31 and as a result, a 53rd week is added approximately every sixth year. The Company's 2014 fiscal year ended on January 3, 2015, and included a 53rd week. While quarters normally consist of 13-week periods, the fourth quarter of 2014 included a 14th week. For comparability, the impact of the 53rd week is excluded from our comparable results. The impact of the fourth quarter 2014 53rd week was $197 million for net sales, $36 million for operating profit and $.07 on a fully-diluted EPS basis.\nForeign currency translation and the impact of Venezuela\nWe evaluate the operating results of our business on a currency-neutral basis. We determine currency-neutral operating results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.\nAs a result of our decision to change the exchange rate that we use to remeasure our Venezuela subsidiary from CENCOEX to the SIMADI exchange rate beginning mid-2015, the methodology we use to calculate the impact of foreign currency translation, as described above, results in certain year-over-year growth rates that require additional commentary. We believe that the use of our standard currency-neutral methodology in combination with the additional commentary provides important information to more fully understand our currency-neutral operating results.\nOur 2015 guidance that was maintained consistently throughout the year reflected an expectation of being approximately flat for currency-neutral comparable net sales and a decline of 2% to 4% for currency-neutral comparable operating profit. Within this guidance, Venezuela was expected to contribute approximately 1% of growth for both currency-neutral comparable net sales and currency-neutral comparable operating profit. In the second half of 2015, the Venezuela business experienced significant unplanned inflation that impacted both currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit that was much larger than anticipated in the guidance. To provide increased visibility into how we have delivered against our 2015 guidance, the commentary below provides both currency-neutral comparable results, which include the entire impact of Venezuela, as well as an adjusted measure that excludes the impact of Venezuela.\nFor the quarter ended January 2, 2016, Latin America currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth were 45.3% and 46.2% respectively. Excluding Venezuela, Latin America currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth would have been approximately 1.4% and 2.0%, respectively.\nFor the year-to-date period ended January 2, 2016, Latin America currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth were 24.6% and 15.4% respectively. Excluding Venezuela, Latin America currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth would have been approximately 1.3% and a decline of 3.4%, respectively.\nFor the quarter ended January 2, 2016, Kellogg Consolidated currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth was 4.2% and 2.8%, respectively. Excluding Venezuela, Kellogg Consolidated currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth would have been approximately 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.\nFor the year-to-date period ended January 2, 2016, Kellogg Consolidated currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth was 1.2% and a decline of 2.3%, respectively. Excluding Venezuela, Kellogg Consolidated currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit would have declined by 0.8% and 3.6%, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nComparability of certain financial measures is affected significantly by several types of financial impacts such as foreign currency translation, integration and transaction costs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans,\ncommodities and certain foreign currency contracts, Project K costs, costs associated with the Venezuela remeasurement and long-lived asset impairment, costs associated with the VIE deconsolidation, differences in shipping days, acquisitions, dispositions, and other costs impacting comparability. To provide increased transparency and assist in understanding our comparable operating performance, we use non-GAAP financial measures within MD&A that exclude these financial impacts.\nNon-GAAP financial measures used include comparable net sales, currency-neutral comparable net sales, comparable net sales growth, currency-neutral comparable net sales growth, comparable gross margin, currency-neutral comparable gross margin, comparable gross profit, currency-neutral comparable gross profit, comparable SGA%, currency-neutral comparable SGA%, comparable operating margin, currency-neutral comparable operating margin, comparable operating profit, currency-neutral comparable operating profit, comparable operating profit growth, currency-neutral comparable operating profit growth, comparable income taxes, currency-neutral comparable income taxes, comparable effective tax rate, currency-neutral comparable effective tax rate, comparable net income attributable to Kellogg Company, currency-neutral comparable net income attributable to Kellogg Company, comparable diluted EPS, currency-neutral comparable diluted EPS, comparable diluted EPS growth, and currency-neutral comparable diluted EPS growth.\nFinancial results\nFor the full year 2015, our reported net sales decreased by 7.2% due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation and shipping day differences from the 53rd week that was recognized in the prior year. Currency-neutral comparable net sales increased by 1.2%, which was better than our expectations, and includes the benefit of pricing taken in Venezuela to offset cost inflation. We experienced currency-neutral comparable net sales growth in Latin America, which was driven primarily by pricing taken in Venezuela. We also experienced currency-neutral comparable net sales growth in Asia-Pacific, U. S. Specialty and the Canadian business which is included in the North America Other reportable segment.\nReported operating profit increased by 6.6% primarily due to the favorable year-over-year change in the pension mark-to-market which was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation, the impact of remeasuring our Venezuela business using the SIMADI rate in the second quarter of 2015, and the impact of resetting incentive compensation levels. Currency-neutral comparable operating profit declined by 2.3%, at the high end of our expectations, due to the resetting of incentive compensation levels which impacted results by approximately 3%. The 1% growth excluding the effect of resetting incentive compensation levels was the result of sales growth and a 50 basis point reduction in brand-building investment as a percentage of net sales. Our brand building is down including shifts of investment into other areas such as food, the evolving shift in media investment from TV to digital, and efficiency and effectiveness benefits. Our zero-based budgeting initiative may identify additional efficiency and effectiveness opportunities in brand building as we proceed through 2016. We may choose to reinvest these savings back into brand building or other areas such as food reformulation or capacity to drive revenue growth. We remain committed to invest in our brands at an industry-leading level to maintain the strength of our many recognizable brands in the marketplace.\nReported diluted EPS of $1.72 was down 1.7% compared to the prior year of $1.75. Reported diluted EPS was impacted negatively by Project K costs ($.64), mark-to-market accounting ($.84), the remeasurement of the Venezuelan business using the SIMADI rate ($.42), foreign currency translation ($.28), and integration costs ($.06), and was impacted positively by a VIE deconsolidation ($.14) and acquisitions ($.01). Currency-neutral comparable diluted EPS of $3.81 was flat compared to prior year of $3.81, in line with our expectations.\nReconciliation of certain non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTable 41:

Foods\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 1.6% as a result of unfavorable volume and pricing/mix. This segment consists of cereal, toaster pastries, health and wellness bars, and beverages.\nWe saw a lot of improvement across the year in the Morning Foods business. We invested where we needed\nto and worked hard to improve the fundamentals by improving our brand building and the new products we\nlaunched. We also invested in our foods and put fun back in the box with Avengers\u00ae and Disney Frozen\u00ae-themed cereals.\nOur cereal business reported a decline for the full year, although we continued to reflect improving trends throughout the year, and we reported consumption growth and share gains in the fourth quarter as our business continues to improve ahead of category trends. Our six core cereals in combination (Special K\u00ae, Raisin Bran\u00ae, Frosted Flakes\u00ae, Mini-Wheats\u00ae, Froot Loops\u00ae, and Rice Krispies\u00ae) gained share and increased consumption for the year, with even stronger growth in both share and consumption in the fourth quarter. Special K\u00ae posted consumption growth and share gains for the year and even stronger results for the fourth quarter driven primarily by the renovation work we completed on Special K\u00ae Red Berries. The good growth we saw all year on Raisin Bran\u00ae was the result of great advertising and the introduction of Raisin Bran\u00ae with Cranberries.\nWe expect to continue driving sales in 2016 with the introduction of new products like Special K\u00ae Nourish, a cereal with positive nutrition and ingredients the consumer can see, and the food includes fruits, nuts and on-trend grains like quinoa. Initial response on this innovation has been encouraging. In addition, we're launching Mini-Wheats\u00ae Harvest Delights, Smorz\u00ae, and Disney Dory\u00ae-themed cereal.\nToaster pastries reported a slight sales decline for the year. Health and wellness bars and beverages each reported a sales decline.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit increased 2.1% due to improved gross margins resulting from lower input costs and Project K savings as well as lower brand-building investment. This was partially offset by the sales performance, increased distribution costs, and resetting of incentive compensation levels.\nU.S. Snacks\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 1.6% as a result of decreased volume which was partially offset by favorable pricing/mix. This segment consists of crackers, cereal bars, cookies, savory snacks, and fruit-flavored snacks.\nCrackers posted a sales decline as consumption declined across several of our products, while consumption increased for our Big 3 brands in combination (Cheez-It\u00ae , Town House\u00ae, and Club\u00ae). The consumption decline was due primarily to weakness in Special K\u00ae Cracker Chips during the first half of the year and full-year weakness in Special K\u00ae Popcorn Chips. The Special K\u00ae Cracker Chips products we restaged earlier this year posted consumption growth for the past two quarters as a result of improvements in packaging and food. We expect the impact of the remaining skus to lessen as we progress through 2016. The consumption increase for our Big 3 brands was primarily the result of strong consumption and share gains in Cheez-It\u00ae due to the Cheez-It\u00ae Grooves and Cheez-It\u00ae Extra Toasty innovations.\nThe bars business declined due to weakness in the Special K\u00ae and Fiber Plus\u00ae brands. The performance of our Special K bars has improved in the second half of the year as a result of new products and renovation that occurred early in the year and good results from Special K\u00ae Chewy Nut bars that were launched in mid-2015. Rice Krispies Treats\u00ae reported double-digit consumption gains and gained share as a result of good core growth and innovation.\nThe cookies business consumption declined for the year resulting in lost share, although we have seen improving trends over the second half of 2015 as a result of good performance in Chips Deluxe\u00ae, Fudge Shoppe\u00ae, and Famous Amos\u00ae due to expanded distribution, new products, and increased in-store activity. We have great brands in the category and we have some exciting new introductions planned for 2016. We are also going to give the brands new support in 2016, including the relaunch of advertising featuring the Keebler\u00ae Elves.\nSavory snacks reported low-single-digit growth as a result of consumption growth due to core products and innovations. The Pringles\u00ae business had a good year including strength in the on-the-go segment. As we enter the\nnew year we are adding new capacity and we have good plans; as a result, we look forward to a strong 2016.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined by 11.3% due to unfavorable sales performance and the resetting of incentive compensation levels.\nU.S. Specialty\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales increased 0.7% as a result of favorable pricing/mix which was partially offset by decreased volume. Sales growth was reported in the Convenience and Vending channels, partially offset by a slight decline in Foodservice partially due to the exit of some unprofitable business early in the year.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined by 0.8% due to the resetting of incentive compensation levels which more than offset the favorable sales performance.\nNorth America Other\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 3.2% due to decreased volume and unfavorable pricing/mix.\nThe U.S. Frozen business reported a net sales decline due to the impact from egg prices, network improvements, and a decision to draw down inventories due to changes in packaging from boxes to bags for our veggie foods business. The packaging conversion is going well, but we expect sales to continue to be impacted in the first quarter of 2016 and for performance to improve over the balance of the year. The Eggo\u00ae hand-held sandwiches posted double-digit consumption growth and share gains for the year.\nThe Canada business reported a broad-based net sales increase across several categories for the year. For 2016, the Canadian team is planning introductions of new products and improved support, much like the rest of the North American region.\nKashi reported a double-digit net sales decline although the business continues to experience stabilized distribution and sequential improvement across the last two quarters in part due to the impact of the introduction of new products in the second half of 2015. Bear Naked\u00ae Granola posted double-digit consumption growth for the year. We expect continued improvement in 2016 due to further improvement in distribution and the impact of a focus on new products high in protein from plants.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined 16.1% primarily due to unfavorable sales performance in the U.S. Frozen and Kashi businesses, net cost inflation including transactional currency expense in the Canadian business and increased material costs in the U.S. Frozen business, and the resetting of incentive compensation levels.\nEurope\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 0.6% as a result of relatively flat volume and unfavorable pricing/mix.\nThe Pringles\u00ae business posted strong, double-digit net sales growth as a result of good promotions, innovations and distribution gains throughout the year. Both the base business and the launch of Pringles\u00ae Tortilla in the UK and Germany contributed. We have some exciting activity planned for Pringles\u00ae in 2016 as well, including soccer-themed activity planned to coincide with the Euros soccer tournament in the summer and the continued roll-out of Pringles\u00ae Tortilla in the region.\nThe wholesome snacks business posted growth in the second half of the year. This was due to better results in the UK driven in part by Disney\u00ae-branded snacks, mini biscuits, Crunchy Nut\u00ae, and Rice Krispies Squares\u00ae. In addition, the Russian business did well. We also have new foods coming across the region in 2016.\nThe Cereal business in Europe declined due to challenges in the category in many of the countries. However, we improved our plans for Special K\u00ae and Crunchy Nut\u00ae in the UK, saw good performance from Extra\u00ae in Italy, and\ninvested behind Kellogg's\u00ae-branded granola in Germany. Also, we recently launched the Ancient Legends\u00ae brands in the region. These are great products, which include on-trend ingredients like spelt, apples, sultanas, and chia seeds. We are also applying learnings from our US cereal business including the renovation of Special K\u00ae Red Berries, the launch of Special K\u00ae Nourish, and we're also adding more fun in the box.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit improved 4.3% due to net cost deflation and strong savings, including savings from Project K.\nLatin America\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales improved 24.6% due to favorable volume and pricing/mix, including the impact of pricing actions in Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, currency-neutral comparable net sales would have grown 1.3%.\nWe experienced volume growth in several of our markets, including Mexico. We also realized strong price realization in Venezuela as a result of pricing actions taken to offset cost inflation. Cereal sales in the region increased and we have held or gained share in most of the region. These share gains have been driven by children's and family brands and the introduction of Kellogg-branded granolas and muesli products.\nSales in the snacks business also increased driven by innovation and go-to-market activity. The Pringles\u00ae business continued to perform well and we have launched Pringles\u00ae Tortilla in the region.\nOur focus on high-frequency stores continues to drive results. We've seen results in Convenience and mini-Super stores in Mexico, and in smaller stores in Colombia. We have also had success driving sales growth through packaging initiatives designed to drive affordability and accessibility in various areas of the business.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit improved by 15.4% due to favorable price realization which was partially offset by net cost inflation. Excluding Venezuela, currency neutral comparable operating profit declined 3.4% as sales growth and margin expansion were more than offset by increased investment in brand-building and business capabilities.\nAsia Pacific\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales increased 4.0% as a result of increased volume which was partially offset by unfavorable pricing/mix. Unfavorable pricing/mix was primarily the result of country mix.\nThe sales increase was the result of double-digit growth in the Asian markets, double-digit growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, and mid-single-digit growth in the savory snacks business across the region. The growth in Asia included double-digit sales growth in Japan driven by the continued growth of the granola category and the impact of new packaging as well as double-digit growth in Korea and Southeast Asia. The savory snacks business reported broad-based sales growth and share gains due to innovation and gains in distribution.\nThis sales performance was partially offset by weakness in the Australian cereal category. However, the granola and m\u00fcesli segments are growing well and we have a plan to address the weakness in the overall Australian business in 2016. We are also applying lessons learned in our US business to our Australia business.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined 3.7% as our investment of Project K savings into emerging markets in the region behind brand investments and capabilities more than offset the favorable sales performance.\nCorporate\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined due to the resetting of incentive compensation levels which was partially offset by reduced pension costs.\n2014 compared to 2013\nThe following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for

net sales declined 4.8% as a result of unfavorable volume and pricing/mix. This segment consists of cereal, toaster pastries, health and wellness bars, and beverages.\nThe cereal category continued to decline through the year despite our continued investments behind category-building programs that started early in the year. Much of our decline in the cereal category has come from Special K\u00ae. We experienced weakness in Special K\u00ae as it faced headwinds from evolving consumer trends regarding weight management. As a result, we changed the positioning of the brand from a focus on dieting to weight wellness. This focus will stress the role that Special K\u00ae plays in a healthy lifestyle. We have begun the execution of this new positioning for the overall cereal business through the following initiatives:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We have launched the See You at Breakfast campaign and the Open for Breakfast digital program designed to help us connect directly with consumers\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We are revitalizing the Special K\u00ae brand and are launching new products such as Special K\u00ae Gluten-free and Special K\u00ae Protein\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect that these actions will have a positive impact on the performance of the Special K\u00ae, and on the cereal business as a whole. Our plan for investment is long-term and the levels, content, and effectiveness of the support will evolve, and increase over time.\nToaster pastries reported a sales decline for the year as a result of difficult comparisons due to the peanut butter innovations launched in 2013. However we did gain share for the year and introduced a new PB&J innovation in November and we expect this to improve sales results. Health and wellness bars and beverages each reported a sales decline for the year.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined 10.0% due to the unfavorable sales performance and a mid-single-digit increase in cereal brand-building investment. This was partially offset by a decrease in brand-building investment behind health and wellness bars and beverages, and continued cost discipline.\nU.S. Snacks\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 2.8% as a result of decreased volume partially offset by favorable pricing/mix. This segment consists of crackers, cereal bars, cookies, savory snacks, and fruit-flavored snacks.\nCrackers posted a slight sales increase and gained share as a result of the continued success of Cheez-It\u00ae innovations and core products in the Town House\u00ae, and Club\u00ae brands due to brand-building support and sales execution. Cheez-It\u00ae, Town House\u00ae, and Club\u00ae all reported solid consumption and share gains. The gains in these three brands have been offset by weakness in Special K\u00ae Cracker Chips due to similar consumer trends that we have experienced in the cereal category. We have addressed this weakness by launching completely restaged Cracker Chips with new flavors, better flavor and texture profiles, improved packaging, and new positioning. This new product started to arrive in stores in late 2014.\nThe bars business declined due to weakness in the Special K\u00ae and Fiber Plus\u00ae brands. The issues with these brands are similar to what we have experienced in the cereal category. To address these issues we launched new products and activities in the fourth quarter of this year and will launch more new, great-tasting Special K\u00ae snack bars with new packaging and new positioning. This activity ties into the initiatives we are launching in other categories and regions around the world. This new product started to arrive in stores in late December. Rice Krispies Treats\u00ae and Nutri-grain\u00ae both reported consumption gains and gained share as a result of good core growth and innovation.\nThe cookies business declined resulting in lost share. However we saw share gains from Chips Deluxe\u00ae as a result of new co-branded products. We experienced soft performance in our 100-calorie packs business throughout the year. We are migrating consumers to an expanded line of single-serve products, which should help to reduce the impact of the decline. We also experienced the negative impact of a SKU rationalization initiative.\nSavory snacks reported mid-single-digit sales growth and held share for the year behind the performance of the core business, Grab \u2018n Go, and the new Pringles\u00ae Tortilla product.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined by 10.9% due to unfavorable sales performance and net cost inflation. This was partially offset by continued cost discipline.\nU.S. Specialty\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 1.2% as a result of decreased volume and unfavorable pricing/mix. Sales declines were the result of the negative impact of weather early in the year, supply issues with a co-packer, and an inventory de-load as a customer shifted from warehouse to direct delivery.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined by 1.5% due to the unfavorable sales performance. This was partially offset by cost discipline.\nNorth America Other\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 3.2% due to decreased volume and unfavorable pricing/mix.\nThe U.S. Frozen business reported a decline due to unfavorable comparisons early in the year resulting from strong prior-year growth behind innovation activity and costs later in the year associated with the launch of new products. New Eggo\u00ae Bites and Eggo\u00ae handheld sandwiches performed well during the year. The combination of the Eggo\u00ae handheld sandwiches and good results from our Special K\u00ae handheld sandwiches resulted in a double-digit sales increase for our sandwich business during our final quarter of the year. Consumption of Eggo\u00ae waffles is improving as we have re-launched the L'Eggo My Eggo\u00ae brand-building program and launched Eggo\u00ae gluten-free and a new variety of Thick-n-Fluffy waffles.\nCanada reported a slight increase in sales driven primarily by the snacks business as volumes increased at a low single-digit rate.\nKashi reported a decline in sales as we continued to experience softness in the cereal category. We have identified areas of focus for Kashi\u00ae which is a great brand in a category that is on trend. We have begun the execution of this new positioning through the following initiatives:\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>All Kashi Go-Lean\u00ae products will be Non GMO Project Verified\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>All Kashi Heart-to-Heart\u00ae products will meet the USDA's Organic standard\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect that these initiatives will have a positive impact on the performance of Kashi\u00ae.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined 3.8% primarily due to unfavorable sales performance. This was partially offset by continued cost discipline.\nEurope\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 0.8% as a result of flat volume and unfavorable pricing/mix. Cereal category consumption remains soft in most developed markets, similar to the cereal category in the U.S. Emerging markets reported good growth for the year in both cereal and snacks. To address the cereal category softness, we executed brand-building activities in the second half of the year. New Special K\u00ae advertising has recently gone on air which addresses the recent health and wellness trends that have negatively impacted this brand.\nSavory snacks performed well throughout the year, with the final quarter of 2014 reporting the highest sales since we acquired the business. New products are launching, including Pringles\u00ae Tortilla, and we have more capacity coming on-line mid-year.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit improved 7.4% due to net cost deflation, including strong productivity savings, and decreased brand-building investment. This was partially offset by unfavorable sales performance.\nLatin America\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales improved 3.9% due to favorable pricing/mix which was partially offset by decreased volume. Strong price realization, primarily from Venezuela, has more than offset sales declines early in the year resulting from the volume elasticity impact of the introduction of a new food tax in Mexico. We reported growth in Venezuela, Mercosur, and the Pringles business as well as pricing gains in a majority of our markets. The\ncereal business posted good results, although we saw some competitive price promotions in Mexico which affected selected segments. The momentum of the savory snacks business continues, driven by strong commercial programs, innovation, and good execution.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit improved by 9.0% due to favorable sales performance which was partially offset by net cost inflation, increased brand-building investment to support innovation and new programs, and increased overhead investment.\nAsia Pacific\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales increased 0.8% as a result of flat volume and favorable pricing/mix. The sales increase was the result of double-digit growth in the Asian markets and high-single-digit growth in the savory snacks business across the region. This sales performance was partially offset by weakness in the Australian cereal category and our performance in South Africa as we conducted construction work early in the year and it took longer than expected to bring the plant back on line.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined 7.3% due to the weakness in the Australian cereal category and our performance in South Africa. This was partially offset by cost discipline.\nCorporate\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit improved as a result of reduced pension costs which was partially offset by increased overhead investments.\nMargin performance\n2015 versus 2014 margin performance was as follows:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Excluding the impact of Venezuela, currency-neutral comparable gross margin would have increased by 20 basis points as a result of productivity savings, Project K savings, and deflation in commodities and packaging which was partially offset by higher distribution costs and investment in our foods such as the launch of granolas and mueslis across the globe and the renovation of existing foods such as Special K\u00ae.\nCurrency-neutral comparable SG&A% was worse by 40 basis points as a result of resetting incentive compensation, reinvestment of Project K savings into sales capabilities including adding sales representatives, and re-establishing the Kashi business unit which was partially offset by improvements resulting from efficiency and effectiveness programs as well as decreased brand

information on reconciling items in the table above, please refer to the Significant items impacting comparability section.\nRestructuring and cost reduction activities\nWe view our continued spending on restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our long-term profit growth targets. Initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a five-year period of completion. Upon completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi-year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation.\nProject K\nProject K, a four-year efficiency and effectiveness program, was announced in November 2013, and is expected to generate a significant amount of savings that may be invested in key strategic areas of focus for the business. We expect that this investment will drive future growth in revenues, gross margin, operating profit, and cash flow.\nThe focus of the program will be to strengthen existing businesses in core markets, increase growth in developing and emerging markets, and drive an increased level of value-added innovation. The program is expected to provide a number of benefits, including an optimized supply chain infrastructure, the implementation of global business services, and a new global focus on categories.\nWe currently anticipate that Project K will result in total pre-tax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, of $1.2 to $1.4 billion, with after-tax cash costs, including incremental capital investments, estimated to be $900 million to $1.1 billion. Cash expenditures of approximately $625 million have been incurred through the end of fiscal year 2015. Total cash expenditures, as defined, are expected to be approximately $150 million for 2016 and the balance of $125 to $325 million thereafter. Total charges for Project K in 2016 are expected to be approximately $175 to $200 million.\nWe expect annual cost savings generated from Project K will be approximately $425 to $475 million by 2018, with approximately two-thirds of the cost savings to be realized in cost of goods sold. We have realized approximately $180 million of annual savings through the end of 2015. We expect approximately $100 million of incremental savings in 2016, approximately 75 to 80 percent of which will come from cost of goods sold. Cost savings will be utilized to increase margins and drive sales growth through additional investments in advertising, in-store execution, sales capabilities, including adding sales representatives, re-establishing the Kashi business unit, and in the design and quality of our products. We will also invest in production capacity in developing and emerging markets, and in global category teams.\nAs a result of Project K, capital spending levels were increased to 4% of net sales during both 2014 and 2015. Our on-going business model assumes capital spending to be approximately 3-4% of net sales annually.\nThus far, we have funded much of the cash requirements for Project K through our supplier financing initiative. Due to the difference in timing between expected cash costs for the project and expected future cash savings, we anticipate funding the project through a combination of cash on hand and short-term debt.\nWe also expect that the project will have an impact on our consolidated effective income tax rate during the execution of the project due to the timing of charges being taken in different tax jurisdictions. The impact of this project on our consolidated effective income tax rate will be excluded from the comparable income tax rate that will be disclosed on a quarterly basis.\nRefer to Note 4 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to Project K and other restructuring activities.\nOther Projects\nIn 2015 we initiated the implementation of a zero-based budgeting (ZBB) program in our North America business. This ZBB program is expected to deliver visibility to $100 million in annual savings in North America during 2016. We will begin to expand ZBB into our international businesses during 2016 with modest savings expected in certain locations in 2016. We expect increased savings to be realized in our international businesses in 2017 and beyond.\nIn support of the ZBB initiative, we incurred pre-tax charges of approximately $12 million in 2015. We anticipate that ZBB will result in cumulative pre-tax charges of approximately $25 to $50 million through 2016 which will consist primarily of the design and implementation of business capabilities.\nForeign currency translation\nThe reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in the euro, British pound, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Venezuelan bolivar fuerte, and Russian ruble. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates. As a result, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. This could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar is substantial.\nInterest expense\nAnnual interest expense is illustrated in the following table. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to a higher average level of long-term debt and to higher interest rates, partially resulting from lower levels of debt swapped to a variable rate. The decline in 2014 was primarily due to refinancing of maturing long-term debt at lower interest rates and lower interest rates on long-term debt which has effectively been converted to floating rate obligations through the use of interest rate swaps. Interest income (recorded in other income (expense), net) was (in millions), 2015-$4; 2014-$8; 2013-$7. We currently expect that our 2016 gross interest expense will be approximately $235 to $245 million.\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change vs.\nprior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reported interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts capitalized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.7)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome taxes\nOur reported effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 20.6%, 22.6% and 30.4% respectively. Comparable effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 25.6%, 28.2%, and 28.4%, respectively.\nThe 2015 and 2014 effective income tax rates benefited from the mark-to-market loss recorded for our pension plans. Refer to Note 12 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon U.S. dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates. Additionally, the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters, including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives, are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of as reported to currency-neutral comparable income taxes and effective income tax rate for 2015 and 2014.\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td>

impacting comparability section.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions. Our cash-generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs.\nWe have historically reported negative working capital primarily as the result of our focus to improve core working capital by reducing our levels of trade receivables and inventory while extending the timing of payment of our trade payables. In addition, we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which results in current maturities of long-term debt and notes payable which can have a significant impact on working capital as a result of the timing of these required payments. These factors, coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, pay dividends, fund acquisition opportunities, and repurchase our common stock, reduce our working capital amounts. We had negative working capital of $2.5 billion and $1.0 billion as of January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, respectively.\nWe believe that our operating cash flows, together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that volatility and/or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nAs of January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, we had $231 million and $257 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents held in international jurisdictions which will be used to fund capital and other cash requirements of international operations. These amounts include $2 million and $68 million at January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, respectively, subject to currency exchange controls in Venezuela, limiting the total amount of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries that can be repatriated at any particular point in time.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,127\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(641\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(706\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,063\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,141\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(192\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities\nThe principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings, meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products, net of costs to manufacture and market our products.\nOur net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 amounted to $1,691 million, a decrease of $102 million compared with 2014. The decrease compared to the prior year is the result of the negative year over year impact of accounts receivable mitigated somewhat by the incremental cash flow benefit from the supplier financing initiative of approximately $210 million. Our net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 amounted to $1,793 million, a decrease of $14 million compared with 2013, due primarily to the negative incremental impact of Project K cash requirements mitigated somewhat by the positive impact from the supplier financing initiative of approximately $210 million.\nAfter-tax cash payments related to Project K were $192 million in 2015, $187 million in 2014, and $18 million in 2013.\nOur cash conversion cycle (defined as days of inventory, excluding inventoriable mark-to-market pension costs, and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding, based on a trailing 12 month average) is relatively short, equating to approximately 14 days and 27 days for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Core working capital in 2015 averaged 6.2% of net sales, compared to 7.6% in 2014 and 7.8% in 2013. In 2015, both our cash conversion cycle and core working capital showed improvements in days of trade payables outstanding which includes the positive impact of a supplier financing initiative. Days of trade receivables and inventory on hand increased slightly from 2014 to 2015.\nOur total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to $33 million, $53 million and $48 million, in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe Pension Protection Act (PPA), and subsequent regulations, determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the United States. We believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under PPA requirements until 2021 or beyond. Our projections concerning timing of PPA funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance, future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the PPA.\nWe currently project that we will make total U.S. and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2016 of approximately $43 million. Actual 2016 contributions could be different from our current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities, future changes in government requirements, trust asset performance, renewals of union contracts, or higher-than-expected health care claims cost experience.\nWe measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. We use this non-GAAP financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases. Our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure, as follows:\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additions to properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(553\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(582\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(637\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>year-over-year change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in cash flow (as defined) in 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to the unfavorable year over year impact of accounts receivable mitigated somewhat by the favorable year over year impact of trade payables as a result of the supplier financing initiative. The increase in cash flow in 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to lower capital expenditures and improved core working capital partially offset by the negative impact of Project K cash requirements.\nInvesting activities\nOur net cash used in investing activities for 2015 amounted to $1,127 million, an increase of $554 million compared with 2014. In 2015, we acquired, for $445 million, a 50% interest in Multipro Singapore Pte. Ltd., a leading distributor of a variety of food products in Nigeria and Ghana, and an option to purchase a minority interest in an affiliated food manufacturer. In addition to our joint venture investment in 2015, we also acquired Mass Foods and a majority interest in Bisco Misr.\nCapital spending in 2015 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure, and to support capacity requirements in certain markets and products, including Pringles in Asia-Pacific.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $573 million in 2014 decreased $68 million compared with 2013.\nCash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales increased to 4.1% in 2015, from 4.0% in 2014, which was a decrease from 4.3% in 2013.\nFinancing activities\nOur net cash used by financing activities was $706 million, $1,063 million and $1,141 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The use of cash in financing activities compared to the prior year declined due primarily to net proceeds from notes payable of $374 million in 2015 versus $89 million in 2014.\nTotal debt was $7.8 billion and $7.4 billion at year-end 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn May 2015, we repaid our $350 million 1.125% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2015 at maturity.\nIn February 2015, we repaid our floating-rate $250 million U.S. Dollar Notes due 2015 at maturity and in March 2015, we issued \u20ac600 million of ten-year 1.25% Euro Notes due 2025.\nIn March 2014, we redeemed $150 million of our 4.00% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2020, $342 million of our 3.125% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2022 and $189 million of our 2.75% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2023. In connection with the debt redemption, we incurred $1 million of interest expense, offset by $8 million of accelerated gains on interest rate hedges previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, and incurred $5 million expense, recorded in Other Income, Expense (net), related to acceleration of fees on the redeemed debt and fees related to the tender offer.\nIn May 2014, we issued \u20ac500 million of seven-year 1.75% Euro Notes due 2021, using the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which included repayment of a portion of our commercial paper borrowings.\nIn May 2014, we issued Cdn. $300 million of three-year 2.05% Canadian Dollar Notes due 2017, using the proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay our Cdn. $300 million, 2.10% Notes due May 2014 at maturity.\nIn February 2013, we issued $250 million of two-year floating-rate U.S. Dollar Notes, and $400 million of ten-year 2.75% U.S. Dollar Notes, resulting in aggregate net proceeds after debt discount of $645 million. The proceeds from these Notes were used for general corporate purposes, including, together with cash on hand, repayment of the $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% U.S. Dollar Notes due March 2013.\nIn April 2013, the board of directors approved a $1 billion share repurchase program expiring in April 2014. In February 2014, the board of directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion in shares through December 2015. In December 2015, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to $1.5 billion beginning in 2016 through December 2017.\nDuring 2015, we purchased 11 million shares totaling $731 million. During 2014, we purchased 11 million shares totaling $690 million. In May 2013, we entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) Agreement with a financial institution counterparty and paid $355 million for the purchase of shares during the term of the agreement which extended through August 2013. The total number of shares delivered upon settlement of the ASR was based upon the volume weighted average price of the Company's stock over the term of the agreement. Total shares\npurchased in 2013, including shares delivered under the ASR, amounted to approximately 9 million shares totaling $544 million.\nWe paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling $1.98 per share in 2015, $1.90 per share in 2014 and $1.80 per share in 2013. Total cash paid for dividends increased by 3.0% in 2015 and 4.0% in 2014. In February 2016, the board of directors declared a dividend of $.50 per common share, payable on March 15, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2016.\nIn February 2014, we entered into an unsecured Five-Year Credit Agreement to replace the existing unsecured Four-Year Credit Agreement, which would have expired in March 2015. The Five-Year Credit Agreement allows us to borrow, on a revolving credit basis, up to $2.0 billion.\nOur long-term debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit Kellogg Company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and lease-back transactions. Some agreements also contain change in control provisions. However, they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings. A change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the U.S. short-term debt market and/or increase the cost of refinancing long-term debt in the future. However, even under these circumstances, we would continue to have access to our Five-Year Credit Agreement, which expires in February 2019. This source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis, although we do not currently plan to use it.\nWe monitor the financial strength of our third-party financial institutions, including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities, our derivative financial instruments, and other arrangements.\nWe are in compliance with all covenants as of January 2, 2016. We continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future, while still meeting our operational needs, including the pursuit of selected bolt-on acquisitions. This will be accomplished through our strong cash flow, our short-term borrowings, and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis. We anticipate establishing a discrete customer program which would allow for extended customer payment terms. In connection with this program, we may enter into an agreement with one or more financial institutions to monetize these receivables resulting in the receivables being de-recognized from our consolidated balance sheet. We currently estimate that the amount of these receivables held at any time by the financial institution(s) will be approximately $500 to $600 million.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nAs of January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015 we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at January 2, 2016:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 and\nbeyond\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>942\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uncertain tax positions (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term obligations (f)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Includes interest payments on our long-term debt and payments on our interest rate swaps.

The costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer. These estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. Differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. On a full-year basis, these subsequent period adjustments represent approximately 0.4% of our company's net sales. However, our company's total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a revenue reduction) are significant, so it is likely our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.\nProperty\nLong-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Management evaluates several conditions, including, but not limited to, the following: a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, including an extended period of idleness; and a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. For assets to be held and used, we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the long-lived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset. If the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data. There are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses.\nAt January 2, 2016, we have property, plant and equipment of $3.6 billion, net of accumulated depreciation, on our balance sheet. Included in this amount are approximately $51 million of idle assets.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\nWe perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process.\nGoodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. For the 2015 goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples. Our approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units. In the event the fair value determined using the market multiples approach is close to the carrying value, we may also supplement our fair value determination using discounted cash flows. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units.\nSimilarly, impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset. Fair values of non-goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset. For instance, cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants. These estimates are made using various inputs including historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market comparables.\nWe also evaluate the useful life over which a non-goodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.\nAt January 2, 2016, goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to $7.2 billion, consisting primarily of goodwill and brands associated with the 2001 acquisition of Keebler Foods Company and the 2012 acquisition of Pringles. Within this total, approximately $2.2 billion of non-goodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinite-lived, comprised principally of Keebler and Pringles trademarks. We currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows. The percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the U.S. Snacks reporting unit was approximately 43% and 59% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. However, if we had used materially different assumptions, which we do not believe are reasonably possible, regarding the future performance of our business or a different market multiple in the valuation, this could have resulted in significant impairment losses. Additionally, we have $25 million of goodwill related to our 2008 acquisition of United Bakers in Russia. Fair value of the intangibles for this business exceeded carrying value in 2015. If we used modestly different assumptions regarding sales multiples and EBITDA in the valuation, this could have resulted in an impairment loss. Management will continue to monitor the situation closely.\nRetirement benefits\nOur company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the United States and Canada. Plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance. A substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments. We recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees' active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans. Inherent in this concept is the requirement to\nuse various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date. Major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the health care cost trend rates, the mortality table and improvement scale, and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans, which cover employees in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.\nOur expense recognition policy for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits is to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually as of our measurement date, which is our fiscal year-end, or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles.\nAdditionally, for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits we use the fair value of plan assets.\nTo conduct our annual review of the long-term rate of return on plan assets, we model expected returns over a 20-year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans. The return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long-term bonds, price-earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and long-term inflation. Our U.S. plan model, corresponding to approximately 68% of our trust assets globally, currently incorporates a long-term inflation assumption of 2.5% and an active management premium of 1% (net of fees) validated by historical analysis and future return expectations. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return annually, our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our expected rates of return have generally not been revised, provided these rates continue to fall within a more likely than not\u201d corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected long-term returns, as determined by our modeling process. Our assumed rate of return for U.S. plans in 2016 of 8.5% equates to approximately the 57th percentile expectation of our model. Similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets, reflecting local economic conditions. Foreign trust investments represent approximately 32% of our global benefit plan assets.\nBased on consolidated benefit plan assets at January 2, 2016, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would correspondingly increase or decrease 2016 benefits expense by approximately\n$55 million. For each of the three fiscal years, our actual return on plan assets exceeded (was less than) the recognized assumed return by the following amounts (in millions): 2015-$(666); 2014-$(41); 2013-$545.\nTo conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates, we model our actual claims cost data over a five-year historical period, including an analysis of pre-65 versus post-65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population. This data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends. Our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short-term future trends. In comparison to our actual five-year compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 4.95%, our initial trend rate for 2016 of 5.00% reflects the expected future impact of faster-growing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population. Our initial rate is trended downward by 0.25% per year, until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5% is reached. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Based on consolidated obligations at January 2, 2016, a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2016 benefits expense by approximately $4 million and generate an immediate loss recognition of $89 million. A 100 basis point excess of 2016 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an experience loss of approximately $4 million and would increase 2016 expense by $0.2 million. Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur. The experience loss arising from recognition of 2015 claims experience was approximately $3 million.\nAssumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize. At the end of 2014, we revised our mortality assumption after considering the Society of Actuaries' (SOA) updated mortality tables and improvement scale, as well as other mortality information available from the Social Security Administration to develop assumptions aligned with our expectation of future improvement rates. In determining the appropriate mortality assumptions as of January 2, 2016, we considered the SOA's 2015 updated improvement scale and believe our assumption remains appropriate.\nTo conduct our annual review of discount rates, we selected the discount rate based on a cash-flow matching analysis using Willis Towers Watson's proprietary RATE:Link tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans. RATE:Link establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments, as is generated by discounting each year's benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. The spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of U.S. high quality bonds. A similar methodology is applied in Canada and Europe, except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable. We use a December 31 measurement date for our defined benefit plans. Accordingly, we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during December of each year.\nBased on consolidated obligations at January 2, 2016, a 25 basis point decline in the weighted-average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would decrease 2016 benefits expense by approximately $2 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of $222 million. All obligation-related actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur.\nDespite the previously-described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions, we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience. During 2015, we recognized a net actuarial loss of approximately $418 million compared to a net actuarial loss of approximately $918 million in 2014. Of the total net loss recognized in 2015, approximately $(245) million was related primarily to favorable changes in the discount rate and other assumptions and $666 million was related to asset losses and $(3) million was related to a discrete benefit resulting from certain events affecting our benefit programs. Of the $918 million net loss recognized in 2014, approximately $911 million was related to unfavorable changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions, and $41 million was related to asset losses, and $(34) million was related to a discrete benefit resulting from certain events affecting our benefit programs.\nDuring 2015, we made contributions in the amount of $19 million to Kellogg's global tax-qualified pension programs. This amount was mostly non-discretionary. Additionally we contributed $14 million to our retiree medical programs.\nIncome taxes\nOur consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment. Income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is expected to be remitted to and taxable in the United States.\nWe recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, new or emerging legislation and tax planning. The tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. Significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of Note 12 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED IN FUTURE PERIODS\nRecognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption can be elected for all financial statements of fiscal years and interim periods that have not yet been issued or that have not yet been made available for issuance. Entities should apply the update by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2018. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nBalance sheet classification of deferred taxes. In November 2015, the FASB issued an ASU to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The ASU requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Entities should apply the new guidance either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating when we will adopt the updated standard and whether to use the prospective or retrospective method. Our year-end 2015 balance for current deferred tax assets and liabilities was $227 and $9 million, respectively. Please see Note 12 for more information on our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nSimplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments. In September 2015, the FASB issued an ASU to simplify the accounting for measurement-period adjustments for items in a business combination. The ASU requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Entities should apply the new guidance prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the ASU with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. We will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nSimplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. In April 2015, the FASB issued an ASU to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. The ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Entities should apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis. We will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nCustomer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. In April 2015, the FASB issued an ASU to help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Entities should apply the new guidance either; 1) prospectively to all arrangements entered into or\nmaterially modified after the effective date or 2) retrospectively. We will adopt the updated standard prospectively in the first quarter of 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nRevenue from contracts with customers. In May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU which provides guidance for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of this ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity would be required to apply the following five steps: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. When the ASU was originally issued it was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption was not permitted. On July 9, 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. The updated standard will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Entities will be permitted to adopt the new revenue standard early, but not before the original effective date. Entities will have the option to apply the final standard retrospectively or use a modified retrospective method, recognizing the cumulative effect of the ASU in retained earnings at the date of initial application. An entity will not restate prior periods if it uses the modified retrospective method, but will be required to disclose the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period by the application of the ASU as compared to the guidance in effect prior to the change, as well as reasons for significant changes. We will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact that implementing this ASU will have on our financial statements and disclosures, as well as whether we will use the retrospective or modified retrospective method of adoption.\nFUTURE OUTLOOK\nWe expect during 2016 that Project K and zero-based budgeting savings will enable us to continue to invest in our businesses, our foods, and the categories in which we compete. We expect currency-neutral comparable net sales growth to be in the range of 1 to 3 percent. While our original 2016 guidance always included pricing to cover the impact of inflation in Venezuela, our latest outlook includes more pricing to offset inflation. While it is difficult to predict pricing actions that will be required in Venezuela, it is possible that currency-neutral comparable net sales growth could exceed our guidance range due to Venezuela.\nWe also expect currency-neutral comparable gross margin to be up slightly due to deflation resulting from material costs, savings from Project K and zero-based budgeting. This expectation for currency-neutral comparable gross margin excludes the impact of highly inflationary economies. Finally, we expect currency-neutral comparable operating profit growth in the range of 4 to 6 percent and currency-neutral comparable EPS to increase in the range of 6 to 8 percent.\nWe expect that full-year operating cash flow will be approximately $1.1 billion, including capital spending in the range of 4 to 5 percent of net sales. This capital spending expectation reflects much lower capital spending for Project K, but increased capital spending to support growth in our Pringles business.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nKellogg Company and Subsidiaries\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBusiness overview\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand Kellogg Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report.\nFor more than 100 years, consumers have counted on Kellogg for great-tasting, high-quality and nutritious foods. Kellogg is the world's leading producer of cereal, second largest producer of cookies and crackers, and a leading producer of savory snacks and frozen foods. Additional product offerings include toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit-flavored snacks and veggie foods. Kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally.\nSegments and growth targets\nDuring Q1 2015, we established a new Kashi operating segment in order to optimize future growth potential of this business. This operating segment is included in the North America Other reportable segment. Including this new operating segment, we manage our operations through nine operating segments that are based on product category or geographic location. These operating segments are evaluated for similarity with regards to economic characteristics, products, production processes, types or classes of customers, distribution methods and regulatory environments to determine if they can be aggregated into reportable segments. We report results of operations in the following reportable segments: U.S. Morning Foods; U.S. Snacks; U.S. Specialty; North America Other; Europe; Latin America; and Asia Pacific. The reportable segments are discussed in greater detail in Note 17 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe manage our Company for sustainable performance defined by our long-term annual growth targets. Our targeted long-term annual growth is low-single-digit (1 to 3%) for currency-neutral comparable net sales, mid-single-digit (4 to 6%) for currency-neutral comparable operating profit, and high-single-digit (7 to 9%) for currency-neutral comparable diluted net earnings per share (EPS).\nSignificant items impacting comparability\nProject K and cost reduction activities\nDuring 2013, we announced Project K, a four-year efficiency and effectiveness program. The program is expected to generate a significant amount of savings that may be invested in key strategic areas of focus for the business. We expect that this investment will drive future growth in revenues, gross margin, operating profit, and cash flow. We recorded pre-tax charges related primarily to Project K of $311 million in 2015, $298 million in 2014, and $250 million in 2013.\nIn 2015 we initiated the implementation of a zero-based budgeting (ZBB) program in our North America business. In support of the ZBB initiative, we incurred pre-tax charges of approximately $12 million in 2015.\nSee the Restructuring and cost reduction activities section for more information.\nAcquisitions and dispositions\nIn September 2015, we completed the acquisition of Mass Foods, Egypt's leading cereal company for $46 million, or $44 million net of cash and cash equivalents acquired. The acquisition added $4 million in incremental net sales to our reported results in the European reportable segment for 2015. The acquisition added less than $1 million of incremental operating profit (before transaction and integration costs) to our reported results for 2015.\nIn January 2015, we completed the acquisition of a majority interest in Bisco Misr, the number one packaged biscuits company in Egypt for $125 million, or $117 million net of cash and cash equivalents acquired. The acquisition added $54 million in incremental net sales to our reported results in the European reportable segment for 2015. The acquisition added $4 million of incremental operating profit (before transaction and integration costs) to our reported results for 2015.\nDuring the quarter ended September 27, 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell our vegan and vegetarian canned-meat substitute business unit under the Loma Linda brand to Atlantic Natural Foods (ANF), LLC of Nashville, N.C. The disposition negatively impacted reported net sales in the U.S. Specialty reportable segment by approximately $9 million in 2015.\nIntegration and transaction costs\nWe have incurred integration and transaction costs related to the 2015 acquisitions of Bisco Misr and Mass Foods, the 2015 entry into a joint venture with Tolaram Africa, and the 2012 acquisition of Pringles as we move these businesses into the Kellogg business model. We recorded pre-tax integration and transaction costs of $30 million in 2015. We also recorded pre-tax integration costs of $43 million and $65 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nMark-to-market accounting for pension plans, commodities and certain foreign currency contracts\nWe recognize mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans, commodity contracts, and certain foreign currency contracts as incurred. Actuarial gains/losses for pension plans are recognized in the year they occur. Changes between contract and market prices for commodities contracts and certain foreign currency contracts result in gains/losses that are recognized in the quarter they occur. We recorded pre-tax mark-to-market charges of $446 million, $784 million, and a benefit of $947 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.\nOther costs impacting comparability\nIn 2015, a series of previously executed agreements between Kellogg's and a third party variable interest entity (VIE) were terminated resulting in our determination that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, we deconsolidated the financial statements of the VIE. As a result of the agreement terminations and related settlements, we recognized a loss of $19 million in Other income (expense), net.\nIn connection with the deconsolidation, we derecognized all assets and liabilities of the VIE, including an allocation of a portion of goodwill from the U.S. Snacks operating segment, resulting in a $67 million non-cash gain, which was recorded within operating profit.\nDuring 2014 we incurred $6 million of costs related to the evaluation of potential acquisitions.\nVenezuela remeasurement and long-lived asset impairment\nWhile we continue to qualify for participation in CENCOEX at the official rate, there has been a continued reduction in the level of U.S. dollars available to exchange, in part due to recent declines in the price of oil and the overall decline of the macroeconomic environment within the country. We have experienced an increase in the amount of time it takes to exchange bolivars for U.S. dollars through the CENCOEX exchange during the year. Given this economic backdrop, and upon review of U.S. dollar cash needs in our Venezuela operations as of the quarter ended July 4, 2015, we concluded that we were no longer able to obtain sufficient U.S. dollars on a timely basis through the CENCOEX exchange to support our Venezuela operations resulting in a decision to remeasure our Venezuela subsidiary's financial statements using the SIMADI rate. We have evaluated all of the facts and circumstances surrounding our Venezuelan business and determined that as of January 2, 2016 the SIMADI rate continues to be the appropriate rate to use for remeasuring our Venezuelan subsidiary's financial statements.\nIn connection with the change from the CENCOEX rate to the SIMADI rate that occurred in the quarter ended July 4, 2015, we evaluated the carrying value of our non-monetary assets for impairment and lower of cost or market adjustments. As a result of moving from the CENCOEX official rate to the SIMADI rate, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $152 million, including $112 million in the Latin America operating segment and $40 million in the Corporate operating segment. Of the total charges, $100 million was recorded in COGS, $3 million was recorded in SGA, and $49 million was recorded in Other income (expense), net. These charges consist of $47 million related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan bolivar at the SIMADI exchange rate (recorded in Other income (expense), net), $56 million related to reducing inventory to the lower of cost or market (recorded in COGS) and $49 million related to the impairment of long-lived assets in Venezuela (recorded primarily in COGS).\nAs expected, after moving to the SIMADI rate, our Venezuelan subsidiary utilized assets that continued to be remeasured at historical exchange rates. This resulted in an additional unfavorable impact of $17 million in the Latin America operating segment, including an impact to COGS of $12 million and SGA of $5 million. The total 2015 impact of moving from the CENCOEX official rate to the SIMADI rate was $169 million on a pre-tax basis, or approximately $.42 on a fully-diluted EPS basis.\nAs of January 2, 2016, certain non-monetary assets related to our Venezuelan subsidiary continue to be remeasured at historical exchange rates. As these assets are utilized by our Venezuelan subsidiary during the first half of 2016 they will be recognized in the income statement at historical exchange rates resulting in an unfavorable impact of approximately $4 million.\nShipping day differences\nThe Company's fiscal year normally ends on the Saturday closest to December 31 and as a result, a 53rd week is added approximately every sixth year. The Company's 2014 fiscal year ended on January 3, 2015, and included a 53rd week. While quarters normally consist of 13-week periods, the fourth quarter of 2014 included a 14th week. For comparability, the impact of the 53rd week is excluded from our comparable results. The impact of the fourth quarter 2014 53rd week was $197 million for net sales, $36 million for operating profit and $.07 on a fully-diluted EPS basis.\nForeign currency translation and the impact of Venezuela\nWe evaluate the operating results of our business on a currency-neutral basis. We determine currency-neutral operating results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.\nAs a result of our decision to change the exchange rate that we use to remeasure our Venezuela subsidiary from CENCOEX to the SIMADI exchange rate beginning mid-2015, the methodology we use to calculate the impact of foreign currency translation, as described above, results in certain year-over-year growth rates that require additional commentary. We believe that the use of our standard currency-neutral methodology in combination with the additional commentary provides important information to more fully understand our currency-neutral operating results.\nOur 2015 guidance that was maintained consistently throughout the year reflected an expectation of being approximately flat for currency-neutral comparable net sales and a decline of 2% to 4% for currency-neutral comparable operating profit. Within this guidance, Venezuela was expected to contribute approximately 1% of growth for both currency-neutral comparable net sales and currency-neutral comparable operating profit. In the second half of 2015, the Venezuela business experienced significant unplanned inflation that impacted both currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit that was much larger than anticipated in the guidance. To provide increased visibility into how we have delivered against our 2015 guidance, the commentary below provides both currency-neutral comparable results, which include the entire impact of Venezuela, as well as an adjusted measure that excludes the impact of Venezuela.\nFor the quarter ended January 2, 2016, Latin America currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth were 45.3% and 46.2% respectively. Excluding Venezuela, Latin America currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth would have been approximately 1.4% and 2.0%, respectively.\nFor the year-to-date period ended January 2, 2016, Latin America currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth were 24.6% and 15.4% respectively. Excluding Venezuela, Latin America currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth would have been approximately 1.3% and a decline of 3.4%, respectively.\nFor the quarter ended January 2, 2016, Kellogg Consolidated currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth was 4.2% and 2.8%, respectively. Excluding Venezuela, Kellogg Consolidated currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth would have been approximately 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.\nFor the year-to-date period ended January 2, 2016, Kellogg Consolidated currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth was 1.2% and a decline of 2.3%, respectively. Excluding Venezuela, Kellogg Consolidated currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit would have declined by 0.8% and 3.6%, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nComparability of certain financial measures is affected significantly by several types of financial impacts such as foreign currency translation, integration and transaction costs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans,\ncommodities and certain foreign currency contracts, Project K costs, costs associated with the Venezuela remeasurement and long-lived asset impairment, costs associated with the VIE deconsolidation, differences in shipping days, acquisitions, dispositions, and other costs impacting comparability. To provide increased transparency and assist in understanding our comparable operating performance, we use non-GAAP financial measures within MD&A that exclude these financial impacts.\nNon-GAAP financial measures used include comparable net sales, currency-neutral comparable net sales, comparable net sales growth, currency-neutral comparable net sales growth, comparable gross margin, currency-neutral comparable gross margin, comparable gross profit, currency-neutral comparable gross profit, comparable SGA%, currency-neutral comparable SGA%, comparable operating margin, currency-neutral comparable operating margin, comparable operating profit, currency-neutral comparable operating profit, comparable operating profit growth, currency-neutral comparable operating profit growth, comparable income taxes, currency-neutral comparable income taxes, comparable effective tax rate, currency-neutral comparable effective tax rate, comparable net income attributable to Kellogg Company, currency-neutral comparable net income attributable to Kellogg Company, comparable diluted EPS, currency-neutral comparable diluted EPS, comparable diluted EPS growth, and currency-neutral comparable diluted EPS growth.\nFinancial results\nFor the full year 2015, our reported net sales decreased by 7.2% due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation and shipping day differences from the 53rd week that was recognized in the prior year. Currency-neutral comparable net sales increased by 1.2%, which was better than our expectations, and includes the benefit of pricing taken in Venezuela to offset cost inflation. We experienced currency-neutral comparable net sales growth in Latin America, which was driven primarily by pricing taken in Venezuela. We also experienced currency-neutral comparable net sales growth in Asia-Pacific, U. S. Specialty and the Canadian business which is included in the North America Other reportable segment.\nReported operating profit increased by 6.6% primarily due to the favorable year-over-year change in the pension mark-to-market which was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation, the impact of remeasuring our Venezuela business using the SIMADI rate in the second quarter of 2015, and the impact of resetting incentive compensation levels. Currency-neutral comparable operating profit declined by 2.3%, at the high end of our expectations, due to the resetting of incentive compensation levels which impacted results by approximately 3%. The 1% growth excluding the effect of resetting incentive compensation levels was the result of sales growth and a 50 basis point reduction in brand-building investment as a percentage of net sales. Our brand building is down including shifts of investment into other areas such as food, the evolving shift in media investment from TV to digital, and efficiency and effectiveness benefits. Our zero-based budgeting initiative may identify additional efficiency and effectiveness opportunities in brand building as we proceed through 2016. We may choose to reinvest these savings back into brand building or other areas such as food reformulation or capacity to drive revenue growth. We remain committed to invest in our brands at an industry-leading level to maintain the strength of our many recognizable brands in the marketplace.\nReported diluted EPS of $1.72 was down 1.7% compared to the prior year of $1.75. Reported diluted EPS was impacted negatively by Project K costs ($.64), mark-to-market accounting ($.84), the remeasurement of the Venezuelan business using the SIMADI rate ($.42), foreign currency translation ($.28), and integration costs ($.06), and was impacted positively by a VIE deconsolidation ($.14) and acquisitions ($.01). Currency-neutral comparable diluted EPS of $3.81 was flat compared to prior year of $3.81, in line with our expectations.\nReconciliation of certain non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTable 41:

Foods\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 1.6% as a result of unfavorable volume and pricing/mix. This segment consists of cereal, toaster pastries, health and wellness bars, and beverages.\nWe saw a lot of improvement across the year in the Morning Foods business. We invested where we needed\nto and worked hard to improve the fundamentals by improving our brand building and the new products we\nlaunched. We also invested in our foods and put fun back in the box with Avengers\u00ae and Disney Frozen\u00ae-themed cereals.\nOur cereal business reported a decline for the full year, although we continued to reflect improving trends throughout the year, and we reported consumption growth and share gains in the fourth quarter as our business continues to improve ahead of category trends. Our six core cereals in combination (Special K\u00ae, Raisin Bran\u00ae, Frosted Flakes\u00ae, Mini-Wheats\u00ae, Froot Loops\u00ae, and Rice Krispies\u00ae) gained share and increased consumption for the year, with even stronger growth in both share and consumption in the fourth quarter. Special K\u00ae posted consumption growth and share gains for the year and even stronger results for the fourth quarter driven primarily by the renovation work we completed on Special K\u00ae Red Berries. The good growth we saw all year on Raisin Bran\u00ae was the result of great advertising and the introduction of Raisin Bran\u00ae with Cranberries.\nWe expect to continue driving sales in 2016 with the introduction of new products like Special K\u00ae Nourish, a cereal with positive nutrition and ingredients the consumer can see, and the food includes fruits, nuts and on-trend grains like quinoa. Initial response on this innovation has been encouraging. In addition, we're launching Mini-Wheats\u00ae Harvest Delights, Smorz\u00ae, and Disney Dory\u00ae-themed cereal.\nToaster pastries reported a slight sales decline for the year. Health and wellness bars and beverages each reported a sales decline.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit increased 2.1% due to improved gross margins resulting from lower input costs and Project K savings as well as lower brand-building investment. This was partially offset by the sales performance, increased distribution costs, and resetting of incentive compensation levels.\nU.S. Snacks\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 1.6% as a result of decreased volume which was partially offset by favorable pricing/mix. This segment consists of crackers, cereal bars, cookies, savory snacks, and fruit-flavored snacks.\nCrackers posted a sales decline as consumption declined across several of our products, while consumption increased for our Big 3 brands in combination (Cheez-It\u00ae , Town House\u00ae, and Club\u00ae). The consumption decline was due primarily to weakness in Special K\u00ae Cracker Chips during the first half of the year and full-year weakness in Special K\u00ae Popcorn Chips. The Special K\u00ae Cracker Chips products we restaged earlier this year posted consumption growth for the past two quarters as a result of improvements in packaging and food. We expect the impact of the remaining skus to lessen as we progress through 2016. The consumption increase for our Big 3 brands was primarily the result of strong consumption and share gains in Cheez-It\u00ae due to the Cheez-It\u00ae Grooves and Cheez-It\u00ae Extra Toasty innovations.\nThe bars business declined due to weakness in the Special K\u00ae and Fiber Plus\u00ae brands. The performance of our Special K bars has improved in the second half of the year as a result of new products and renovation that occurred early in the year and good results from Special K\u00ae Chewy Nut bars that were launched in mid-2015. Rice Krispies Treats\u00ae reported double-digit consumption gains and gained share as a result of good core growth and innovation.\nThe cookies business consumption declined for the year resulting in lost share, although we have seen improving trends over the second half of 2015 as a result of good performance in Chips Deluxe\u00ae, Fudge Shoppe\u00ae, and Famous Amos\u00ae due to expanded distribution, new products, and increased in-store activity. We have great brands in the category and we have some exciting new introductions planned for 2016. We are also going to give the brands new support in 2016, including the relaunch of advertising featuring the Keebler\u00ae Elves.\nSavory snacks reported low-single-digit growth as a result of consumption growth due to core products and innovations. The Pringles\u00ae business had a good year including strength in the on-the-go segment. As we enter the\nnew year we are adding new capacity and we have good plans; as a result, we look forward to a strong 2016.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined by 11.3% due to unfavorable sales performance and the resetting of incentive compensation levels.\nU.S. Specialty\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales increased 0.7% as a result of favorable pricing/mix which was partially offset by decreased volume. Sales growth was reported in the Convenience and Vending channels, partially offset by a slight decline in Foodservice partially due to the exit of some unprofitable business early in the year.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined by 0.8% due to the resetting of incentive compensation levels which more than offset the favorable sales performance.\nNorth America Other\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 3.2% due to decreased volume and unfavorable pricing/mix.\nThe U.S. Frozen business reported a net sales decline due to the impact from egg prices, network improvements, and a decision to draw down inventories due to changes in packaging from boxes to bags for our veggie foods business. The packaging conversion is going well, but we expect sales to continue to be impacted in the first quarter of 2016 and for performance to improve over the balance of the year. The Eggo\u00ae hand-held sandwiches posted double-digit consumption growth and share gains for the year.\nThe Canada business reported a broad-based net sales increase across several categories for the year. For 2016, the Canadian team is planning introductions of new products and improved support, much like the rest of the North American region.\nKashi reported a double-digit net sales decline although the business continues to experience stabilized distribution and sequential improvement across the last two quarters in part due to the impact of the introduction of new products in the second half of 2015. Bear Naked\u00ae Granola posted double-digit consumption growth for the year. We expect continued improvement in 2016 due to further improvement in distribution and the impact of a focus on new products high in protein from plants.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined 16.1% primarily due to unfavorable sales performance in the U.S. Frozen and Kashi businesses, net cost inflation including transactional currency expense in the Canadian business and increased material costs in the U.S. Frozen business, and the resetting of incentive compensation levels.\nEurope\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 0.6% as a result of relatively flat volume and unfavorable pricing/mix.\nThe Pringles\u00ae business posted strong, double-digit net sales growth as a result of good promotions, innovations and distribution gains throughout the year. Both the base business and the launch of Pringles\u00ae Tortilla in the UK and Germany contributed. We have some exciting activity planned for Pringles\u00ae in 2016 as well, including soccer-themed activity planned to coincide with the Euros soccer tournament in the summer and the continued roll-out of Pringles\u00ae Tortilla in the region.\nThe wholesome snacks business posted growth in the second half of the year. This was due to better results in the UK driven in part by Disney\u00ae-branded snacks, mini biscuits, Crunchy Nut\u00ae, and Rice Krispies Squares\u00ae. In addition, the Russian business did well. We also have new foods coming across the region in 2016.\nThe Cereal business in Europe declined due to challenges in the category in many of the countries. However, we improved our plans for Special K\u00ae and Crunchy Nut\u00ae in the UK, saw good performance from Extra\u00ae in Italy, and\ninvested behind Kellogg's\u00ae-branded granola in Germany. Also, we recently launched the Ancient Legends\u00ae brands in the region. These are great products, which include on-trend ingredients like spelt, apples, sultanas, and chia seeds. We are also applying learnings from our US cereal business including the renovation of Special K\u00ae Red Berries, the launch of Special K\u00ae Nourish, and we're also adding more fun in the box.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit improved 4.3% due to net cost deflation and strong savings, including savings from Project K.\nLatin America\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales improved 24.6% due to favorable volume and pricing/mix, including the impact of pricing actions in Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, currency-neutral comparable net sales would have grown 1.3%.\nWe experienced volume growth in several of our markets, including Mexico. We also realized strong price realization in Venezuela as a result of pricing actions taken to offset cost inflation. Cereal sales in the region increased and we have held or gained share in most of the region. These share gains have been driven by children's and family brands and the introduction of Kellogg-branded granolas and muesli products.\nSales in the snacks business also increased driven by innovation and go-to-market activity. The Pringles\u00ae business continued to perform well and we have launched Pringles\u00ae Tortilla in the region.\nOur focus on high-frequency stores continues to drive results. We've seen results in Convenience and mini-Super stores in Mexico, and in smaller stores in Colombia. We have also had success driving sales growth through packaging initiatives designed to drive affordability and accessibility in various areas of the business.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit improved by 15.4% due to favorable price realization which was partially offset by net cost inflation. Excluding Venezuela, currency neutral comparable operating profit declined 3.4% as sales growth and margin expansion were more than offset by increased investment in brand-building and business capabilities.\nAsia Pacific\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales increased 4.0% as a result of increased volume which was partially offset by unfavorable pricing/mix. Unfavorable pricing/mix was primarily the result of country mix.\nThe sales increase was the result of double-digit growth in the Asian markets, double-digit growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, and mid-single-digit growth in the savory snacks business across the region. The growth in Asia included double-digit sales growth in Japan driven by the continued growth of the granola category and the impact of new packaging as well as double-digit growth in Korea and Southeast Asia. The savory snacks business reported broad-based sales growth and share gains due to innovation and gains in distribution.\nThis sales performance was partially offset by weakness in the Australian cereal category. However, the granola and m\u00fcesli segments are growing well and we have a plan to address the weakness in the overall Australian business in 2016. We are also applying lessons learned in our US business to our Australia business.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined 3.7% as our investment of Project K savings into emerging markets in the region behind brand investments and capabilities more than offset the favorable sales performance.\nCorporate\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined due to the resetting of incentive compensation levels which was partially offset by reduced pension costs.\n2014 compared to 2013\nThe following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for

net sales declined 4.8% as a result of unfavorable volume and pricing/mix. This segment consists of cereal, toaster pastries, health and wellness bars, and beverages.\nThe cereal category continued to decline through the year despite our continued investments behind category-building programs that started early in the year. Much of our decline in the cereal category has come from Special K\u00ae. We experienced weakness in Special K\u00ae as it faced headwinds from evolving consumer trends regarding weight management. As a result, we changed the positioning of the brand from a focus on dieting to weight wellness. This focus will stress the role that Special K\u00ae plays in a healthy lifestyle. We have begun the execution of this new positioning for the overall cereal business through the following initiatives:\n \u2022 We have launched the See You at Breakfast campaign and the Open for Breakfast digital program designed to help us connect directly with consumers \n \u2022 We are revitalizing the Special K\u00ae brand and are launching new products such as Special K\u00ae Gluten-free and Special K\u00ae Protein \nWe expect that these actions will have a positive impact on the performance of the Special K\u00ae, and on the cereal business as a whole. Our plan for investment is long-term and the levels, content, and effectiveness of the support will evolve, and increase over time.\nToaster pastries reported a sales decline for the year as a result of difficult comparisons due to the peanut butter innovations launched in 2013. However we did gain share for the year and introduced a new PB&J innovation in November and we expect this to improve sales results. Health and wellness bars and beverages each reported a sales decline for the year.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined 10.0% due to the unfavorable sales performance and a mid-single-digit increase in cereal brand-building investment. This was partially offset by a decrease in brand-building investment behind health and wellness bars and beverages, and continued cost discipline.\nU.S. Snacks\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 2.8% as a result of decreased volume partially offset by favorable pricing/mix. This segment consists of crackers, cereal bars, cookies, savory snacks, and fruit-flavored snacks.\nCrackers posted a slight sales increase and gained share as a result of the continued success of Cheez-It\u00ae innovations and core products in the Town House\u00ae, and Club\u00ae brands due to brand-building support and sales execution. Cheez-It\u00ae, Town House\u00ae, and Club\u00ae all reported solid consumption and share gains. The gains in these three brands have been offset by weakness in Special K\u00ae Cracker Chips due to similar consumer trends that we have experienced in the cereal category. We have addressed this weakness by launching completely restaged Cracker Chips with new flavors, better flavor and texture profiles, improved packaging, and new positioning. This new product started to arrive in stores in late 2014.\nThe bars business declined due to weakness in the Special K\u00ae and Fiber Plus\u00ae brands. The issues with these brands are similar to what we have experienced in the cereal category. To address these issues we launched new products and activities in the fourth quarter of this year and will launch more new, great-tasting Special K\u00ae snack bars with new packaging and new positioning. This activity ties into the initiatives we are launching in other categories and regions around the world. This new product started to arrive in stores in late December. Rice Krispies Treats\u00ae and Nutri-grain\u00ae both reported consumption gains and gained share as a result of good core growth and innovation.\nThe cookies business declined resulting in lost share. However we saw share gains from Chips Deluxe\u00ae as a result of new co-branded products. We experienced soft performance in our 100-calorie packs business throughout the year. We are migrating consumers to an expanded line of single-serve products, which should help to reduce the impact of the decline. We also experienced the negative impact of a SKU rationalization initiative.\nSavory snacks reported mid-single-digit sales growth and held share for the year behind the performance of the core business, Grab \u2018n Go, and the new Pringles\u00ae Tortilla product.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined by 10.9% due to unfavorable sales performance and net cost inflation. This was partially offset by continued cost discipline.\nU.S. Specialty\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 1.2% as a result of decreased volume and unfavorable pricing/mix. Sales declines were the result of the negative impact of weather early in the year, supply issues with a co-packer, and an inventory de-load as a customer shifted from warehouse to direct delivery.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined by 1.5% due to the unfavorable sales performance. This was partially offset by cost discipline.\nNorth America Other\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 3.2% due to decreased volume and unfavorable pricing/mix.\nThe U.S. Frozen business reported a decline due to unfavorable comparisons early in the year resulting from strong prior-year growth behind innovation activity and costs later in the year associated with the launch of new products. New Eggo\u00ae Bites and Eggo\u00ae handheld sandwiches performed well during the year. The combination of the Eggo\u00ae handheld sandwiches and good results from our Special K\u00ae handheld sandwiches resulted in a double-digit sales increase for our sandwich business during our final quarter of the year. Consumption of Eggo\u00ae waffles is improving as we have re-launched the L'Eggo My Eggo\u00ae brand-building program and launched Eggo\u00ae gluten-free and a new variety of Thick-n-Fluffy waffles.\nCanada reported a slight increase in sales driven primarily by the snacks business as volumes increased at a low single-digit rate.\nKashi reported a decline in sales as we continued to experience softness in the cereal category. We have identified areas of focus for Kashi\u00ae which is a great brand in a category that is on trend. We have begun the execution of this new positioning through the following initiatives:\n \u2022 All Kashi Go-Lean\u00ae products will be Non GMO Project Verified \n \u2022 All Kashi Heart-to-Heart\u00ae products will meet the USDA's Organic standard \nWe expect that these initiatives will have a positive impact on the performance of Kashi\u00ae.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined 3.8% primarily due to unfavorable sales performance. This was partially offset by continued cost discipline.\nEurope\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 0.8% as a result of flat volume and unfavorable pricing/mix. Cereal category consumption remains soft in most developed markets, similar to the cereal category in the U.S. Emerging markets reported good growth for the year in both cereal and snacks. To address the cereal category softness, we executed brand-building activities in the second half of the year. New Special K\u00ae advertising has recently gone on air which addresses the recent health and wellness trends that have negatively impacted this brand.\nSavory snacks performed well throughout the year, with the final quarter of 2014 reporting the highest sales since we acquired the business. New products are launching, including Pringles\u00ae Tortilla, and we have more capacity coming on-line mid-year.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit improved 7.4% due to net cost deflation, including strong productivity savings, and decreased brand-building investment. This was partially offset by unfavorable sales performance.\nLatin America\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales improved 3.9% due to favorable pricing/mix which was partially offset by decreased volume. Strong price realization, primarily from Venezuela, has more than offset sales declines early in the year resulting from the volume elasticity impact of the introduction of a new food tax in Mexico. We reported growth in Venezuela, Mercosur, and the Pringles business as well as pricing gains in a majority of our markets. The\ncereal business posted good results, although we saw some competitive price promotions in Mexico which affected selected segments. The momentum of the savory snacks business continues, driven by strong commercial programs, innovation, and good execution.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit improved by 9.0% due to favorable sales performance which was partially offset by net cost inflation, increased brand-building investment to support innovation and new programs, and increased overhead investment.\nAsia Pacific\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales increased 0.8% as a result of flat volume and favorable pricing/mix. The sales increase was the result of double-digit growth in the Asian markets and high-single-digit growth in the savory snacks business across the region. This sales performance was partially offset by weakness in the Australian cereal category and our performance in South Africa as we conducted construction work early in the year and it took longer than expected to bring the plant back on line.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined 7.3% due to the weakness in the Australian cereal category and our performance in South Africa. This was partially offset by cost discipline.\nCorporate\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit improved as a result of reduced pension costs which was partially offset by increased overhead investments.\nMargin performance\n2015 versus 2014 margin performance was as follows:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

comparability section.\n (a) Reported gross margin as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin is equal to net sales less cost of goods sold. \nCurrency-neutral comparable gross margin declined by 10 basis points in 2015 due to the impact of Venezuela. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, currency-neutral comparable gross margin would have increased by 20 basis points as a result of productivity savings, Project K savings, and deflation in commodities and packaging which was partially offset by higher distribution costs and investment in our foods such as the launch of granolas and mueslis across the globe and the renovation of existing foods such as Special K\u00ae.\nCurrency-neutral comparable SG&A% was worse by 40 basis points as a result of resetting incentive compensation, reinvestment of Project K savings into sales capabilities including adding sales representatives, and re-establishing the Kashi business unit which was partially offset by improvements resulting from efficiency and effectiveness programs as well as decreased brand

on restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our long-term profit growth targets. Initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a five-year period of completion. Upon completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi-year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation.\nProject K\nProject K, a four-year efficiency and effectiveness program, was announced in November 2013, and is expected to generate a significant amount of savings that may be invested in key strategic areas of focus for the business. We expect that this investment will drive future growth in revenues, gross margin, operating profit, and cash flow.\nThe focus of the program will be to strengthen existing businesses in core markets, increase growth in developing and emerging markets, and drive an increased level of value-added innovation. The program is expected to provide a number of benefits, including an optimized supply chain infrastructure, the implementation of global business services, and a new global focus on categories.\nWe currently anticipate that Project K will result in total pre-tax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, of $1.2 to $1.4 billion, with after-tax cash costs, including incremental capital investments, estimated to be $900 million to $1.1 billion. Cash expenditures of approximately $625 million have been incurred through the end of fiscal year 2015. Total cash expenditures, as defined, are expected to be approximately $150 million for 2016 and the balance of $125 to $325 million thereafter. Total charges for Project K in 2016 are expected to be approximately $175 to $200 million.\nWe expect annual cost savings generated from Project K will be approximately $425 to $475 million by 2018, with approximately two-thirds of the cost savings to be realized in cost of goods sold. We have realized approximately $180 million of annual savings through the end of 2015. We expect approximately $100 million of incremental savings in 2016, approximately 75 to 80 percent of which will come from cost of goods sold. Cost savings will be utilized to increase margins and drive sales growth through additional investments in advertising, in-store execution, sales capabilities, including adding sales representatives, re-establishing the Kashi business unit, and in the design and quality of our products. We will also invest in production capacity in developing and emerging markets, and in global category teams.\nAs a result of Project K, capital spending levels were increased to 4% of net sales during both 2014 and 2015. Our on-going business model assumes capital spending to be approximately 3-4% of net sales annually.\nThus far, we have funded much of the cash requirements for Project K through our supplier financing initiative. Due to the difference in timing between expected cash costs for the project and expected future cash savings, we anticipate funding the project through a combination of cash on hand and short-term debt.\nWe also expect that the project will have an impact on our consolidated effective income tax rate during the execution of the project due to the timing of charges being taken in different tax jurisdictions. The impact of this project on our consolidated effective income tax rate will be excluded from the comparable income tax rate that will be disclosed on a quarterly basis.\nRefer to Note 4 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to Project K and other restructuring activities.\nOther Projects\nIn 2015 we initiated the implementation of a zero-based budgeting (ZBB) program in our North America business. This ZBB program is expected to deliver visibility to $100 million in annual savings in North America during 2016. We will begin to expand ZBB into our international businesses during 2016 with modest savings expected in certain locations in 2016. We expect increased savings to be realized in our international businesses in 2017 and beyond.\nIn support of the ZBB initiative, we incurred pre-tax charges of approximately $12 million in 2015. We anticipate that ZBB will result in cumulative pre-tax charges of approximately $25 to $50 million through 2016 which will consist primarily of the design and implementation of business capabilities.\nForeign currency translation\nThe reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in the euro, British pound, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Venezuelan bolivar fuerte, and Russian ruble. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates. As a result, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. This could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar is substantial.\nInterest expense\nAnnual interest expense is illustrated in the following table. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to a higher average level of long-term debt and to higher interest rates, partially resulting from lower levels of debt swapped to a variable rate. The decline in 2014 was primarily due to refinancing of maturing long-term debt at lower interest rates and lower interest rates on long-term debt which has effectively been converted to floating rate obligations through the use of interest rate swaps. Interest income (recorded in other income (expense), net) was (in millions), 2015-$4; 2014-$8; 2013-$7. We currently expect that our 2016 gross interest expense will be approximately $235 to $245 million.\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change vs.\nprior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reported interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts capitalized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.7)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome taxes\nOur reported effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 20.6%, 22.6% and 30.4% respectively. Comparable effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 25.6%, 28.2%, and 28.4%, respectively.\nThe 2015 and 2014 effective income tax rates benefited from the mark-to-market loss recorded for our pension plans. Refer to Note 12 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon U.S. dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates. Additionally, the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters, including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives, are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of as reported to currency-neutral comparable income taxes and effective income tax rate for 2015 and 2014.\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td>

impacting comparability section.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions. Our cash-generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs.\nWe have historically reported negative working capital primarily as the result of our focus to improve core working capital by reducing our levels of trade receivables and inventory while extending the timing of payment of our trade payables. In addition, we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which results in current maturities of long-term debt and notes payable which can have a significant impact on working capital as a result of the timing of these required payments. These factors, coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, pay dividends, fund acquisition opportunities, and repurchase our common stock, reduce our working capital amounts. We had negative working capital of $2.5 billion and $1.0 billion as of January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, respectively.\nWe believe that our operating cash flows, together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that volatility and/or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nAs of January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, we had $231 million and $257 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents held in international jurisdictions which will be used to fund capital and other cash requirements of international operations. These amounts include $2 million and $68 million at January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, respectively, subject to currency exchange controls in Venezuela, limiting the total amount of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries that can be repatriated at any particular point in time.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,127\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(641\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(706\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,063\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,141\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(192\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities\nThe principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings, meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products, net of costs to manufacture and market our products.\nOur net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 amounted to $1,691 million, a decrease of $102 million compared with 2014. The decrease compared to the prior year is the result of the negative year over year impact of accounts receivable mitigated somewhat by the incremental cash flow benefit from the supplier financing initiative of approximately $210 million. Our net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 amounted to $1,793 million, a decrease of $14 million compared with 2013, due primarily to the negative incremental impact of Project K cash requirements mitigated somewhat by the positive impact from the supplier financing initiative of approximately $210 million.\nAfter-tax cash payments related to Project K were $192 million in 2015, $187 million in 2014, and $18 million in 2013.\nOur cash conversion cycle (defined as days of inventory, excluding inventoriable mark-to-market pension costs, and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding, based on a trailing 12 month average) is relatively short, equating to approximately 14 days and 27 days for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Core working capital in 2015 averaged 6.2% of net sales, compared to 7.6% in 2014 and 7.8% in 2013. In 2015, both our cash conversion cycle and core working capital showed improvements in days of trade payables outstanding which includes the positive impact of a supplier financing initiative. Days of trade receivables and inventory on hand increased slightly from 2014 to 2015.\nOur total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to $33 million, $53 million and $48 million, in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe Pension Protection Act (PPA), and subsequent regulations, determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the United States. We believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under PPA requirements until 2021 or beyond. Our projections concerning timing of PPA funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance, future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the PPA.\nWe currently project that we will make total U.S. and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2016 of approximately $43 million. Actual 2016 contributions could be different from our current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities, future changes in government requirements, trust asset performance, renewals of union contracts, or higher-than-expected health care claims cost experience.\nWe measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. We use this non-GAAP financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases. Our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure, as follows:\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additions to properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(553\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(582\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(637\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>year-over-year change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in cash flow (as defined) in 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to the unfavorable year over year impact of accounts receivable mitigated somewhat by the favorable year over year impact of trade payables as a result of the supplier financing initiative. The increase in cash flow in 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to lower capital expenditures and improved core working capital partially offset by the negative impact of Project K cash requirements.\nInvesting activities\nOur net cash used in investing activities for 2015 amounted to $1,127 million, an increase of $554 million compared with 2014. In 2015, we acquired, for $445 million, a 50% interest in Multipro Singapore Pte. Ltd., a leading distributor of a variety of food products in Nigeria and Ghana, and an option to purchase a minority interest in an affiliated food manufacturer. In addition to our joint venture investment in 2015, we also acquired Mass Foods and a majority interest in Bisco Misr.\nCapital spending in 2015 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure, and to support capacity requirements in certain markets and products, including Pringles in Asia-Pacific.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $573 million in 2014 decreased $68 million compared with 2013.\nCash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales increased to 4.1% in 2015, from 4.0% in 2014, which was a decrease from 4.3% in 2013.\nFinancing activities\nOur net cash used by financing activities was $706 million, $1,063 million and $1,141 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The use of cash in financing activities compared to the prior year declined due primarily to net proceeds from notes payable of $374 million in 2015 versus $89 million in 2014.\nTotal debt was $7.8 billion and $7.4 billion at year-end 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn May 2015, we repaid our $350 million 1.125% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2015 at maturity.\nIn February 2015, we repaid our floating-rate $250 million U.S. Dollar Notes due 2015 at maturity and in March 2015, we issued \u20ac600 million of ten-year 1.25% Euro Notes due 2025.\nIn March 2014, we redeemed $150 million of our 4.00% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2020, $342 million of our 3.125% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2022 and $189 million of our 2.75% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2023. In connection with the debt redemption, we incurred $1 million of interest expense, offset by $8 million of accelerated gains on interest rate hedges previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, and incurred $5 million expense, recorded in Other Income, Expense (net), related to acceleration of fees on the redeemed debt and fees related to the tender offer.\nIn May 2014, we issued \u20ac500 million of seven-year 1.75% Euro Notes due 2021, using the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which included repayment of a portion of our commercial paper borrowings.\nIn May 2014, we issued Cdn. $300 million of three-year 2.05% Canadian Dollar Notes due 2017, using the proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay our Cdn. $300 million, 2.10% Notes due May 2014 at maturity.\nIn February 2013, we issued $250 million of two-year floating-rate U.S. Dollar Notes, and $400 million of ten-year 2.75% U.S. Dollar Notes, resulting in aggregate net proceeds after debt discount of $645 million. The proceeds from these Notes were used for general corporate purposes, including, together with cash on hand, repayment of the $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% U.S. Dollar Notes due March 2013.\nIn April 2013, the board of directors approved a $1 billion share repurchase program expiring in April 2014. In February 2014, the board of directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion in shares through December 2015. In December 2015, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to $1.5 billion beginning in 2016 through December 2017.\nDuring 2015, we purchased 11 million shares totaling $731 million. During 2014, we purchased 11 million shares totaling $690 million. In May 2013, we entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) Agreement with a financial institution counterparty and paid $355 million for the purchase of shares during the term of the agreement which extended through August 2013. The total number of shares delivered upon settlement of the ASR was based upon the volume weighted average price of the Company's stock over the term of the agreement. Total shares\npurchased in 2013, including shares delivered under the ASR, amounted to approximately 9 million shares totaling $544 million.\nWe paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling $1.98 per share in 2015, $1.90 per share in 2014 and $1.80 per share in 2013. Total cash paid for dividends increased by 3.0% in 2015 and 4.0% in 2014. In February 2016, the board of directors declared a dividend of $.50 per common share, payable on March 15, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2016.\nIn February 2014, we entered into an unsecured Five-Year Credit Agreement to replace the existing unsecured Four-Year Credit Agreement, which would have expired in March 2015. The Five-Year Credit Agreement allows us to borrow, on a revolving credit basis, up to $2.0 billion.\nOur long-term debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit Kellogg Company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and lease-back transactions. Some agreements also contain change in control provisions. However, they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings. A change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the U.S. short-term debt market and/or increase the cost of refinancing long-term debt in the future. However, even under these circumstances, we would continue to have access to our Five-Year Credit Agreement, which expires in February 2019. This source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis, although we do not currently plan to use it.\nWe monitor the financial strength of our third-party financial institutions, including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities, our derivative financial instruments, and other arrangements.\nWe are in compliance with all covenants as of January 2, 2016. We continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future, while still meeting our operational needs, including the pursuit of selected bolt-on acquisitions. This will be accomplished through our strong cash flow, our short-term borrowings, and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis. We anticipate establishing a discrete customer program which would allow for extended customer payment terms. In connection with this program, we may enter into an agreement with one or more financial institutions to monetize these receivables resulting in the receivables being de-recognized from our consolidated balance sheet. We currently estimate that the amount of these receivables held at any time by the financial institution(s) will be approximately $500 to $600 million.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nAs of January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015 we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at January 2, 2016:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 and\nbeyond\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>942\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uncertain tax positions (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term obligations (f)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Includes interest payments on our long-term debt and payments on our interest rate swaps. Interest calculated on our variable rate debt was forecasted using the LIBOR forward rate curve as of January 2, 2016. \n (b) The total expected cash payments on our capital leases include interest expense totaling less than $1 million over the periods presented above. \n (c) Operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. \n (d) Purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business and for marketing, advertising and other services. The amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or other current liabilities at year-end 2015, nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans, but are not obligated to incur. Therefore, it should be noted that the exclusion of these items from the table could be a limitation in assessing our total future cash flows under contracts. \n (e) As of January 2, 2016, our total liability for uncertain tax positions was $73 million, of which $13 million is expected to be paid in the next twelve months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining $60 million. \n (f) Other long-term obligations are those associated with noncurrent liabilities recorded within the Consolidated Balance Sheet at year-end 2015 and consist principally of projected commitments under deferred compensation arrangements, multiemployer plans, and supplemental employee retirement benefits. The table also includes our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans through 2021 as follows: 2016-$43; 2017-$34; 2018-$34; 2019-$34; 2020-$103; 2021-$190. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nPromotional expenditures\nOur promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in-store displays and events, feature price discounts, consumer coupons, contests and loyalty programs. The costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer. These estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. Differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. On a full-year basis, these subsequent period adjustments represent approximately 0.4% of our company's net sales. However, our company's total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a revenue reduction) are significant, so it is likely our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.\nProperty\nLong-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Management evaluates several conditions, including, but not limited to, the following: a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, including an extended period of idleness; and a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. For assets to be held and used, we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the long-lived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset. If the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data. There are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses.\nAt January 2, 2016, we have property, plant and equipment of $3.6 billion, net of accumulated depreciation, on our balance sheet. Included in this amount are approximately $51 million of idle assets.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\nWe perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process.\nGoodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. For the 2015 goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples. Our approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units. In the event the fair value determined using the market multiples approach is close to the carrying value, we may also supplement our fair value determination using discounted cash flows. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units.\nSimilarly, impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset. Fair values of non-goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset. For instance, cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants. These estimates are made using various inputs including historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market comparables.\nWe also evaluate the useful life over which a non-goodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.\nAt January 2, 2016, goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to $7.2 billion, consisting primarily of goodwill and brands associated with the 2001 acquisition of Keebler Foods Company and the 2012 acquisition of Pringles. Within this total, approximately $2.2 billion of non-goodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinite-lived, comprised principally of Keebler and Pringles trademarks. We currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows. The percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the U.S. Snacks reporting unit was approximately 43% and 59% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. However, if we had used materially different assumptions, which we do not believe are reasonably possible, regarding the future performance of our business or a different market multiple in the valuation, this could have resulted in significant impairment losses. Additionally, we have $25 million of goodwill related to our 2008 acquisition of United Bakers in Russia. Fair value of the intangibles for this business exceeded carrying value in 2015. If we used modestly different assumptions regarding sales multiples and EBITDA in the valuation, this could have resulted in an impairment loss. Management will continue to monitor the situation closely.\nRetirement benefits\nOur company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the United States and Canada. Plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance. A substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments. We recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees' active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans. Inherent in this concept is the requirement to\nuse various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date. Major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the health care cost trend rates, the mortality table and improvement scale, and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans, which cover employees in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.\nOur expense recognition policy for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits is to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually as of our measurement date, which is our fiscal year-end, or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles.\nAdditionally, for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits we use the fair value of plan assets.\nTo conduct our annual review of the long-term rate of return on plan assets, we model expected returns over a 20-year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans. The return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long-term bonds, price-earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and long-term inflation. Our U.S. plan model, corresponding to approximately 68% of our trust assets globally, currently incorporates a long-term inflation assumption of 2.5% and an active management premium of 1% (net of fees) validated by historical analysis and future return expectations. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return annually, our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our expected rates of return have generally not been revised, provided these rates continue to fall within a more likely than not\u201d corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected long-term returns, as determined by our modeling process. Our assumed rate of return for U.S. plans in 2016 of 8.5% equates to approximately the 57th percentile expectation of our model. Similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets, reflecting local economic conditions. Foreign trust investments represent approximately 32% of our global benefit plan assets.\nBased on consolidated benefit plan assets at January 2, 2016, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would correspondingly increase or decrease 2016 benefits expense by approximately\n$55 million. For each of the three fiscal years, our actual return on plan assets exceeded (was less than) the recognized assumed return by the following amounts (in millions): 2015-$(666); 2014-$(41); 2013-$545.\nTo conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates, we model our actual claims cost data over a five-year historical period, including an analysis of pre-65 versus post-65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population. This data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends. Our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short-term future trends. In comparison to our actual five-year compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 4.95%, our initial trend rate for 2016 of 5.00% reflects the expected future impact of faster-growing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population. Our initial rate is trended downward by 0.25% per year, until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5% is reached. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Based on consolidated obligations at January 2, 2016, a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2016 benefits expense by approximately $4 million and generate an immediate loss recognition of $89 million. A 100 basis point excess of 2016 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an experience loss of approximately $4 million and would increase 2016 expense by $0.2 million. Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur. The experience loss arising from recognition of 2015 claims experience was approximately $3 million.\nAssumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize. At the end of 2014, we revised our mortality assumption after considering the Society of Actuaries' (SOA) updated mortality tables and improvement scale, as well as other mortality information available from the Social Security Administration to develop assumptions aligned with our expectation of future improvement rates. In determining the appropriate mortality assumptions as of January 2, 2016, we considered the SOA's 2015 updated improvement scale and believe our assumption remains appropriate.\nTo conduct our annual review of discount rates, we selected the discount rate based on a cash-flow matching analysis using Willis Towers Watson's proprietary RATE:Link tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans. RATE:Link establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments, as is generated by discounting each year's benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. The spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of U.S. high quality bonds. A similar methodology is applied in Canada and Europe, except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable. We use a December 31 measurement date for our defined benefit plans. Accordingly, we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during December of each year.\nBased on consolidated obligations at January 2, 2016, a 25 basis point decline in the weighted-average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would decrease 2016 benefits expense by approximately $2 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of $222 million. All obligation-related actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur.\nDespite the previously-described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions, we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience. During 2015, we recognized a net actuarial loss of approximately $418 million compared to a net actuarial loss of approximately $918 million in 2014. Of the total net loss recognized in 2015, approximately $(245) million was related primarily to favorable changes in the discount rate and other assumptions and $666 million was related to asset losses and $(3) million was related to a discrete benefit resulting from certain events affecting our benefit programs. Of the $918 million net loss recognized in 2014, approximately $911 million was related to unfavorable changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions, and $41 million was related to asset losses, and $(34) million was related to a discrete benefit resulting from certain events affecting our benefit programs.\nDuring 2015, we made contributions in the amount of $19 million to Kellogg's global tax-qualified pension programs. This amount was mostly non-discretionary. Additionally we contributed $14 million to our retiree medical programs.\nIncome taxes\nOur consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment. Income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is expected to be remitted to and taxable in the United States.\nWe recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, new or emerging legislation and tax planning. The tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. Significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of Note 12 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED IN FUTURE PERIODS\nRecognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption can be elected for all financial statements of fiscal years and interim periods that have not yet been issued or that have not yet been made available for issuance. Entities should apply the update by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2018. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nBalance sheet classification of deferred taxes. In November 2015, the FASB issued an ASU to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The ASU requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Entities should apply the new guidance either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating when we will adopt the updated standard and whether to use the prospective or retrospective method. Our year-end 2015 balance for current deferred tax assets and liabilities was $227 and $9 million, respectively. Please see Note 12 for more information on our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nSimplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments. In September 2015, the FASB issued an ASU to simplify the accounting for measurement-period adjustments for items in a business combination. The ASU requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Entities should apply the new guidance prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the ASU with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. We will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nSimplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. In April 2015, the FASB issued an ASU to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. The ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Entities should apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis. We will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nCustomer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. In April 2015, the FASB issued an ASU to help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Entities should apply the new guidance either; 1) prospectively to all arrangements entered into or\nmaterially modified after the effective date or 2) retrospectively. We will adopt the updated standard prospectively in the first quarter of 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nRevenue from contracts with customers. In May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU which provides guidance for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of this ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity would be required to apply the following five steps: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. When the ASU was originally issued it was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption was not permitted. On July 9, 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. The updated standard will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Entities will be permitted to adopt the new revenue standard early, but not before the original effective date. Entities will have the option to apply the final standard retrospectively or use a modified retrospective method, recognizing the cumulative effect of the ASU in retained earnings at the date of initial application. An entity will not restate prior periods if it uses the modified retrospective method, but will be required to disclose the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period by the application of the ASU as compared to the guidance in effect prior to the change, as well as reasons for significant changes. We will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact that implementing this ASU will have on our financial statements and disclosures, as well as whether we will use the retrospective or modified retrospective method of adoption.\nFUTURE OUTLOOK\nWe expect during 2016 that Project K and zero-based budgeting savings will enable us to continue to invest in our businesses, our foods, and the categories in which we compete. We expect currency-neutral comparable net sales growth to be in the range of 1 to 3 percent. While our original 2016 guidance always included pricing to cover the impact of inflation in Venezuela, our latest outlook includes more pricing to offset inflation. While it is difficult to predict pricing actions that will be required in Venezuela, it is possible that currency-neutral comparable net sales growth could exceed our guidance range due to Venezuela.\nWe also expect currency-neutral comparable gross margin to be up slightly due to deflation resulting from material costs, savings from Project K and zero-based budgeting. This expectation for currency-neutral comparable gross margin excludes the impact of highly inflationary economies. Finally, we expect currency-neutral comparable operating profit growth in the range of 4 to 6 percent and currency-neutral comparable EPS to increase in the range of 6 to 8 percent.\nWe expect that full-year operating cash flow will be approximately $1.1 billion, including capital spending in the range of 4 to 5 percent of net sales. This capital spending expectation reflects much lower capital spending for Project K, but increased capital spending to support growth in our Pringles business.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nKellogg Company and Subsidiaries\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBusiness overview\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand Kellogg Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report.\nFor more than 100 years, consumers have counted on Kellogg for great-tasting, high-quality and nutritious foods. Kellogg is the world's leading producer of cereal, second largest producer of cookies and crackers, and a leading producer of savory snacks and frozen foods. Additional product offerings include toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit-flavored snacks and veggie foods. Kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally.\nSegments and growth targets\nDuring Q1 2015, we established a new Kashi operating segment in order to optimize future growth potential of this business. This operating segment is included in the North America Other reportable segment. Including this new operating segment, we manage our operations through nine operating segments that are based on product category or geographic location. These operating segments are evaluated for similarity with regards to economic characteristics, products, production processes, types or classes of customers, distribution methods and regulatory environments to determine if they can be aggregated into reportable segments. We report results of operations in the following reportable segments: U.S. Morning Foods; U.S. Snacks; U.S. Specialty; North America Other; Europe; Latin America; and Asia Pacific. The reportable segments are discussed in greater detail in Note 17 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe manage our Company for sustainable performance defined by our long-term annual growth targets. Our targeted long-term annual growth is low-single-digit (1 to 3%) for currency-neutral comparable net sales, mid-single-digit (4 to 6%) for currency-neutral comparable operating profit, and high-single-digit (7 to 9%) for currency-neutral comparable diluted net earnings per share (EPS).\nSignificant items impacting comparability\nProject K and cost reduction activities\nDuring 2013, we announced Project K, a four-year efficiency and effectiveness program. The program is expected to generate a significant amount of savings that may be invested in key strategic areas of focus for the business. We expect that this investment will drive future growth in revenues, gross margin, operating profit, and cash flow. We recorded pre-tax charges related primarily to Project K of $311 million in 2015, $298 million in 2014, and $250 million in 2013.\nIn 2015 we initiated the implementation of a zero-based budgeting (ZBB) program in our North America business. In support of the ZBB initiative, we incurred pre-tax charges of approximately $12 million in 2015.\nSee the Restructuring and cost reduction activities section for more information.\nAcquisitions and dispositions\nIn September 2015, we completed the acquisition of Mass Foods, Egypt's leading cereal company for $46 million, or $44 million net of cash and cash equivalents acquired. The acquisition added $4 million in incremental net sales to our reported results in the European reportable segment for 2015. The acquisition added less than $1 million of incremental operating profit (before transaction and integration costs) to our reported results for 2015.\nIn January 2015, we completed the acquisition of a majority interest in Bisco Misr, the number one packaged biscuits company in Egypt for $125 million, or $117 million net of cash and cash equivalents acquired. The acquisition added $54 million in incremental net sales to our reported results in the European reportable segment for 2015. The acquisition added $4 million of incremental operating profit (before transaction and integration costs) to our reported results for 2015.\nDuring the quarter ended September 27, 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell our vegan and vegetarian canned-meat substitute business unit under the Loma Linda brand to Atlantic Natural Foods (ANF), LLC of Nashville, N.C. The disposition negatively impacted reported net sales in the U.S. Specialty reportable segment by approximately $9 million in 2015.\nIntegration and transaction costs\nWe have incurred integration and transaction costs related to the 2015 acquisitions of Bisco Misr and Mass Foods, the 2015 entry into a joint venture with Tolaram Africa, and the 2012 acquisition of Pringles as we move these businesses into the Kellogg business model. We recorded pre-tax integration and transaction costs of $30 million in 2015. We also recorded pre-tax integration costs of $43 million and $65 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nMark-to-market accounting for pension plans, commodities and certain foreign currency contracts\nWe recognize mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans, commodity contracts, and certain foreign currency contracts as incurred. Actuarial gains/losses for pension plans are recognized in the year they occur. Changes between contract and market prices for commodities contracts and certain foreign currency contracts result in gains/losses that are recognized in the quarter they occur. We recorded pre-tax mark-to-market charges of $446 million, $784 million, and a benefit of $947 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.\nOther costs impacting comparability\nIn 2015, a series of previously executed agreements between Kellogg's and a third party variable interest entity (VIE) were terminated resulting in our determination that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, we deconsolidated the financial statements of the VIE. As a result of the agreement terminations and related settlements, we recognized a loss of $19 million in Other income (expense), net.\nIn connection with the deconsolidation, we derecognized all assets and liabilities of the VIE, including an allocation of a portion of goodwill from the U.S. Snacks operating segment, resulting in a $67 million non-cash gain, which was recorded within operating profit.\nDuring 2014 we incurred $6 million of costs related to the evaluation of potential acquisitions.\nVenezuela remeasurement and long-lived asset impairment\nWhile we continue to qualify for participation in CENCOEX at the official rate, there has been a continued reduction in the level of U.S. dollars available to exchange, in part due to recent declines in the price of oil and the overall decline of the macroeconomic environment within the country. We have experienced an increase in the amount of time it takes to exchange bolivars for U.S. dollars through the CENCOEX exchange during the year. Given this economic backdrop, and upon review of U.S. dollar cash needs in our Venezuela operations as of the quarter ended July 4, 2015, we concluded that we were no longer able to obtain sufficient U.S. dollars on a timely basis through the CENCOEX exchange to support our Venezuela operations resulting in a decision to remeasure our Venezuela subsidiary's financial statements using the SIMADI rate. We have evaluated all of the facts and circumstances surrounding our Venezuelan business and determined that as of January 2, 2016 the SIMADI rate continues to be the appropriate rate to use for remeasuring our Venezuelan subsidiary's financial statements.\nIn connection with the change from the CENCOEX rate to the SIMADI rate that occurred in the quarter ended July 4, 2015, we evaluated the carrying value of our non-monetary assets for impairment and lower of cost or market adjustments. As a result of moving from the CENCOEX official rate to the SIMADI rate, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $152 million, including $112 million in the Latin America operating segment and $40 million in the Corporate operating segment. Of the total charges, $100 million was recorded in COGS, $3 million was recorded in SGA, and $49 million was recorded in Other income (expense), net. These charges consist of $47 million related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan bolivar at the SIMADI exchange rate (recorded in Other income (expense), net), $56 million related to reducing inventory to the lower of cost or market (recorded in COGS) and $49 million related to the impairment of long-lived assets in Venezuela (recorded primarily in COGS).\nAs expected, after moving to the SIMADI rate, our Venezuelan subsidiary utilized assets that continued to be remeasured at historical exchange rates. This resulted in an additional unfavorable impact of $17 million in the Latin America operating segment, including an impact to COGS of $12 million and SGA of $5 million. The total 2015 impact of moving from the CENCOEX official rate to the SIMADI rate was $169 million on a pre-tax basis, or approximately $.42 on a fully-diluted EPS basis.\nAs of January 2, 2016, certain non-monetary assets related to our Venezuelan subsidiary continue to be remeasured at historical exchange rates. As these assets are utilized by our Venezuelan subsidiary during the first half of 2016 they will be recognized in the income statement at historical exchange rates resulting in an unfavorable impact of approximately $4 million.\nShipping day differences\nThe Company's fiscal year normally ends on the Saturday closest to December 31 and as a result, a 53rd week is added approximately every sixth year. The Company's 2014 fiscal year ended on January 3, 2015, and included a 53rd week. While quarters normally consist of 13-week periods, the fourth quarter of 2014 included a 14th week. For comparability, the impact of the 53rd week is excluded from our comparable results. The impact of the fourth quarter 2014 53rd week was $197 million for net sales, $36 million for operating profit and $.07 on a fully-diluted EPS basis.\nForeign currency translation and the impact of Venezuela\nWe evaluate the operating results of our business on a currency-neutral basis. We determine currency-neutral operating results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.\nAs a result of our decision to change the exchange rate that we use to remeasure our Venezuela subsidiary from CENCOEX to the SIMADI exchange rate beginning mid-2015, the methodology we use to calculate the impact of foreign currency translation, as described above, results in certain year-over-year growth rates that require additional commentary. We believe that the use of our standard currency-neutral methodology in combination with the additional commentary provides important information to more fully understand our currency-neutral operating results.\nOur 2015 guidance that was maintained consistently throughout the year reflected an expectation of being approximately flat for currency-neutral comparable net sales and a decline of 2% to 4% for currency-neutral comparable operating profit. Within this guidance, Venezuela was expected to contribute approximately 1% of growth for both currency-neutral comparable net sales and currency-neutral comparable operating profit. In the second half of 2015, the Venezuela business experienced significant unplanned inflation that impacted both currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit that was much larger than anticipated in the guidance. To provide increased visibility into how we have delivered against our 2015 guidance, the commentary below provides both currency-neutral comparable results, which include the entire impact of Venezuela, as well as an adjusted measure that excludes the impact of Venezuela.\nFor the quarter ended January 2, 2016, Latin America currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth were 45.3% and 46.2% respectively. Excluding Venezuela, Latin America currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth would have been approximately 1.4% and 2.0%, respectively.\nFor the year-to-date period ended January 2, 2016, Latin America currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth were 24.6% and 15.4% respectively. Excluding Venezuela, Latin America currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth would have been approximately 1.3% and a decline of 3.4%, respectively.\nFor the quarter ended January 2, 2016, Kellogg Consolidated currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth was 4.2% and 2.8%, respectively. Excluding Venezuela, Kellogg Consolidated currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth would have been approximately 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.\nFor the year-to-date period ended January 2, 2016, Kellogg Consolidated currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth was 1.2% and a decline of 2.3%, respectively. Excluding Venezuela, Kellogg Consolidated currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit would have declined by 0.8% and 3.6%, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nComparability of certain financial measures is affected significantly by several types of financial impacts such as foreign currency translation, integration and transaction costs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans,\ncommodities and certain foreign currency contracts, Project K costs, costs associated with the Venezuela remeasurement and long-lived asset impairment, costs associated with the VIE deconsolidation, differences in shipping days, acquisitions, dispositions, and other costs impacting comparability. To provide increased transparency and assist in understanding our comparable operating performance, we use non-GAAP financial measures within MD&A that exclude these financial impacts.\nNon-GAAP financial measures used include comparable net sales, currency-neutral comparable net sales, comparable net sales growth, currency-neutral comparable net sales growth, comparable gross margin, currency-neutral comparable gross margin, comparable gross profit, currency-neutral comparable gross profit, comparable SGA%, currency-neutral comparable SGA%, comparable operating margin, currency-neutral comparable operating margin, comparable operating profit, currency-neutral comparable operating profit, comparable operating profit growth, currency-neutral comparable operating profit growth, comparable income taxes, currency-neutral comparable income taxes, comparable effective tax rate, currency-neutral comparable effective tax rate, comparable net income attributable to Kellogg Company, currency-neutral comparable net income attributable to Kellogg Company, comparable diluted EPS, currency-neutral comparable diluted EPS, comparable diluted EPS growth, and currency-neutral comparable diluted EPS growth.\nFinancial results\nFor the full year 2015, our reported net sales decreased by 7.2% due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation and shipping day differences from the 53rd week that was recognized in the prior year. Currency-neutral comparable net sales increased by 1.2%, which was better than our expectations, and includes the benefit of pricing taken in Venezuela to offset cost inflation. We experienced currency-neutral comparable net sales growth in Latin America, which was driven primarily by pricing taken in Venezuela. We also experienced currency-neutral comparable net sales growth in Asia-Pacific, U. S. Specialty and the Canadian business which is included in the North America Other reportable segment.\nReported operating profit increased by 6.6% primarily due to the favorable year-over-year change in the pension mark-to-market which was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation, the impact of remeasuring our Venezuela business using the SIMADI rate in the second quarter of 2015, and the impact of resetting incentive compensation levels. Currency-neutral comparable operating profit declined by 2.3%, at the high end of our expectations, due to the resetting of incentive compensation levels which impacted results by approximately 3%. The 1% growth excluding the effect of resetting incentive compensation levels was the result of sales growth and a 50 basis point reduction in brand-building investment as a percentage of net sales. Our brand building is down including shifts of investment into other areas such as food, the evolving shift in media investment from TV to digital, and efficiency and effectiveness benefits. Our zero-based budgeting initiative may identify additional efficiency and effectiveness opportunities in brand building as we proceed through 2016. We may choose to reinvest these savings back into brand building or other areas such as food reformulation or capacity to drive revenue growth. We remain committed to invest in our brands at an industry-leading level to maintain the strength of our many recognizable brands in the marketplace.\nReported diluted EPS of $1.72 was down 1.7% compared to the prior year of $1.75. Reported diluted EPS was impacted negatively by Project K costs ($.64), mark-to-market accounting ($.84), the remeasurement of the Venezuelan business using the SIMADI rate ($.42), foreign currency translation ($.28), and integration costs ($.06), and was impacted positively by a VIE deconsolidation ($.14) and acquisitions ($.01). Currency-neutral comparable diluted EPS of $3.81 was flat compared to prior year of $3.81, in line with our expectations.\nReconciliation of certain non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nFor more information on reconciling items in the table above, please refer to the Significant items impacting comparability section.\n\nFor more information on reconciling items in the table above, please refer to the Significant items impacting comparability section.\nNet sales and operating profit\n2015 compared to 2014\nThe following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2015 versus 2014:\n\nFor more information on reconciling items in the table above, please refer to the Significant items impacting comparability section.\n\nFor more information on reconciling items in the table above, please refer to the Significant items impacting comparability section.\nU.S. Morning Foods\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 1.6% as a result of unfavorable volume and pricing/mix. This segment consists of cereal, toaster pastries, health and wellness bars, and beverages.\nWe saw a lot of improvement across the year in the Morning Foods business. We invested where we needed\nto and worked hard to improve the fundamentals by improving our brand building and the new products we\nlaunched. We also invested in our foods and put fun back in the box with Avengers\u00ae and Disney Frozen\u00ae-themed cereals.\nOur cereal business reported a decline for the full year, although we continued to reflect improving trends throughout the year, and we reported consumption growth and share gains in the fourth quarter as our business continues to improve ahead of category trends. Our six core cereals in combination (Special K\u00ae, Raisin Bran\u00ae, Frosted Flakes\u00ae, Mini-Wheats\u00ae, Froot Loops\u00ae, and Rice Krispies\u00ae) gained share and increased consumption for the year, with even stronger growth in both share and consumption in the fourth quarter. Special K\u00ae posted consumption growth and share gains for the year and even stronger results for the fourth quarter driven primarily by the renovation work we completed on Special K\u00ae Red Berries. The good growth we saw all year on Raisin Bran\u00ae was the result of great advertising and the introduction of Raisin Bran\u00ae with Cranberries.\nWe expect to continue driving sales in 2016 with the introduction of new products like Special K\u00ae Nourish, a cereal with positive nutrition and ingredients the consumer can see, and the food includes fruits, nuts and on-trend grains like quinoa. Initial response on this innovation has been encouraging. In addition, we're launching Mini-Wheats\u00ae Harvest Delights, Smorz\u00ae, and Disney Dory\u00ae-themed cereal.\nToaster pastries reported a slight sales decline for the year. Health and wellness bars and beverages each reported a sales decline.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit increased 2.1% due to improved gross margins resulting from lower input costs and Project K savings as well as lower brand-building investment. This was partially offset by the sales performance, increased distribution costs, and resetting of incentive compensation levels.\nU.S. Snacks\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 1.6% as a result of decreased volume which was partially offset by favorable pricing/mix. This segment consists of crackers, cereal bars, cookies, savory snacks, and fruit-flavored snacks.\nCrackers posted a sales decline as consumption declined across several of our products, while consumption increased for our Big 3 brands in combination (Cheez-It\u00ae , Town House\u00ae, and Club\u00ae). The consumption decline was due primarily to weakness in Special K\u00ae Cracker Chips during the first half of the year and full-year weakness in Special K\u00ae Popcorn Chips. The Special K\u00ae Cracker Chips products we restaged earlier this year posted consumption growth for the past two quarters as a result of improvements in packaging and food. We expect the impact of the remaining skus to lessen as we progress through 2016. The consumption increase for our Big 3 brands was primarily the result of strong consumption and share gains in Cheez-It\u00ae due to the Cheez-It\u00ae Grooves and Cheez-It\u00ae Extra Toasty innovations.\nThe bars business declined due to weakness in the Special K\u00ae and Fiber Plus\u00ae brands. The performance of our Special K bars has improved in the second half of the year as a result of new products and renovation that occurred early in the year and good results from Special K\u00ae Chewy Nut bars that were launched in mid-2015. Rice Krispies Treats\u00ae reported double-digit consumption gains and gained share as a result of good core growth and innovation.\nThe cookies business consumption declined for the year resulting in lost share, although we have seen improving trends over the second half of 2015 as a result of good performance in Chips Deluxe\u00ae, Fudge Shoppe\u00ae, and Famous Amos\u00ae due to expanded distribution, new products, and increased in-store activity. We have great brands in the category and we have some exciting new introductions planned for 2016. We are also going to give the brands new support in 2016, including the relaunch of advertising featuring the Keebler\u00ae Elves.\nSavory snacks reported low-single-digit growth as a result of consumption growth due to core products and innovations. The Pringles\u00ae business had a good year including strength in the on-the-go segment. As we enter the\nnew year we are adding new capacity and we have good plans; as a result, we look forward to a strong 2016.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined by 11.3% due to unfavorable sales performance and the resetting of incentive compensation levels.\nU.S. Specialty\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales increased 0.7% as a result of favorable pricing/mix which was partially offset by decreased volume. Sales growth was reported in the Convenience and Vending channels, partially offset by a slight decline in Foodservice partially due to the exit of some unprofitable business early in the year.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined by 0.8% due to the resetting of incentive compensation levels which more than offset the favorable sales performance.\nNorth America Other\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 3.2% due to decreased volume and unfavorable pricing/mix.\nThe U.S. Frozen business reported a net sales decline due to the impact from egg prices, network improvements, and a decision to draw down inventories due to changes in packaging from boxes to bags for our veggie foods business. The packaging conversion is going well, but we expect sales to continue to be impacted in the first quarter of 2016 and for performance to improve over the balance of the year. The Eggo\u00ae hand-held sandwiches posted double-digit consumption growth and share gains for the year.\nThe Canada business reported a broad-based net sales increase across several categories for the year. For 2016, the Canadian team is planning introductions of new products and improved support, much like the rest of the North American region.\nKashi reported a double-digit net sales decline although the business continues to experience stabilized distribution and sequential improvement across the last two quarters in part due to the impact of the introduction of new products in the second half of 2015. Bear Naked\u00ae Granola posted double-digit consumption growth for the year. We expect continued improvement in 2016 due to further improvement in distribution and the impact of a focus on new products high in protein from plants.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined 16.1% primarily due to unfavorable sales performance in the U.S. Frozen and Kashi businesses, net cost inflation including transactional currency expense in the Canadian business and increased material costs in the U.S. Frozen business, and the resetting of incentive compensation levels.\nEurope\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 0.6% as a result of relatively flat volume and unfavorable pricing/mix.\nThe Pringles\u00ae business posted strong, double-digit net sales growth as a result of good promotions, innovations and distribution gains throughout the year. Both the base business and the launch of Pringles\u00ae Tortilla in the UK and Germany contributed. We have some exciting activity planned for Pringles\u00ae in 2016 as well, including soccer-themed activity planned to coincide with the Euros soccer tournament in the summer and the continued roll-out of Pringles\u00ae Tortilla in the region.\nThe wholesome snacks business posted growth in the second half of the year. This was due to better results in the UK driven in part by Disney\u00ae-branded snacks, mini biscuits, Crunchy Nut\u00ae, and Rice Krispies Squares\u00ae. In addition, the Russian business did well. We also have new foods coming across the region in 2016.\nThe Cereal business in Europe declined due to challenges in the category in many of the countries. However, we improved our plans for Special K\u00ae and Crunchy Nut\u00ae in the UK, saw good performance from Extra\u00ae in Italy, and\ninvested behind Kellogg's\u00ae-branded granola in Germany. Also, we recently launched the Ancient Legends\u00ae brands in the region. These are great products, which include on-trend ingredients like spelt, apples, sultanas, and chia seeds. We are also applying learnings from our US cereal business including the renovation of Special K\u00ae Red Berries, the launch of Special K\u00ae Nourish, and we're also adding more fun in the box.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit improved 4.3% due to net cost deflation and strong savings, including savings from Project K.\nLatin America\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales improved 24.6% due to favorable volume and pricing/mix, including the impact of pricing actions in Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, currency-neutral comparable net sales would have grown 1.3%.\nWe experienced volume growth in several of our markets, including Mexico. We also realized strong price realization in Venezuela as a result of pricing actions taken to offset cost inflation. Cereal sales in the region increased and we have held or gained share in most of the region. These share gains have been driven by children's and family brands and the introduction of Kellogg-branded granolas and muesli products.\nSales in the snacks business also increased driven by innovation and go-to-market activity. The Pringles\u00ae business continued to perform well and we have launched Pringles\u00ae Tortilla in the region.\nOur focus on high-frequency stores continues to drive results. We've seen results in Convenience and mini-Super stores in Mexico, and in smaller stores in Colombia. We have also had success driving sales growth through packaging initiatives designed to drive affordability and accessibility in various areas of the business.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit improved by 15.4% due to favorable price realization which was partially offset by net cost inflation. Excluding Venezuela, currency neutral comparable operating profit declined 3.4% as sales growth and margin expansion were more than offset by increased investment in brand-building and business capabilities.\nAsia Pacific\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales increased 4.0% as a result of increased volume which was partially offset by unfavorable pricing/mix. Unfavorable pricing/mix was primarily the result of country mix.\nThe sales increase was the result of double-digit growth in the Asian markets, double-digit growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, and mid-single-digit growth in the savory snacks business across the region. The growth in Asia included double-digit sales growth in Japan driven by the continued growth of the granola category and the impact of new packaging as well as double-digit growth in Korea and Southeast Asia. The savory snacks business reported broad-based sales growth and share gains due to innovation and gains in distribution.\nThis sales performance was partially offset by weakness in the Australian cereal category. However, the granola and m\u00fcesli segments are growing well and we have a plan to address the weakness in the overall Australian business in 2016. We are also applying lessons learned in our US business to our Australia business.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined 3.7% as our investment of Project K savings into emerging markets in the region behind brand investments and capabilities more than offset the favorable sales performance.\nCorporate\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined due to the resetting of incentive compensation levels which was partially offset by reduced pension costs.\n2014 compared to 2013\nThe following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2014 versus 2013:\n\nFor more information on reconciling items in the table above, please refer to the Significant items impacting comparability section.\n\nFor more information on reconciling items in the table above, please refer to the Significant items impacting comparability section.\nU.S. Morning Foods\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 4.8% as a result of unfavorable volume and pricing/mix. This segment consists of cereal, toaster pastries, health and wellness bars, and beverages.\nThe cereal category continued to decline through the year despite our continued investments behind category-building programs that started early in the year. Much of our decline in the cereal category has come from Special K\u00ae. We experienced weakness in Special K\u00ae as it faced headwinds from evolving consumer trends regarding weight management. As a result, we changed the positioning of the brand from a focus on dieting to weight wellness. This focus will stress the role that Special K\u00ae plays in a healthy lifestyle. We have begun the execution of this new positioning for the overall cereal business through the following initiatives:\n \u2022 We have launched the See You at Breakfast campaign and the Open for Breakfast digital program designed to help us connect directly with consumers \n \u2022 We are revitalizing the Special K\u00ae brand and are launching new products such as Special K\u00ae Gluten-free and Special K\u00ae Protein \nWe expect that these actions will have a positive impact on the performance of the Special K\u00ae, and on the cereal business as a whole. Our plan for investment is long-term and the levels, content, and effectiveness of the support will evolve, and increase over time.\nToaster pastries reported a sales decline for the year as a result of difficult comparisons due to the peanut butter innovations launched in 2013. However we did gain share for the year and introduced a new PB&J innovation in November and we expect this to improve sales results. Health and wellness bars and beverages each reported a sales decline for the year.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined 10.0% due to the unfavorable sales performance and a mid-single-digit increase in cereal brand-building investment. This was partially offset by a decrease in brand-building investment behind health and wellness bars and beverages, and continued cost discipline.\nU.S. Snacks\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 2.8% as a result of decreased volume partially offset by favorable pricing/mix. This segment consists of crackers, cereal bars, cookies, savory snacks, and fruit-flavored snacks.\nCrackers posted a slight sales increase and gained share as a result of the continued success of Cheez-It\u00ae innovations and core products in the Town House\u00ae, and Club\u00ae brands due to brand-building support and sales execution. Cheez-It\u00ae, Town House\u00ae, and Club\u00ae all reported solid consumption and share gains. The gains in these three brands have been offset by weakness in Special K\u00ae Cracker Chips due to similar consumer trends that we have experienced in the cereal category. We have addressed this weakness by launching completely restaged Cracker Chips with new flavors, better flavor and texture profiles, improved packaging, and new positioning. This new product started to arrive in stores in late 2014.\nThe bars business declined due to weakness in the Special K\u00ae and Fiber Plus\u00ae brands. The issues with these brands are similar to what we have experienced in the cereal category. To address these issues we launched new products and activities in the fourth quarter of this year and will launch more new, great-tasting Special K\u00ae snack bars with new packaging and new positioning. This activity ties into the initiatives we are launching in other categories and regions around the world. This new product started to arrive in stores in late December. Rice Krispies Treats\u00ae and Nutri-grain\u00ae both reported consumption gains and gained share as a result of good core growth and innovation.\nThe cookies business declined resulting in lost share. However we saw share gains from Chips Deluxe\u00ae as a result of new co-branded products. We experienced soft performance in our 100-calorie packs business throughout the year. We are migrating consumers to an expanded line of single-serve products, which should help to reduce the impact of the decline. We also experienced the negative impact of a SKU rationalization initiative.\nSavory snacks reported mid-single-digit sales growth and held share for the year behind the performance of the core business, Grab \u2018n Go, and the new Pringles\u00ae Tortilla product.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined by 10.9% due to unfavorable sales performance and net cost inflation. This was partially offset by continued cost discipline.\nU.S. Specialty\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 1.2% as a result of decreased volume and unfavorable pricing/mix. Sales declines were the result of the negative impact of weather early in the year, supply issues with a co-packer, and an inventory de-load as a customer shifted from warehouse to direct delivery.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined by 1.5% due to the unfavorable sales performance. This was partially offset by cost discipline.\nNorth America Other\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 3.2% due to decreased volume and unfavorable pricing/mix.\nThe U.S. Frozen business reported a decline due to unfavorable comparisons early in the year resulting from strong prior-year growth behind innovation activity and costs later in the year associated with the launch of new products. New Eggo\u00ae Bites and Eggo\u00ae handheld sandwiches performed well during the year. The combination of the Eggo\u00ae handheld sandwiches and good results from our Special K\u00ae handheld sandwiches resulted in a double-digit sales increase for our sandwich business during our final quarter of the year. Consumption of Eggo\u00ae waffles is improving as we have re-launched the L'Eggo My Eggo\u00ae brand-building program and launched Eggo\u00ae gluten-free and a new variety of Thick-n-Fluffy waffles.\nCanada reported a slight increase in sales driven primarily by the snacks business as volumes increased at a low single-digit rate.\nKashi reported a decline in sales as we continued to experience softness in the cereal category. We have identified areas of focus for Kashi\u00ae which is a great brand in a category that is on trend. We have begun the execution of this new positioning through the following initiatives:\n \u2022 All Kashi Go-Lean\u00ae products will be Non GMO Project Verified \n \u2022 All Kashi Heart-to-Heart\u00ae products will meet the USDA's Organic standard \nWe expect that these initiatives will have a positive impact on the performance of Kashi\u00ae.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined 3.8% primarily due to unfavorable sales performance. This was partially offset by continued cost discipline.\nEurope\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales declined 0.8% as a result of flat volume and unfavorable pricing/mix. Cereal category consumption remains soft in most developed markets, similar to the cereal category in the U.S. Emerging markets reported good growth for the year in both cereal and snacks. To address the cereal category softness, we executed brand-building activities in the second half of the year. New Special K\u00ae advertising has recently gone on air which addresses the recent health and wellness trends that have negatively impacted this brand.\nSavory snacks performed well throughout the year, with the final quarter of 2014 reporting the highest sales since we acquired the business. New products are launching, including Pringles\u00ae Tortilla, and we have more capacity coming on-line mid-year.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit improved 7.4% due to net cost deflation, including strong productivity savings, and decreased brand-building investment. This was partially offset by unfavorable sales performance.\nLatin America\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales improved 3.9% due to favorable pricing/mix which was partially offset by decreased volume. Strong price realization, primarily from Venezuela, has more than offset sales declines early in the year resulting from the volume elasticity impact of the introduction of a new food tax in Mexico. We reported growth in Venezuela, Mercosur, and the Pringles business as well as pricing gains in a majority of our markets. The\ncereal business posted good results, although we saw some competitive price promotions in Mexico which affected selected segments. The momentum of the savory snacks business continues, driven by strong commercial programs, innovation, and good execution.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit improved by 9.0% due to favorable sales performance which was partially offset by net cost inflation, increased brand-building investment to support innovation and new programs, and increased overhead investment.\nAsia Pacific\nCurrency-neutral comparable net sales increased 0.8% as a result of flat volume and favorable pricing/mix. The sales increase was the result of double-digit growth in the Asian markets and high-single-digit growth in the savory snacks business across the region. This sales performance was partially offset by weakness in the Australian cereal category and our performance in South Africa as we conducted construction work early in the year and it took longer than expected to bring the plant back on line.\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit declined 7.3% due to the weakness in the Australian cereal category and our performance in South Africa. This was partially offset by cost discipline.\nCorporate\nCurrency-neutral comparable operating profit improved as a result of reduced pension costs which was partially offset by increased overhead investments.\nMargin performance\n2015 versus 2014 margin performance was as follows:\n\nFor information on the reconciling items in the table above, please refer to the Significant items impacting comparability section.\n (a) Reported gross margin as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin is equal to net sales less cost of goods sold. \nCurrency-neutral comparable gross margin declined by 10 basis points in 2015 due to the impact of Venezuela. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, currency-neutral comparable gross margin would have increased by 20 basis points as a result of productivity savings, Project K savings, and deflation in commodities and packaging which was partially offset by higher distribution costs and investment in our foods such as the launch of granolas and mueslis across the globe and the renovation of existing foods such as Special K\u00ae.\nCurrency-neutral comparable SG&A% was worse by 40 basis points as a result of resetting incentive compensation, reinvestment of Project K savings into sales capabilities including adding sales representatives, and re-establishing the Kashi business unit which was partially offset by improvements resulting from efficiency and effectiveness programs as well as decreased brand building investment.\nOur 2015 and 2014 comparable gross profit, comparable SGA, and comparable operating profit measures are reconciled to the directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures as follows:\n\nFor more information on the reconciling items in the table above, please refer to the Significant items impacting comparability section.\n (a) Gross profit is equal to net sales less cost of goods sold. \n2014 versus 2013 margin performance was as follows:\n\nFor more information on reconciling items in the table above, please refer to the Significant items impacting comparability section.\nCurrency-neutral comparable gross margin declined by 40 basis points in 2014 due to the impact of inflation, net of productivity savings, and lower production volume resulting from soft sales performance. Currency-neutral comparable SG&A% improved by 20 basis points as a result of continued discipline in overhead control.\nOur 2014 and 2013 comparable gross profit, comparable SGA, and comparable operating profit measures are reconciled to the directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures as follows:\n\nFor more information on reconciling items in the table above, please refer to the Significant items impacting comparability section.\nRestructuring and cost reduction activities\nWe view our continued spending on restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our long-term profit growth targets. Initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a five-year period of completion. Upon completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi-year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation.\nProject K\nProject K, a four-year efficiency and effectiveness program, was announced in November 2013, and is expected to generate a significant amount of savings that may be invested in key strategic areas of focus for the business. We expect that this investment will drive future growth in revenues, gross margin, operating profit, and cash flow.\nThe focus of the program will be to strengthen existing businesses in core markets, increase growth in developing and emerging markets, and drive an increased level of value-added innovation. The program is expected to provide a number of benefits, including an optimized supply chain infrastructure, the implementation of global business services, and a new global focus on categories.\nWe currently anticipate that Project K will result in total pre-tax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, of $1.2 to $1.4 billion, with after-tax cash costs, including incremental capital investments, estimated to be $900 million to $1.1 billion. Cash expenditures of approximately $625 million have been incurred through the end of fiscal year 2015. Total cash expenditures, as defined, are expected to be approximately $150 million for 2016 and the balance of $125 to $325 million thereafter. Total charges for Project K in 2016 are expected to be approximately $175 to $200 million.\nWe expect annual cost savings generated from Project K will be approximately $425 to $475 million by 2018, with approximately two-thirds of the cost savings to be realized in cost of goods sold. We have realized approximately $180 million of annual savings through the end of 2015. We expect approximately $100 million of incremental savings in 2016, approximately 75 to 80 percent of which will come from cost of goods sold. Cost savings will be utilized to increase margins and drive sales growth through additional investments in advertising, in-store execution, sales capabilities, including adding sales representatives, re-establishing the Kashi business unit, and in the design and quality of our products. We will also invest in production capacity in developing and emerging markets, and in global category teams.\nAs a result of Project K, capital spending levels were increased to 4% of net sales during both 2014 and 2015. Our on-going business model assumes capital spending to be approximately 3-4% of net sales annually.\nThus far, we have funded much of the cash requirements for Project K through our supplier financing initiative. Due to the difference in timing between expected cash costs for the project and expected future cash savings, we anticipate funding the project through a combination of cash on hand and short-term debt.\nWe also expect that the project will have an impact on our consolidated effective income tax rate during the execution of the project due to the timing of charges being taken in different tax jurisdictions. The impact of this project on our consolidated effective income tax rate will be excluded from the comparable income tax rate that will be disclosed on a quarterly basis.\nRefer to Note 4 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to Project K and other restructuring activities.\nOther Projects\nIn 2015 we initiated the implementation of a zero-based budgeting (ZBB) program in our North America business. This ZBB program is expected to deliver visibility to $100 million in annual savings in North America during 2016. We will begin to expand ZBB into our international businesses during 2016 with modest savings expected in certain locations in 2016. We expect increased savings to be realized in our international businesses in 2017 and beyond.\nIn support of the ZBB initiative, we incurred pre-tax charges of approximately $12 million in 2015. We anticipate that ZBB will result in cumulative pre-tax charges of approximately $25 to $50 million through 2016 which will consist primarily of the design and implementation of business capabilities.\nForeign currency translation\nThe reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in the euro, British pound, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Venezuelan bolivar fuerte, and Russian ruble. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates. As a result, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. This could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar is substantial.\nInterest expense\nAnnual interest expense is illustrated in the following table. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to a higher average level of long-term debt and to higher interest rates, partially resulting from lower levels of debt swapped to a variable rate. The decline in 2014 was primarily due to refinancing of maturing long-term debt at lower interest rates and lower interest rates on long-term debt which has effectively been converted to floating rate obligations through the use of interest rate swaps. Interest income (recorded in other income (expense), net) was (in millions), 2015-$4; 2014-$8; 2013-$7. We currently expect that our 2016 gross interest expense will be approximately $235 to $245 million.\n\nIncome taxes\nOur reported effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 20.6%, 22.6% and 30.4% respectively. Comparable effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 25.6%, 28.2%, and 28.4%, respectively.\nThe 2015 and 2014 effective income tax rates benefited from the mark-to-market loss recorded for our pension plans. Refer to Note 12 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon U.S. dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates. Additionally, the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters, including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives, are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of as reported to currency-neutral comparable income taxes and effective income tax rate for 2015 and 2014.\n\nFor more information on reconciling items in the table above, please refer to the Significant items impacting comparability section.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of as reported to currency-neutral comparable income taxes and effective income tax rate for 2014 and 2013.\n\nFor more information on reconciling items in the table above, please refer to the Significant items impacting comparability section.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions. Our cash-generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs.\nWe have historically reported negative working capital primarily as the result of our focus to improve core working capital by reducing our levels of trade receivables and inventory while extending the timing of payment of our trade payables. In addition, we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which results in current maturities of long-term debt and notes payable which can have a significant impact on working capital as a result of the timing of these required payments. These factors, coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, pay dividends, fund acquisition opportunities, and repurchase our common stock, reduce our working capital amounts. We had negative working capital of $2.5 billion and $1.0 billion as of January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, respectively.\nWe believe that our operating cash flows, together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that volatility and/or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nAs of January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, we had $231 million and $257 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents held in international jurisdictions which will be used to fund capital and other cash requirements of international operations. These amounts include $2 million and $68 million at January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, respectively, subject to currency exchange controls in Venezuela, limiting the total amount of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries that can be repatriated at any particular point in time.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows:\n\nOperating activities\nThe principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings, meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products, net of costs to manufacture and market our products.\nOur net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 amounted to $1,691 million, a decrease of $102 million compared with 2014. The decrease compared to the prior year is the result of the negative year over year impact of accounts receivable mitigated somewhat by the incremental cash flow benefit from the supplier financing initiative of approximately $210 million. Our net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 amounted to $1,793 million, a decrease of $14 million compared with 2013, due primarily to the negative incremental impact of Project K cash requirements mitigated somewhat by the positive impact from the supplier financing initiative of approximately $210 million.\nAfter-tax cash payments related to Project K were $192 million in 2015, $187 million in 2014, and $18 million in 2013.\nOur cash conversion cycle (defined as days of inventory, excluding inventoriable mark-to-market pension costs, and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding, based on a trailing 12 month average) is relatively short, equating to approximately 14 days and 27 days for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Core working capital in 2015 averaged 6.2% of net sales, compared to 7.6% in 2014 and 7.8% in 2013. In 2015, both our cash conversion cycle and core working capital showed improvements in days of trade payables outstanding which includes the positive impact of a supplier financing initiative. Days of trade receivables and inventory on hand increased slightly from 2014 to 2015.\nOur total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to $33 million, $53 million and $48 million, in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe Pension Protection Act (PPA), and subsequent regulations, determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the United States. We believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under PPA requirements until 2021 or beyond. Our projections concerning timing of PPA funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance, future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the PPA.\nWe currently project that we will make total U.S. and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2016 of approximately $43 million. Actual 2016 contributions could be different from our current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities, future changes in government requirements, trust asset performance, renewals of union contracts, or higher-than-expected health care claims cost experience.\nWe measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. We use this non-GAAP financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases. Our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure, as follows:\n\nThe decrease in cash flow (as defined) in 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to the unfavorable year over year impact of accounts receivable mitigated somewhat by the favorable year over year impact of trade payables as a result of the supplier financing initiative. The increase in cash flow in 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to lower capital expenditures and improved core working capital partially offset by the negative impact of Project K cash requirements.\nInvesting activities\nOur net cash used in investing activities for 2015 amounted to $1,127 million, an increase of $554 million compared with 2014. In 2015, we acquired, for $445 million, a 50% interest in Multipro Singapore Pte. Ltd., a leading distributor of a variety of food products in Nigeria and Ghana, and an option to purchase a minority interest in an affiliated food manufacturer. In addition to our joint venture investment in 2015, we also acquired Mass Foods and a majority interest in Bisco Misr.\nCapital spending in 2015 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure, and to support capacity requirements in certain markets and products, including Pringles in Asia-Pacific.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $573 million in 2014 decreased $68 million compared with 2013.\nCash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales increased to 4.1% in 2015, from 4.0% in 2014, which was a decrease from 4.3% in 2013.\nFinancing activities\nOur net cash used by financing activities was $706 million, $1,063 million and $1,141 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The use of cash in financing activities compared to the prior year declined due primarily to net proceeds from notes payable of $374 million in 2015 versus $89 million in 2014.\nTotal debt was $7.8 billion and $7.4 billion at year-end 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn May 2015, we repaid our $350 million 1.125% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2015 at maturity.\nIn February 2015, we repaid our floating-rate $250 million U.S. Dollar Notes due 2015 at maturity and in March 2015, we issued \u20ac600 million of ten-year 1.25% Euro Notes due 2025.\nIn March 2014, we redeemed $150 million of our 4.00% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2020, $342 million of our 3.125% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2022 and $189 million of our 2.75% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2023. In connection with the debt redemption, we incurred $1 million of interest expense, offset by $8 million of accelerated gains on interest rate hedges previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, and incurred $5 million expense, recorded in Other Income, Expense (net), related to acceleration of fees on the redeemed debt and fees related to the tender offer.\nIn May 2014, we issued \u20ac500 million of seven-year 1.75% Euro Notes due 2021, using the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which included repayment of a portion of our commercial paper borrowings.\nIn May 2014, we issued Cdn. $300 million of three-year 2.05% Canadian Dollar Notes due 2017, using the proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay our Cdn. $300 million, 2.10% Notes due May 2014 at maturity.\nIn February 2013, we issued $250 million of two-year floating-rate U.S. Dollar Notes, and $400 million of ten-year 2.75% U.S. Dollar Notes, resulting in aggregate net proceeds after debt discount of $645 million. The proceeds from these Notes were used for general corporate purposes, including, together with cash on hand, repayment of the $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% U.S. Dollar Notes due March 2013.\nIn April 2013, the board of directors approved a $1 billion share repurchase program expiring in April 2014. In February 2014, the board of directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion in shares through December 2015. In December 2015, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to $1.5 billion beginning in 2016 through December 2017.\nDuring 2015, we purchased 11 million shares totaling $731 million. During 2014, we purchased 11 million shares totaling $690 million. In May 2013, we entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) Agreement with a financial institution counterparty and paid $355 million for the purchase of shares during the term of the agreement which extended through August 2013. The total number of shares delivered upon settlement of the ASR was based upon the volume weighted average price of the Company's stock over the term of the agreement. Total shares\npurchased in 2013, including shares delivered under the ASR, amounted to approximately 9 million shares totaling $544 million.\nWe paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling $1.98 per share in 2015, $1.90 per share in 2014 and $1.80 per share in 2013. Total cash paid for dividends increased by 3.0% in 2015 and 4.0% in 2014. In February 2016, the board of directors declared a dividend of $.50 per common share, payable on March 15, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2016.\nIn February 2014, we entered into an unsecured Five-Year Credit Agreement to replace the existing unsecured Four-Year Credit Agreement, which would have expired in March 2015. The Five-Year Credit Agreement allows us to borrow, on a revolving credit basis, up to $2.0 billion.\nOur long-term debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit Kellogg Company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and lease-back transactions. Some agreements also contain change in control provisions. However, they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings. A change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the U.S. short-term debt market and/or increase the cost of refinancing long-term debt in the future. However, even under these circumstances, we would continue to have access to our Five-Year Credit Agreement, which expires in February 2019. This source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis, although we do not currently plan to use it.\nWe monitor the financial strength of our third-party financial institutions, including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities, our derivative financial instruments, and other arrangements.\nWe are in compliance with all covenants as of January 2, 2016. We continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future, while still meeting our operational needs, including the pursuit of selected bolt-on acquisitions. This will be accomplished through our strong cash flow, our short-term borrowings, and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis. We anticipate establishing a discrete customer program which would allow for extended customer payment terms. In connection with this program, we may enter into an agreement with one or more financial institutions to monetize these receivables resulting in the receivables being de-recognized from our consolidated balance sheet. We currently estimate that the amount of these receivables held at any time by the financial institution(s) will be approximately $500 to $600 million.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nAs of January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015 we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at January 2, 2016:\n\n (a) Includes interest payments on our long-term debt and payments on our interest rate swaps. Interest calculated on our variable rate debt was forecasted using the LIBOR forward rate curve as of January 2, 2016. \n (b) The total expected cash payments on our capital leases include interest expense totaling less than $1 million over the periods presented above. \n (c) Operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. \n (d) Purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business and for marketing, advertising and other services. The amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or other current liabilities at year-end 2015, nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans, but are not obligated to incur. Therefore, it should be noted that the exclusion of these items from the table could be a limitation in assessing our total future cash flows under contracts. \n (e) As of January 2, 2016, our total liability for uncertain tax positions was $73 million, of which $13 million is expected to be paid in the next twelve months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining $60 million. \n (f) Other long-term obligations are those associated with noncurrent liabilities recorded within the Consolidated Balance Sheet at year-end 2015 and consist principally of projected commitments under deferred compensation arrangements, multiemployer plans, and supplemental employee retirement benefits. The table also includes our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans through 2021 as follows: 2016-$43; 2017-$34; 2018-$34; 2019-$34; 2020-$103; 2021-$190. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nPromotional expenditures\nOur promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in-store displays and events, feature price discounts, consumer coupons, contests and loyalty programs. The costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer. These estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. Differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. On a full-year basis, these subsequent period adjustments represent approximately 0.4% of our company's net sales. However, our company's total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a revenue reduction) are significant, so it is likely our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.\nProperty\nLong-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Management evaluates several conditions, including, but not limited to, the following: a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, including an extended period of idleness; and a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. For assets to be held and used, we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the long-lived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset. If the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data. There are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses.\nAt January 2, 2016, we have property, plant and equipment of $3.6 billion, net of accumulated depreciation, on our balance sheet. Included in this amount are approximately $51 million of idle assets.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\nWe perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process.\nGoodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. For the 2015 goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples. Our approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units. In the event the fair value determined using the market multiples approach is close to the carrying value, we may also supplement our fair value determination using discounted cash flows. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units.\nSimilarly, impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset. Fair values of non-goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset. For instance, cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants. These estimates are made using various inputs including historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market comparables.\nWe also evaluate the useful life over which a non-goodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.\nAt January 2, 2016, goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to $7.2 billion, consisting primarily of goodwill and brands associated with the 2001 acquisition of Keebler Foods Company and the 2012 acquisition of Pringles. Within this total, approximately $2.2 billion of non-goodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinite-lived, comprised principally of Keebler and Pringles trademarks. We currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows. The percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the U.S. Snacks reporting unit was approximately 43% and 59% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. However, if we had used materially different assumptions, which we do not believe are reasonably possible, regarding the future performance of our business or a different market multiple in the valuation, this could have resulted in significant impairment losses. Additionally, we have $25 million of goodwill related to our 2008 acquisition of United Bakers in Russia. Fair value of the intangibles for this business exceeded carrying value in 2015. If we used modestly different assumptions regarding sales multiples and EBITDA in the valuation, this could have resulted in an impairment loss. Management will continue to monitor the situation closely.\nRetirement benefits\nOur company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the United States and Canada. Plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance. A substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments. We recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees' active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans. Inherent in this concept is the requirement to\nuse various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date. Major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the health care cost trend rates, the mortality table and improvement scale, and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans, which cover employees in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.\nOur expense recognition policy for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits is to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually as of our measurement date, which is our fiscal year-end, or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles.\nAdditionally, for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits we use the fair value of plan assets.\nTo conduct our annual review of the long-term rate of return on plan assets, we model expected returns over a 20-year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans. The return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long-term bonds, price-earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and long-term inflation. Our U.S. plan model, corresponding to approximately 68% of our trust assets globally, currently incorporates a long-term inflation assumption of 2.5% and an active management premium of 1% (net of fees) validated by historical analysis and future return expectations. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return annually, our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our expected rates of return have generally not been revised, provided these rates continue to fall within a more likely than not\u201d corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected long-term returns, as determined by our modeling process. Our assumed rate of return for U.S. plans in 2016 of 8.5% equates to approximately the 57th percentile expectation of our model. Similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets, reflecting local economic conditions. Foreign trust investments represent approximately 32% of our global benefit plan assets.\nBased on consolidated benefit plan assets at January 2, 2016, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would correspondingly increase or decrease 2016 benefits expense by approximately\n$55 million. For each of the three fiscal years, our actual return on plan assets exceeded (was less than) the recognized assumed return by the following amounts (in millions): 2015-$(666); 2014-$(41); 2013-$545.\nTo conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates, we model our actual claims cost data over a five-year historical period, including an analysis of pre-65 versus post-65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population. This data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends. Our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short-term future trends. In comparison to our actual five-year compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 4.95%, our initial trend rate for 2016 of 5.00% reflects the expected future impact of faster-growing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population. Our initial rate is trended downward by 0.25% per year, until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5% is reached. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Based on consolidated obligations at January 2, 2016, a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2016 benefits expense by approximately $4 million and generate an immediate loss recognition of $89 million. A 100 basis point excess of 2016 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an experience loss of approximately $4 million and would increase 2016 expense by $0.2 million. Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur. The experience loss arising from recognition of 2015 claims experience was approximately $3 million.\nAssumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize. At the end of 2014, we revised our mortality assumption after considering the Society of Actuaries' (SOA) updated mortality tables and improvement scale, as well as other mortality information available from the Social Security Administration to develop assumptions aligned with our expectation of future improvement rates. In determining the appropriate mortality assumptions as of January 2, 2016, we considered the SOA's 2015 updated improvement scale and believe our assumption remains appropriate.\nTo conduct our annual review of discount rates, we selected the discount rate based on a cash-flow matching analysis using Willis Towers Watson's proprietary RATE:Link tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans. RATE:Link establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments, as is generated by discounting each year's benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. The spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of U.S. high quality bonds. A similar methodology is applied in Canada and Europe, except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable. We use a December 31 measurement date for our defined benefit plans. Accordingly, we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during December of each year.\nBased on consolidated obligations at January 2, 2016, a 25 basis point decline in the weighted-average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would decrease 2016 benefits expense by approximately $2 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of $222 million. All obligation-related actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur.\nDespite the previously-described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions, we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience. During 2015, we recognized a net actuarial loss of approximately $418 million compared to a net actuarial loss of approximately $918 million in 2014. Of the total net loss recognized in 2015, approximately $(245) million was related primarily to favorable changes in the discount rate and other assumptions and $666 million was related to asset losses and $(3) million was related to a discrete benefit resulting from certain events affecting our benefit programs. Of the $918 million net loss recognized in 2014, approximately $911 million was related to unfavorable changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions, and $41 million was related to asset losses, and $(34) million was related to a discrete benefit resulting from certain events affecting our benefit programs.\nDuring 2015, we made contributions in the amount of $19 million to Kellogg's global tax-qualified pension programs. This amount was mostly non-discretionary. Additionally we contributed $14 million to our retiree medical programs.\nIncome taxes\nOur consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment. Income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is expected to be remitted to and taxable in the United States.\nWe recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, new or emerging legislation and tax planning. The tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. Significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of Note 12 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED IN FUTURE PERIODS\nRecognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption can be elected for all financial statements of fiscal years and interim periods that have not yet been issued or that have not yet been made available for issuance. Entities should apply the update by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2018. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nBalance sheet classification of deferred taxes. In November 2015, the FASB issued an ASU to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The ASU requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Entities should apply the new guidance either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating when we will adopt the updated standard and whether to use the prospective or retrospective method. Our year-end 2015 balance for current deferred tax assets and liabilities was $227 and $9 million, respectively. Please see Note 12 for more information on our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nSimplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments. In September 2015, the FASB issued an ASU to simplify the accounting for measurement-period adjustments for items in a business combination. The ASU requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Entities should apply the new guidance prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the ASU with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. We will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nSimplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. In April 2015, the FASB issued an ASU to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. The ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Entities should apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis. We will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nCustomer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. In April 2015, the FASB issued an ASU to help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Entities should apply the new guidance either; 1) prospectively to all arrangements entered into or\nmaterially modified after the effective date or 2) retrospectively. We will adopt the updated standard prospectively in the first quarter of 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nRevenue from contracts with customers. In May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU which provides guidance for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of this ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity would be required to apply the following five steps: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. When the ASU was originally issued it was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption was not permitted. On July 9, 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. The updated standard will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Entities will be permitted to adopt the new revenue standard early, but not before the original effective date. Entities will have the option to apply the final standard retrospectively or use a modified retrospective method, recognizing the cumulative effect of the ASU in retained earnings at the date of initial application. An entity will not restate prior periods if it uses the modified retrospective method, but will be required to disclose the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period by the application of the ASU as compared to the guidance in effect prior to the change, as well as reasons for significant changes. We will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact that implementing this ASU will have on our financial statements and disclosures, as well as whether we will use the retrospective or modified retrospective method of adoption.\nFUTURE OUTLOOK\nWe expect during 2016 that Project K and zero-based budgeting savings will enable us to continue to invest in our businesses, our foods, and the categories in which we compete. We expect currency-neutral comparable net sales growth to be in the range of 1 to 3 percent. While our original 2016 guidance always included pricing to cover the impact of inflation in Venezuela, our latest outlook includes more pricing to offset inflation. While it is difficult to predict pricing actions that will be required in Venezuela, it is possible that currency-neutral comparable net sales growth could exceed our guidance range due to Venezuela.\nWe also expect currency-neutral comparable gross margin to be up slightly due to deflation resulting from material costs, savings from Project K and zero-based budgeting. This expectation for currency-neutral comparable gross margin excludes the impact of highly inflationary economies. Finally, we expect currency-neutral comparable operating profit growth in the range of 4 to 6 percent and currency-neutral comparable EPS to increase in the range of 6 to 8 percent.\nWe expect that full-year operating cash flow will be approximately $1.1 billion, including capital spending in the range of 4 to 5 percent of net sales. This capital spending expectation reflects much lower capital spending for Project K, but increased capital spending to support growth in our Pringles business.", "item_7_tables": "Table 41:

cereal, snacks, and convenience foods. Net sales in 2015 were $13.5 billion, down 7.2% vs 2014 mainly due to negative foreign currency translation and one less shipping week. \n\nResults of Operations\n- Comparable net sales increased 1.2% on a currency-neutral basis in 2015 driven by pricing actions in Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, comparable net sales declined 0.8%. \n- Currency-neutral comparable operating profit declined 2.3% in 2015, driven by resetting incentive compensation and a 3% decline excluding that. Gross margin declined 10 bps.\n- Cash flow as measured by operating cash flow less capex declined 6% in 2015 due to higher accounts receivable partially offset by a supplier financing initiative.\n\nRestructuring\n- Kellogg has undertaken Project K, a 4-year restructuring program expected to deliver $425-475M in annual savings by 2018. $180M of savings were achieved through 2015.\n\nOutlook\n- In 2016, Kellogg expects 1-3% currency-neutral comparable net sales growth and 4-6% currency-neutral comparable operating profit growth. Comparable EPS is expected to grow 6-8% on a currency-neutral basis.\n- Operating cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion in 2016 including capital expenditures of 4-5% of net sales."}
