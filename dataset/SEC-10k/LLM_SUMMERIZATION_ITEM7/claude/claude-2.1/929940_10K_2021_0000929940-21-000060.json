Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page 51. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations.\nOur fiscal year ends on June 30, and references to a specific fiscal year are the twelve months ended June 30 of such year (for example, \"fiscal 2021\" refers to the year ended June 30, 2021).\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBusiness Overview\nWe are a global leader in asset optimization software that optimizes asset design, operations and maintenance in complex, industrial environments. We combine decades of process modeling and operations expertise with big data, artificial intelligence, and advanced analytics. Our purpose-built software improves the competitiveness and profitability of our customers by: increasing throughput, energy efficiency, and production levels; reducing unplanned downtime, plant emissions, and safety risks; enhancing capital efficiency; and decreasing working capital requirements over the entire asset lifecycle to support operational excellence.\nOur software combines our proprietary mathematical and empirical models of manufacturing and planning processes which reflects the deep domain expertise we have amassed from focusing on solutions for the process and other capital-intensive industries for over 40 years. Our products have embedded AI capabilities that create insights, provide guidance, and automate and democratize knowledge, known as Industrial AI, to create more value for the process industries. We have developed our applications to design and optimize processes across three principal business areas: engineering, manufacturing and supply chain, and asset performance management. Each business area leverages our artificial intelligence of things products as the foundation of industrial data to help us realize our vision for Industrial AI at scale. We are the recognized market and technology leader in providing process optimization and asset performance management software for each of these business areas.\nWe have established sustainable competitive advantages based on the following strengths:\n\u2022Innovative products that can enhance our customers' profitability and productivity;\n\u2022Long-term customer relationships;\n\u2022Large installed base of users of our software; and\n\u2022Long-term license contracts.\nWe have approximately 2,500 customers globally. Our customers consist of companies engaged in the process and other capital-intensive industries such as energy, chemicals, engineering and construction, as well as pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, transportation, power, metals and mining, pulp and paper, and consumer packaged goods.\nBusiness Segments\nWe have two operating and reportable segments, which are consistent with our reporting units: (i) subscription and software and (ii) services and other. The subscription and software segment is engaged in the licensing of process optimization and asset performance management software solutions and associated support services, and includes our license and maintenance revenue. The services and other segment includes professional services and training, and includes our services and other revenue.\nRecent Events\nIn December 2019, the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and associated COVID 19 disease, or COVID-19, were reported in China, and in March 2020 the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. Since the beginning of March 2020, the sudden decrease in demand for oil due to the COVID-19 pandemic, compounded by the excess supply arising from producers' failure to agree on production cuts, resulted in a drop in oil prices. During fiscal 2021, our business was negatively impacted by these factors. Specifically, we saw a slowdown in closing customer contracts, a slight increase in our customer attrition rate due to non-renewals and renewals at lower entitlement level and, to a lesser extent, a slowdown in customer payments. We are continuing to assess the impact of these items on global markets and the various industries of our customers. The extent of the impact on our operational and financial performance going forward will depend on capital expenditure and operational expenditure budgetary cycles that are inherent in our customers' procurement strategies, which are informed by oil prices and environmental factors such as COVID-19, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. We are continuing to monitor the potential impacts related to the current disruption of COVID-19 and uncertainty in the global markets on the various industries of our customers. These factors could potentially impact the signing of new agreements, as well as the recoverability of assets, including accounts receivable and contract costs.\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn June 14, 2021, as part of our common stock repurchase program, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program, or the ASR Program, with a third-party financial institution. Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Program, on July 1, 2021 we made an upfront payment of $150.0 million in exchange for an initial delivery of approximately 872,473 shares of our common stock, representing 80% of the total shares ultimately expected to be delivered over the program's term.\nAt the ASR Program's conclusion, the financial institution may be required to deliver additional shares of common stock to us, or, under certain circumstances, we may be required to, at our election, deliver shares of our common stock or make a cash payment to the financial institution. Final settlement of the ASR Program is expected to occur during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, with the number of shares to be delivered, or the amount of any cash payment to be made, determined based on the volume-weighted average price per share of our common stock over the term of the ASR Program, less an agreed-upon discount.\nKey Components of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue primarily from the following sources:\nLicense Revenue. We sell our software products to end users, primarily under fixed-term licenses, through a subscription offering which we refer to as our aspenONE licensing model. The aspenONE licensing model includes software maintenance and support, known as our Premier Plus SMS offering, for the entire term. Our aspenONE products are organized into three suites: 1) engineering; 2) manufacturing and supply chain; and 3) asset performance management. Each product suite leverages our AIoT products as the foundation of industrial data. Our APM product suite is licensed by customer sites, user seats or cloud connections. The engineering and manufacturing and supply chain product suites are licensed by tokens, which are interchangeable measures of usage based on the various units of measure such as users, servers, applications, manipulated variables, etc. Customers may use tokens flexibly to access one or more products in the suite in any combination. This licensing system enables customers to use products as needed, and to experiment with different products to best solve whatever critical business challenges the customer faces, and to license additional tokens as business needs evolve.\nWe also license our software through point product arrangements with our Premier Plus SMS offering included for the contract term.\nMaintenance Revenue. We provide customers technical support, access to software fixes and updates and the right to any new unspecified future software products and updates that may be introduced into the licensed aspenONE software suite. Our technical support services are provided from our customer support centers throughout the world, as well as via email and through our support website.\nServices and Other Revenue. We provide training and professional services to our customers. Our professional services are focused on implementing our technology in order to improve customers' plant performance and gain better operational data. Customers who use our professional services typically engage us to provide those services over periods of up to 24 months. We charge customers for professional services on a time-and-materials or fixed-price basis. We provide training services to our customers, including on-site, Internet-based and customized training.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of License. Our cost of license revenue consists of (i) royalties, (ii) amortization of capitalized software and intangible assets, and (iii) distribution fees.\nCost of Maintenance. Our cost of maintenance revenue consists primarily of personnel-related costs of providing Premier Plus SMS bundled with our aspenONE licensing and point product arrangements.\nCost of Services and Other. Our cost of services and other revenue consists primarily of personnel-related and external consultant costs associated with providing our customers professional services and training.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling and Marketing Expenses. Selling expenses consist primarily of the personnel and travel expenses related to the effort expended to license our products and services to current and potential customers, as well as for overall management of customer relationships. Marketing expenses include expenses needed to promote our company and our products and to conduct market research to help us better understand our customers and their business needs.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses related to the creation of new software products, enhancements and engineering changes to existing products.\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses include the personnel expenses of corporate and support functions, such as executive leadership and administration groups, finance, legal, human resources and corporate communications, and other costs, such as outside professional and consultant fees, amortization of intangible assets, and the provision for bad debt on accounts receivable.\nOther Income and Expenses\nInterest Income. Interest income is recorded for financing components under Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) or Topic 606. When a contract includes a significant financing component, we generally receive the majority of the customer consideration after the recognition of a substantial portion of the arrangement fee as license revenue. As a result, we decrease the amount of revenue recognized and increase interest income by a corresponding amount.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense is primarily related to outstanding borrowings under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net. Other (expense) income, net is comprised primarily of foreign currency exchange gains (losses) generated from the settlement and remeasurement of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our entities.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes is comprised of domestic and foreign taxes. We record interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events, such as tax benefits from the disposition of employee equity awards, settlements of tax audits and assessments and tax law changes. Our effective income tax rate is also impacted by, and may fluctuate in any given period because of, the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ.\nKey Business Metrics\nBackground\nWe utilize key business measures to track and assess the performance of our business. We have identified the following set of appropriate business metrics in the context of our evolving business:\n\u2022Annual spend\n\u2022Total contract value\n\u2022Bookings\nWe also use the following non-GAAP business metrics in addition to GAAP measures to track our business performance:\n\u2022Free cash flow\n\u2022Non-GAAP operating income\nWe make these measures available to investors and none of these metrics should be considered as an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nAnnual Spend\nAnnual spend is an estimate of the annualized value of our portfolio of term license agreements, as of a specific date. Annual spend is calculated by summing the most recent annual invoice value of each of our active term license agreements. Annual spend also includes the annualized value of standalone SMS agreements purchased with certain legacy term license agreements, which have become an immaterial part of our business.\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparing annual spend for different dates can provide insight into the growth and retention rates of our business, because annual spend represents the estimated annualized billings associated with our active term license agreements. Management utilizes the annual spend business metric to evaluate the growth and performance of our business as well as for planning and forecasting. In addition, our corporate and executive bonus programs are based in part on our success in meeting targets for growth in annual spend that are approved by our Board of Directors. We believe that annual spend is a useful business metric to investors as it provides insight into the growth component of our term licenses and to how management evaluates and forecasts the results of the business.\nAnnual spend increases as a result of new term license agreements with new or existing customers, renewals or modifications of existing term license agreements that result in higher license fees due to contractually-agreed price escalation or an increase in the number of tokens (units of software usage) or products licensed, and escalation of annual payments in our active term license agreements.\nAnnual spend is adversely affected by term license and standalone SMS agreements that are renewed at a lower entitlement level or not renewed and, to a lesser extent, by customer agreements that become inactive during the agreement's term because, in our determination, amounts due (or which will become due) under the agreement are not collectible. Because the annual spend calculation includes all of our active term license agreements, the reported balance may include agreements with customers that are delinquent in paying invoices, that are in bankruptcy proceedings, or where payment is otherwise in doubt.\nAs of June 30, 2021, approximately 90% of our term license agreements (by value) are denominated in U.S. dollars. For agreements denominated in other currencies, we use a fixed historical exchange rate to calculate annual spend in dollars rather than using current exchange rates, so that our calculation of growth in annual spend is not affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies.\nBeginning in fiscal 2019 and for all future periods, for term license agreements that contain professional services or other products and services, we have included in the annual spend calculation the portion of the invoice allocable to the term license under Topic 606 rather than the portion of the invoice attributed to the license in the agreement. We believe that methodology more accurately allocates any discounts or premiums to the different elements of the agreement. We have not applied this methodology retroactively for agreements entered into in prior fiscal years.\nWe estimate that annual spend grew by approximately 4.8% during fiscal 2021, from $593.1 million as of June 30, 2020 to $621.3 million as of June 30, 2021. We estimate that annual spend grew by approximately 9.6% during fiscal 2020, from $541.0 million as of June 30, 2019 to $593.1 million as of June 30, 2020.\nTotal Contract Value\nTotal Contract Value (\"TCV\") is the aggregate value of all payments received or to be received under all active term license agreements, including maintenance and escalation. TCV was $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nBookings\nBookings is the total value of customer term license contracts signed in the current period, less the value of such contracts signed in the current period where the initial licenses are not yet deemed delivered, plus term license contracts signed in a previous period for which the initial licenses are deemed delivered in the current period.\nBookings was $774.5 million during fiscal 2021, compared to $610.1 million and $651.8 million during fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change in bookings during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 is related to the timing of renewals.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe use a non-GAAP measure of free cash flow to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. Management believes that this financial measure is useful to investors because it permits investors to view our performance using the same tools that management uses to gauge progress in achieving our goals. We believe this measure is also useful to investors because it is an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund investments in future growth initiatives or to repay borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and it is a basis for comparing our performance with that of our competitors. The presentation of free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFree cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for the net impact of (a) purchases of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, (b) payments for capitalized computer software costs, and (c) other nonrecurring items, such as acquisition related payments.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP cash flow from operating activities to free cash flow for the indicated periods:\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>June 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>276,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>243,258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238,313 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase of property, equipment, and leasehold improvements </td> <td>(1,237) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,278) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(436) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments for capitalized computer software costs </td> <td>(1,129) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(141) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,131) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition related payments </td> <td>3,733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow (non-GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>277,501 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>243,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>236,773 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nTotal free cash flow increased $34.4 million during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to changes in working capital. For a more detailed description of these changes refer to \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nTotal free cash flow increased $6.3 million during fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to changes in working capital. For a more detailed description of these changes refer to \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nNon-GAAP Income from Operations\nNon-GAAP income from operations excludes certain non-cash and non-recurring expenses, and is used as a supplement to income from operations presented on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP income from operations is a useful financial measure because removing certain non-cash and other items provides additional insight into recurring profitability and cash flow from operations.\nThe following table presents our income from operations, as adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and other items, such as the impact of acquisition related fees, for the indicated periods:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Prior to the maturity of the revolving credit facility under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, any amounts borrowed under the facility may be repaid and, subject to the terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, borrowed again in whole or in part without penalty.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we paid off the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility of $119.2 million. As of June 30, 2021, our current borrowings of $20.0 million consist of the term loan facility. Our non-current borrowings of $273.2 million consist of $276.0 million of our term loan facility, net of $2.8 million in debt issuance costs. We had current borrowings of $135.2 million and non-current borrowings of $292.4 million as of June 30, 2020.\nFor a more detailed description of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, refer to Note 12, \"Credit Agreement,\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash Equivalents and Cash Flows\nOur cash equivalents of $1.0 million as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, consisted of money market funds. The objective of our investment policy is to manage our cash and investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated:\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended June 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>276,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>243,258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238,313 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td>(19,781) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(76,203) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,665) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td>(165,134) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(254,527) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(620) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(360) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>215,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24,239) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur primary source of cash is from the annual installments associated with our software license arrangements and related software support services, and to a lesser extent from professional services and training. We believe that cash inflows from our term license business will grow as we benefit from the continued growth of our portfolio of term license contracts.\nFiscal 2021\nCash from operating activities provided $276.1 million during fiscal 2021. This amount resulted from net income of $319.8 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $79.1 million, and net uses of cash of $(122.8) million related to changes in working capital.\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-cash items within net income consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $33.6 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $10.3 million, provision for bad debts of $9.7 million, reduction in the carrying amount of right-of-use assets of $8.9 million, deferred income taxes of $12.3 million, and net foreign currency losses of $3.4 million.\nCash used by working capital of $(122.8) million in fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in contract assets of $113.7 million, increases in prepaid expenses, prepaid income taxes, and other assets of $12.8 million, decreases in lease liabilities of $10.2 million, increases in accounts receivable of $2.1 million, and increases in contract costs of $0.4 million, partially offset by cash provided by increases in deferred revenue of $16.6 million.\nFiscal 2020\nCash from operating activities provided $243.3 million during fiscal 2020. This amount resulted from net income of $229.7 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $83.2 million, and net uses of cash of $(69.6) million related to changes in working capital.\nNon-cash items within net income consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $31.5 million, deferred income taxes of $28.1 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $9.6 million, reduction in the carrying amount of right-of-use assets of $9.1 million, provision for bad debts of $5.3 million, and net foreign currency gains of $(0.9) million.\nCash used by working capital of $(69.6) million was primarily attributable to cash used by increases in contract assets of $28.1 million, decreases in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $23.4 million, increases in accounts receivable of $12.9 million, decreases in lease liabilities of $9.5 million, increases in prepaid expenses, prepaid income taxes, and other assets of $5.3 million, and increases in contract costs of $3.6 million, partially offset by cash provided by increases in deferred revenue of $13.0 million.\nFiscal 2019\nCash from operating activities provided $238.3 million during fiscal 2019. This amount resulted from net income of $261.4 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $8.4 million, and net sources of cash of $(31.5) million related to changes in working capital.\nNon-cash items within net income consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $27.6 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $8.1 million, deferred income taxes of $(27.1) million, provision for bad debts of $0.6 million, and net foreign currency gains of $(1.3) million.\nCash used by working capital of $(31.5) million was primarily attributable to cash used by increases in contract assets of $57.7 million, increases in accounts receivable of $6.6 million, increases in contract costs of $4.5 million, and increases in prepaid expenses, prepaid income taxes, and other assets of $2.4 million, partially offset by cash provided by increases in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $21.9 million, and increases in deferred revenue of $17.8 million. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities is primarily due to an increase in income taxes payable as of June 30, 2019 from the tax liability associated with adopting Topic 606. There was a correlating decrease in deferred income taxes during fiscal 2019.\nInvesting Activities\nFiscal 2021\nDuring fiscal 2021, we used $19.8 million of cash from investing activities. We used $16.3 million for business acquisitions, $1.2 million for capital expenditures, $1.1 million for equity method investments, and $1.1 million for capitalized computer software development costs.\nFiscal 2020\nDuring fiscal 2020, we used $76.2 million of cash from investing activities. We used $74.5 million for business acquisitions, $1.3 million for capital expenditures, $0.3 million for equity method investments, and $0.1 million for capitalized computer software development costs.\nFiscal 2019\nDuring fiscal 2019, we used $7.7 million of cash from investing activities. We used $6.1 million for business acquisitions,$1.1 million for capitalized computer software development costs, and $0.4 million for capital expenditures.\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing Activities\nFiscal 2021\nDuring fiscal 2021, we used $165.1 million of cash from financing activities.

We estimate that none of this amount will be paid within the next year and we are currently unable to reasonably estimate the timing of payments for the remainder of the liability.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of June 30, 2021, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Judgments\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nFor further information on our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies,\" and Note 3, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn accordance with Topic 606, we account for a customer contract when both parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations, each party's rights can be identified, payment terms can be identified, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable that we will collect substantially all of the consideration to which we are entitled. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer.\nNature of Products and Services\nWe generate revenue from the following sources: (1) License revenue; (2) Maintenance revenue; and (3) Services and other revenue. We sell our software products to end users primarily under fixed-term licenses. We license our software products primarily through a subscription offering which we refer to as our aspenONE licensing model, which includes software maintenance and support, known as our Premier Plus SMS offering, for the entire term. Our aspenONE products are organized into three suites: 1) engineering; 2) manufacturing and supply chain; and 3) asset performance management. Each product suite leverages our AIoT products as the foundation of industrial data. Our APM product suite is licensed by customer sites, user seats or cloud connections. The engineering and manufacturing and supply chain product suites are licensed by tokens, which are interchangeable measures of usage based on the various units of measure such as users, servers, applications, manipulated variables, etc. Customers may use tokens flexibly to access any product or combination of products in the licensed suite.\nWe also license our software through point product term arrangements, which include our Premier Plus SMS offering for the entire term.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022 Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022 Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022 Determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022 Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022 Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nTerm-based Arrangements: Term-based arrangements consist of on-premise term licenses as well as maintenance.\nLicense\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLicense revenue consists primarily of product and related revenue from our aspenONE licensing model and point product arrangements.\nWhen a customer elects to license our products under our aspenONE licensing model, the customer receives, for the term of the arrangement, the right to all software products in the licensed aspenONE software suite. When a customer elects to license point products, the customer receives, for the term of the arrangement, the right to license specified products in the licensed aspenONE software suite. Revenue from initial product licenses is recognized upfront upon delivery.\nMaintenance\nWhen a customer elects to license our products under our aspenONE licensing model, our Premier Plus SMS offering is included for the entire term of the arrangement and the customer receives, for the term of the arrangement, the right to any updates that may be introduced into the licensed aspenONE software suite. When a customer elects to license point products, our Premier Plus SMS offering is included for the entire term of the arrangement and the customer receives, for the term of the arrangement, the right to any updates that may be introduced related to the specified products licensed. Maintenance represents a stand-ready obligation and, due to our obligation to provide unspecified future software updates on a when-and-if available basis as well as telephone support services, we are required to recognize revenue ratably over the term of the arrangement.\nServices and Other Revenue\nProfessional Services Revenue\nProfessional services are provided to customers on a T&M or fixed-price basis. The obligation to provide professional services is generally satisfied over time, with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits as we satisfy our performance obligation. For professional services, revenue is recognized by measuring progress toward the completion of our obligations. We recognize professional services fees for our T&M contracts based upon hours worked and contractually agreed-upon hourly rates. Revenue from fixed-price engagements is recognized using the proportional performance method based on the ratio of costs incurred to the total estimated project costs. The use of the proportional performance method is dependent upon our ability to reliably estimate the costs to complete a project. We use historical experience as a basis for future estimates to complete current projects. Additionally, we believe that costs are the best available measure of performance. Out-of-pocket expenses which are reimbursed by customers are recorded as revenue.\nTraining Revenue\nWe provide training services to our customers, including on-site, Internet-based, public and customized training. The obligation to provide training services is generally satisfied over time, with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits as we satisfy our performance obligation. Revenue is recognized in the period in which the services are performed.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts generally contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation.\nAllocation of consideration: We allocate total contract consideration to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it was sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers.\nIf the arrangement contains professional services and other products or services, we allocate to the professional service obligation a portion of the total contract consideration based on the standalone selling price of professional services that is observed from consistently priced standalone sales.\nThe standalone selling price for term licenses, which are always sold with maintenance, is the price for the combined license and maintenance bundle. The amount assigned to the license and maintenance bundle is separated into license and maintenance amounts using the respective standalone selling prices represented by the value relationship between the software license and maintenance.\nWhen two or more contracts are entered into at or near the same time with the same customer, we evaluate the facts and circumstances associated with the negotiation of those contracts. Where the contracts are negotiated as a package, we will\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\naccount for them as a single arrangement and allocate the consideration for the combined contracts among the performance obligations accordingly.\nStandalone selling price: When available, we use directly observable transactions to determine the standalone selling prices for performance obligations. Generally, directly observable data is not available for term licenses and maintenance. When term licenses are sold together with maintenance in a bundled arrangement, we estimate a standalone selling price for these distinct performance obligations using relevant information, including our overall pricing objectives and strategies and historical pricing data, and taking into consideration market conditions and other factors.\nOther policies and judgments\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment annually over the term of the license arrangement. Therefore, we generally receive payment from a customer after the performance obligation related to the license has been satisfied, and therefore, our contracts generally contain a significant financing component. The significant financing component is calculated utilizing an interest rate that derives the net present value of the performance obligations delivered on an upfront basis based on the allocation of consideration. We have instituted a customer portfolio approach in assigning interest rates. The rates are determined at contract inception and are based on the credit characteristics of the customers within each portfolio.\nContract modifications\nWe sometimes enter into agreements to modify previously executed contracts, which constitute contract modifications. We assess each of these contract modifications to determine (i) if the additional products and services are distinct from the products and services in the original arrangement; and (ii) if the amount of consideration expected for the added products and services reflects the stand-alone selling price of those products and services, as adjusted for contract-specific circumstances. A contract modification meeting both criteria is accounted for as a separate contract. A contract modification not meeting both criteria is considered a change to the original contract and is accounted for on either (i) a prospective basis as a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract\u037e or (ii) a cumulative catch-up basis. Generally, our contract modifications meet both criteria and are accounted for as a separate contract, as adjusted for contract-specific circumstances.\nContract Costs\nWe pay commissions for new product sales as well as for renewals of existing contracts. Commissions paid to obtain renewal contracts are not commensurate with the commissions paid for new product sales and therefore, a portion of the commissions paid for new contracts relate to future renewals.\nWe account for new product sales commissions using a portfolio approach and allocate the cost of commissions in proportion to the allocation of transaction price of license and maintenance performance obligations, including assumed renewals. Commissions allocated to the license and license renewal components are expensed at the time the license revenue is recognized. Commissions allocated to maintenance are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of four to eight years for new contracts, reflecting our estimate of the expected period that we will benefit from those commissions.\nAmortization of capitalized contract costs is included in sales and marketing expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 (o) \"New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal 2021\" and Note 2 (p) \"Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements,\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information about recent accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page 51.

Each business area leverages our artificial intelligence of things products as the foundation of industrial data to help us realize our vision for Industrial AI at scale. We are the recognized market and technology leader in providing process optimization and asset performance management software for each of these business areas.\nWe have established sustainable competitive advantages based on the following strengths:\n\u2022Innovative products that can enhance our customers' profitability and productivity;\n\u2022Long-term customer relationships;\n\u2022Large installed base of users of our software; and\n\u2022Long-term license contracts.\nWe have approximately 2,500 customers globally. Our customers consist of companies engaged in the process and other capital-intensive industries such as energy, chemicals, engineering and construction, as well as pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, transportation, power, metals and mining, pulp and paper, and consumer packaged goods.\nBusiness Segments\nWe have two operating and reportable segments, which are consistent with our reporting units: (i) subscription and software and (ii) services and other. The subscription and software segment is engaged in the licensing of process optimization and asset performance management software solutions and associated support services, and includes our license and maintenance revenue. The services and other segment includes professional services and training, and includes our services and other revenue.\nRecent Events\nIn December 2019, the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and associated COVID 19 disease, or COVID-19, were reported in China, and in March 2020 the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. Since the beginning of March 2020, the sudden decrease in demand for oil due to the COVID-19 pandemic, compounded by the excess supply arising from producers' failure to agree on production cuts, resulted in a drop in oil prices. During fiscal 2021, our business was negatively impacted by these factors. Specifically, we saw a slowdown in closing customer contracts, a slight increase in our customer attrition rate due to non-renewals and renewals at lower entitlement level and, to a lesser extent, a slowdown in customer payments. We are continuing to assess the impact of these items on global markets and the various industries of our customers. The extent of the impact on our operational and financial performance going forward will depend on capital expenditure and operational expenditure budgetary cycles that are inherent in our customers' procurement strategies, which are informed by oil prices and environmental factors such as COVID-19, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. We are continuing to monitor the potential impacts related to the current disruption of COVID-19 and uncertainty in the global markets on the various industries of our customers. These factors could potentially impact the signing of new agreements, as well as the recoverability of assets, including accounts receivable and contract costs.\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn June 14, 2021, as part of our common stock repurchase program, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program, or the ASR Program, with a third-party financial institution. Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Program, on July 1, 2021 we made an upfront payment of $150.0 million in exchange for an initial delivery of approximately 872,473 shares of our common stock, representing 80% of the total shares ultimately expected to be delivered over the program's term.\nAt the ASR Program's conclusion, the financial institution may be required to deliver additional shares of common stock to us, or, under certain circumstances, we may be required to, at our election, deliver shares of our common stock or make a cash payment to the financial institution. Final settlement of the ASR Program is expected to occur during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, with the number of shares to be delivered, or the amount of any cash payment to be made, determined based on the volume-weighted average price per share of our common stock over the term of the ASR Program, less an agreed-upon discount.\nKey Components of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue primarily from the following sources:\nLicense Revenue. We sell our software products to end users, primarily under fixed-term licenses, through a subscription offering which we refer to as our aspenONE licensing model. The aspenONE licensing model includes software maintenance and support, known as our Premier Plus SMS offering, for the entire term. Our aspenONE products are organized into three suites: 1) engineering; 2) manufacturing and supply chain; and 3) asset performance management. Each product suite leverages our AIoT products as the foundation of industrial data. Our APM product suite is licensed by customer sites, user seats or cloud connections. The engineering and manufacturing and supply chain product suites are licensed by tokens, which are interchangeable measures of usage based on the various units of measure such as users, servers, applications, manipulated variables, etc. Customers may use tokens flexibly to access one or more products in the suite in any combination. This licensing system enables customers to use products as needed, and to experiment with different products to best solve whatever critical business challenges the customer faces, and to license additional tokens as business needs evolve.\nWe also license our software through point product arrangements with our Premier Plus SMS offering included for the contract term.\nMaintenance Revenue. We provide customers technical support, access to software fixes and updates and the right to any new unspecified future software products and updates that may be introduced into the licensed aspenONE software suite. Our technical support services are provided from our customer support centers throughout the world, as well as via email and through our support website.\nServices and Other Revenue. We provide training and professional services to our customers. Our professional services are focused on implementing our technology in order to improve customers' plant performance and gain better operational data. Customers who use our professional services typically engage us to provide those services over periods of up to 24 months. We charge customers for professional services on a time-and-materials or fixed-price basis. We provide training services to our customers, including on-site, Internet-based and customized training.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of License. Our cost of license revenue consists of (i) royalties, (ii) amortization of capitalized software and intangible assets, and (iii) distribution fees.\nCost of Maintenance. Our cost of maintenance revenue consists primarily of personnel-related costs of providing Premier Plus SMS bundled with our aspenONE licensing and point product arrangements.\nCost of Services and Other. Our cost of services and other revenue consists primarily of personnel-related and external consultant costs associated with providing our customers professional services and training.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling and Marketing Expenses. Selling expenses consist primarily of the personnel and travel expenses related to the effort expended to license our products and services to current and potential customers, as well as for overall management of customer relationships. Marketing expenses include expenses needed to promote our company and our products and to conduct market research to help us better understand our customers and their business needs.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses related to the creation of new software products, enhancements and engineering changes to existing products.\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses include the personnel expenses of corporate and support functions, such as executive leadership and administration groups, finance, legal, human resources and corporate communications, and other costs, such as outside professional and consultant fees, amortization of intangible assets, and the provision for bad debt on accounts receivable.\nOther Income and Expenses\nInterest Income. Interest income is recorded for financing components under Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) or Topic 606. When a contract includes a significant financing component, we generally receive the majority of the customer consideration after the recognition of a substantial portion of the arrangement fee as license revenue. As a result, we decrease the amount of revenue recognized and increase interest income by a corresponding amount.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense is primarily related to outstanding borrowings under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net. Other (expense) income, net is comprised primarily of foreign currency exchange gains (losses) generated from the settlement and remeasurement of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our entities.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes is comprised of domestic and foreign taxes. We record interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events, such as tax benefits from the disposition of employee equity awards, settlements of tax audits and assessments and tax law changes. Our effective income tax rate is also impacted by, and may fluctuate in any given period because of, the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ.\nKey Business Metrics\nBackground\nWe utilize key business measures to track and assess the performance of our business. We have identified the following set of appropriate business metrics in the context of our evolving business:\n\u2022Annual spend\n\u2022Total contract value\n\u2022Bookings\nWe also use the following non-GAAP business metrics in addition to GAAP measures to track our business performance:\n\u2022Free cash flow\n\u2022Non-GAAP operating income\nWe make these measures available to investors and none of these metrics should be considered as an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nAnnual Spend\nAnnual spend is an estimate of the annualized value of our portfolio of term license agreements, as of a specific date. Annual spend is calculated by summing the most recent annual invoice value of each of our active term license agreements. Annual spend also includes the annualized value of standalone SMS agreements purchased with certain legacy term license agreements, which have become an immaterial part of our business.\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparing annual spend for different dates can provide insight into the growth and retention rates of our business, because annual spend represents the estimated annualized billings associated with our active term license agreements. Management utilizes the annual spend business metric to evaluate the growth and performance of our business as well as for planning and forecasting. In addition, our corporate and executive bonus programs are based in part on our success in meeting targets for growth in annual spend that are approved by our Board of Directors. We believe that annual spend is a useful business metric to investors as it provides insight into the growth component of our term licenses and to how management evaluates and forecasts the results of the business.\nAnnual spend increases as a result of new term license agreements with new or existing customers, renewals or modifications of existing term license agreements that result in higher license fees due to contractually-agreed price escalation or an increase in the number of tokens (units of software usage) or products licensed, and escalation of annual payments in our active term license agreements.\nAnnual spend is adversely affected by term license and standalone SMS agreements that are renewed at a lower entitlement level or not renewed and, to a lesser extent, by customer agreements that become inactive during the agreement's term because, in our determination, amounts due (or which will become due) under the agreement are not collectible. Because the annual spend calculation includes all of our active term license agreements, the reported balance may include agreements with customers that are delinquent in paying invoices, that are in bankruptcy proceedings, or where payment is otherwise in doubt.\nAs of June 30, 2021, approximately 90% of our term license agreements (by value) are denominated in U.S. dollars. For agreements denominated in other currencies, we use a fixed historical exchange rate to calculate annual spend in dollars rather than using current exchange rates, so that our calculation of growth in annual spend is not affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies.\nBeginning in fiscal 2019 and for all future periods, for term license agreements that contain professional services or other products and services, we have included in the annual spend calculation the portion of the invoice allocable to the term license under Topic 606 rather than the portion of the invoice attributed to the license in the agreement. We believe that methodology more accurately allocates any discounts or premiums to the different elements of the agreement. We have not applied this methodology retroactively for agreements entered into in prior fiscal years.\nWe estimate that annual spend grew by approximately 4.8% during fiscal 2021, from $593.1 million as of June 30, 2020 to $621.3 million as of June 30, 2021. We estimate that annual spend grew by approximately 9.6% during fiscal 2020, from $541.0 million as of June 30, 2019 to $593.1 million as of June 30, 2020.\nTotal Contract Value\nTotal Contract Value (\"TCV\") is the aggregate value of all payments received or to be received under all active term license agreements, including maintenance and escalation. TCV was $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nBookings\nBookings is the total value of customer term license contracts signed in the current period, less the value of such contracts signed in the current period where the initial licenses are not yet deemed delivered, plus term license contracts signed in a previous period for which the initial licenses are deemed delivered in the current period.\nBookings was $774.5 million during fiscal 2021, compared to $610.1 million and $651.8 million during fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change in bookings during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 is related to the timing of renewals.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe use a non-GAAP measure of free cash flow to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. Management believes that this financial measure is useful to investors because it permits investors to view our performance using the same tools that management uses to gauge progress in achieving our goals. We believe this measure is also useful to investors because it is an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund investments in future growth initiatives or to repay borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and it is a basis for comparing our performance with that of our competitors. The presentation of free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFree cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for the net impact of (a) purchases of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, (b) payments for capitalized computer software costs, and (c) other nonrecurring items, such as acquisition related payments.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP cash flow from operating activities to free cash flow for the indicated periods:\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>June 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>276,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>243,258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238,313 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase of property, equipment, and leasehold improvements </td> <td>(1,237) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,278) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(436) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments for capitalized computer software costs </td> <td>(1,129) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(141) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,131) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition related payments </td> <td>3,733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow (non-GAAP) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>277,501 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>243,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>236,773 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nTotal free cash flow increased $34.4 million during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to changes in working capital. For a more detailed description of these changes refer to \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nTotal free cash flow increased $6.3 million during fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to changes in working capital. For a more detailed description of these changes refer to \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nNon-GAAP Income from Operations\nNon-GAAP income from operations excludes certain non-cash and non-recurring expenses, and is used as a supplement to income from operations presented on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP income from operations is a useful financial measure because removing certain non-cash and other items provides additional insight into recurring profitability and cash flow from operations.\nThe following table presents our income from operations, as adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and other items, such as the impact of acquisition related fees, for the indicated periods:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

We may need to raise additional funds if we decide to make one or more acquisitions of businesses, technologies or products. If additional funding for such purposes is required beyond existing resources and our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement described below, we may not be able to effect a receivable, equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nCredit Agreement\nIn December 2019, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner, Silicon Valley Bank, as joint lead arranger, joint bookrunner and syndication agent, and the lenders and co-documentation agents named therein (the \"Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\"). The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which amends and restates the prior Credit Agreement we entered into as of February 26, 2016 with the same lenders (the Prior Credit Agreement\u201d), provides for a $200.0 million secured revolving credit facility and a $320.0 million secured term loan facility. The indebtedness under the revolving credit facility matures on December 23, 2024. Prior to the maturity of the revolving credit facility under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, any amounts borrowed under the facility may be repaid and, subject to the terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, borrowed again in whole or in part without penalty.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we paid off the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility of $119.2 million. As of June 30, 2021, our current borrowings of $20.0 million consist of the term loan facility. Our non-current borrowings of $273.2 million consist of $276.0 million of our term loan facility, net of $2.8 million in debt issuance costs.

The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities is primarily due to an increase in income taxes payable as of June 30, 2019 from the tax liability associated with adopting Topic 606. There was a correlating decrease in deferred income taxes during fiscal 2019.\nInvesting Activities\nFiscal 2021\nDuring fiscal 2021, we used $19.8 million of cash from investing activities. We used $16.3 million for business acquisitions, $1.2 million for capital expenditures, $1.1 million for equity method investments, and $1.1 million for capitalized computer software development costs.\nFiscal 2020\nDuring fiscal 2020, we used $76.2 million of cash from investing activities. We used $74.5 million for business acquisitions, $1.3 million for capital expenditures, $0.3 million for equity method investments, and $0.1 million for capitalized computer software development costs.\nFiscal 2019\nDuring fiscal 2019, we used $7.7 million of cash from investing activities. We used $6.1 million for business acquisitions,$1.1 million for capitalized computer software development costs, and $0.4 million for capital expenditures.\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing Activities\nFiscal 2021\nDuring fiscal 2021, we used $165.1 million of cash from financing activities. Uses of cash in the period included the repayment of the outstanding revolving line of credit of $119.2 million, $45.6 million for repurchases of our common stock, $16.0 million for repayments of the term loan, $9.2 million for withholding taxes on vested and settled restricted stock units, and $1.2 million for deferred business acquisition payments, partially offset by proceeds of $26.1 million from the exercise of employee stock options.\nFiscal 2020\nDuring fiscal 2020, $49.4 million of net cash was provided by financing activities. Sources of cash in the period included proceeds of $449.2 million from the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, $125.0 million from the Prior Credit Agreement, and proceeds of $9.0 million from the exercise of employee stock options, partially offset by uses of cash of $152.4 million for repurchases of our common stock, $10.2 million for withholding taxes on vested and settled restricted stock units, $345.0 million for repayments of the revolving line of credit from the Prior Credit Agreement, $10.0 million for repayments of the revolving line of credit and $8.0 million for repayments of the term loan from the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and $4.6 million for deferred business acquisition payments, and $3.5 million for debit issuance costs.\nFiscal 2019\nDuring fiscal 2019, we used $254.5 million of cash for financing activities. We used $299.2 million for repurchases of our common stock, $1.7 million for deferred business acquisition payments, and $14.5 million for withholding taxes on vested and settled restricted stock units. Sources of cash in the period included proceeds of $50.0 million from the Prior Credit Agreement and proceeds of $10.9 million from the exercise of employee stock options.\nContractual Obligations and Requirements\nOur contractual obligations, which consisted of borrowings, interest, and fees under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, operating lease commitments for our headquarters and other facilities, royalty obligations, equity method investments, deferred acquisition payments, and standby letters of credit and other obligations, were as follows as of June 30, 2021:\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 to 3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3 to 5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Cash Obligations: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit agreement (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>314,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,091 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>215,830 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (2)\n</td> <td>62,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,718 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,061 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty obligations </td> <td>4,299 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>307 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity method investments </td> <td>4,093 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,093 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred acquisition payments </td> <td>4,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other purchase obligations </td> <td>18,824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,598 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>407,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>98,394 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>227,319 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,368 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Commercial Commitments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,544 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial commitments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>410,058 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>98,394 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>228,863 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,368 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________________\n(1)The $314.1 million of contractual obligations related to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement includes $296.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our term loan facility, and $18.1 million of interest expense and commitment fees as of June 30, 2021.\n(2)The $62.4 million of contractual obligations includes rent and fixed fees for all of our operating leases, including those not recognized on the balance sheet.\nWe are not currently a party to any other material purchase contracts related to future capital expenditures, and we do not expect our future investment in capital expenditures to be materially different from recent levels.\nThe standby letters of credit were issued by Silicon Valley Bank in the United States and secure our performance on professional services contracts and certain facility leases.\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above table does not reflect a liability for uncertain tax positions of $2.1 million as of June 30, 2021. We estimate that none of this amount will be paid within the next year and we are currently unable to reasonably estimate the timing of payments for the remainder of the liability.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of June 30, 2021, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Judgments\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nFor further information on our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies,\" and Note 3, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn accordance with Topic 606, we account for a customer contract when both parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations, each party's rights can be identified, payment terms can be identified, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable that we will collect substantially all of the consideration to which we are entitled. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer.\nNature of Products and Services\nWe generate revenue from the following sources: (1) License revenue; (2) Maintenance revenue; and (3) Services and other revenue. We sell our software products to end users primarily under fixed-term licenses. We license our software products primarily through a subscription offering which we refer to as our aspenONE licensing model, which includes software maintenance and support, known as our Premier Plus SMS offering, for the entire term. Our aspenONE products are organized into three suites: 1) engineering; 2) manufacturing and supply chain; and 3) asset performance management. Each product suite leverages our AIoT products as the foundation of industrial data. Our APM product suite is licensed by customer sites, user seats or cloud connections. The engineering and manufacturing and supply chain product suites are licensed by tokens, which are interchangeable measures of usage based on the various units of measure such as users, servers, applications, manipulated variables, etc. Customers may use tokens flexibly to access any product or combination of products in the licensed suite.\nWe also license our software through point product term arrangements, which include our Premier Plus SMS offering for the entire term.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022 Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022 Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022 Determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022 Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022 Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nTerm-based Arrangements: Term-based arrangements consist of on-premise term licenses as well as maintenance.\nLicense\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLicense revenue consists primarily of product and related revenue from our aspenONE licensing model and point product arrangements.\nWhen a customer elects to license our products under our aspenONE licensing model, the customer receives, for the term of the arrangement, the right to all software products in the licensed aspenONE software suite. When a customer elects to license point products, the customer receives, for the term of the arrangement, the right to license specified products in the licensed aspenONE software suite. Revenue from initial product licenses is recognized upfront upon delivery.\nMaintenance\nWhen a customer elects to license our products under our aspenONE licensing model, our Premier Plus SMS offering is included for the entire term of the arrangement and the customer receives, for the term of the arrangement, the right to any updates that may be introduced into the licensed aspenONE software suite. When a customer elects to license point products, our Premier Plus SMS offering is included for the entire term of the arrangement and the customer receives, for the term of the arrangement, the right to any updates that may be introduced related to the specified products licensed. Maintenance represents a stand-ready obligation and, due to our obligation to provide unspecified future software updates on a when-and-if available basis as well as telephone support services, we are required to recognize revenue ratably over the term of the arrangement.\nServices and Other Revenue\nProfessional Services Revenue\nProfessional services are provided to customers on a T&M or fixed-price basis. The obligation to provide professional services is generally satisfied over time, with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits as we satisfy our performance obligation. For professional services, revenue is recognized by measuring progress toward the completion of our obligations. We recognize professional services fees for our T&M contracts based upon hours worked and contractually agreed-upon hourly rates. Revenue from fixed-price engagements is recognized using the proportional performance method based on the ratio of costs incurred to the total estimated project costs. The use of the proportional performance method is dependent upon our ability to reliably estimate the costs to complete a project. We use historical experience as a basis for future estimates to complete current projects. Additionally, we believe that costs are the best available measure of performance. Out-of-pocket expenses which are reimbursed by customers are recorded as revenue.\nTraining Revenue\nWe provide training services to our customers, including on-site, Internet-based, public and customized training. The obligation to provide training services is generally satisfied over time, with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits as we satisfy our performance obligation. Revenue is recognized in the period in which the services are performed.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts generally contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation.\nAllocation of consideration: We allocate total contract consideration to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it was sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers.\nIf the arrangement contains professional services and other products or services, we allocate to the professional service obligation a portion of the total contract consideration based on the standalone selling price of professional services that is observed from consistently priced standalone sales.\nThe standalone selling price for term licenses, which are always sold with maintenance, is the price for the combined license and maintenance bundle. The amount assigned to the license and maintenance bundle is separated into license and maintenance amounts using the respective standalone selling prices represented by the value relationship between the software license and maintenance.\nWhen two or more contracts are entered into at or near the same time with the same customer, we evaluate the facts and circumstances associated with the negotiation of those contracts. Where the contracts are negotiated as a package, we will\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\naccount for them as a single arrangement and allocate the consideration for the combined contracts among the performance obligations accordingly.\nStandalone selling price: When available, we use directly observable transactions to determine the standalone selling prices for performance obligations. Generally, directly observable data is not available for term licenses and maintenance. When term licenses are sold together with maintenance in a bundled arrangement, we estimate a standalone selling price for these distinct performance obligations using relevant information, including our overall pricing objectives and strategies and historical pricing data, and taking into consideration market conditions and other factors.\nOther policies and judgments\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment annually over the term of the license arrangement. Therefore, we generally receive payment from a customer after the performance obligation related to the license has been satisfied, and therefore, our contracts generally contain a significant financing component. The significant financing component is calculated utilizing an interest rate that derives the net present value of the performance obligations delivered on an upfront basis based on the allocation of consideration. We have instituted a customer portfolio approach in assigning interest rates. The rates are determined at contract inception and are based on the credit characteristics of the customers within each portfolio.\nContract modifications\nWe sometimes enter into agreements to modify previously executed contracts, which constitute contract modifications. We assess each of these contract modifications to determine (i) if the additional products and services are distinct from the products and services in the original arrangement; and (ii) if the amount of consideration expected for the added products and services reflects the stand-alone selling price of those products and services, as adjusted for contract-specific circumstances. A contract modification meeting both criteria is accounted for as a separate contract. A contract modification not meeting both criteria is considered a change to the original contract and is accounted for on either (i) a prospective basis as a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract\u037e or (ii) a cumulative catch-up basis. Generally, our contract modifications meet both criteria and are accounted for as a separate contract, as adjusted for contract-specific circumstances.\nContract Costs\nWe pay commissions for new product sales as well as for renewals of existing contracts. Commissions paid to obtain renewal contracts are not commensurate with the commissions paid for new product sales and therefore, a portion of the commissions paid for new contracts relate to future renewals.\nWe account for new product sales commissions using a portfolio approach and allocate the cost of commissions in proportion to the allocation of transaction price of license and maintenance performance obligations, including assumed renewals. Commissions allocated to the license and license renewal components are expensed at the time the license revenue is recognized. Commissions allocated to maintenance are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of four to eight years for new contracts, reflecting our estimate of the expected period that we will benefit from those commissions.\nAmortization of capitalized contract costs is included in sales and marketing expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 (o) \"New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal 2021\" and Note 2 (p) \"Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements,\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information about recent accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page 51. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations.\nOur fiscal year ends on June 30, and references to a specific fiscal year are the twelve months ended June 30 of such year (for example, \"fiscal 2021\" refers to the year ended June 30, 2021).\n\nBusiness Overview\nWe are a global leader in asset optimization software that optimizes asset design, operations and maintenance in complex, industrial environments. We combine decades of process modeling and operations expertise with big data, artificial intelligence, and advanced analytics. Our purpose-built software improves the competitiveness and profitability of our customers by: increasing throughput, energy efficiency, and production levels; reducing unplanned downtime, plant emissions, and safety risks; enhancing capital efficiency; and decreasing working capital requirements over the entire asset lifecycle to support operational excellence.\nOur software combines our proprietary mathematical and empirical models of manufacturing and planning processes which reflects the deep domain expertise we have amassed from focusing on solutions for the process and other capital-intensive industries for over 40 years. Our products have embedded AI capabilities that create insights, provide guidance, and automate and democratize knowledge, known as Industrial AI, to create more value for the process industries. We have developed our applications to design and optimize processes across three principal business areas: engineering, manufacturing and supply chain, and asset performance management. Each business area leverages our artificial intelligence of things products as the foundation of industrial data to help us realize our vision for Industrial AI at scale. We are the recognized market and technology leader in providing process optimization and asset performance management software for each of these business areas.\nWe have established sustainable competitive advantages based on the following strengths:\n\u2022Innovative products that can enhance our customers' profitability and productivity;\n\u2022Long-term customer relationships;\n\u2022Large installed base of users of our software; and\n\u2022Long-term license contracts.\nWe have approximately 2,500 customers globally. Our customers consist of companies engaged in the process and other capital-intensive industries such as energy, chemicals, engineering and construction, as well as pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, transportation, power, metals and mining, pulp and paper, and consumer packaged goods.\nBusiness Segments\nWe have two operating and reportable segments, which are consistent with our reporting units: (i) subscription and software and (ii) services and other. The subscription and software segment is engaged in the licensing of process optimization and asset performance management software solutions and associated support services, and includes our license and maintenance revenue. The services and other segment includes professional services and training, and includes our services and other revenue.\nRecent Events\nIn December 2019, the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and associated COVID 19 disease, or COVID-19, were reported in China, and in March 2020 the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. Since the beginning of March 2020, the sudden decrease in demand for oil due to the COVID-19 pandemic, compounded by the excess supply arising from producers' failure to agree on production cuts, resulted in a drop in oil prices. During fiscal 2021, our business was negatively impacted by these factors. Specifically, we saw a slowdown in closing customer contracts, a slight increase in our customer attrition rate due to non-renewals and renewals at lower entitlement level and, to a lesser extent, a slowdown in customer payments. We are continuing to assess the impact of these items on global markets and the various industries of our customers. The extent of the impact on our operational and financial performance going forward will depend on capital expenditure and operational expenditure budgetary cycles that are inherent in our customers' procurement strategies, which are informed by oil prices and environmental factors such as COVID-19, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. We are continuing to monitor the potential impacts related to the current disruption of COVID-19 and uncertainty in the global markets on the various industries of our customers. These factors could potentially impact the signing of new agreements, as well as the recoverability of assets, including accounts receivable and contract costs.\n\nOn June 14, 2021, as part of our common stock repurchase program, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program, or the ASR Program, with a third-party financial institution. Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Program, on July 1, 2021 we made an upfront payment of $150.0 million in exchange for an initial delivery of approximately 872,473 shares of our common stock, representing 80% of the total shares ultimately expected to be delivered over the program's term.\nAt the ASR Program's conclusion, the financial institution may be required to deliver additional shares of common stock to us, or, under certain circumstances, we may be required to, at our election, deliver shares of our common stock or make a cash payment to the financial institution. Final settlement of the ASR Program is expected to occur during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, with the number of shares to be delivered, or the amount of any cash payment to be made, determined based on the volume-weighted average price per share of our common stock over the term of the ASR Program, less an agreed-upon discount.\nKey Components of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue primarily from the following sources:\nLicense Revenue. We sell our software products to end users, primarily under fixed-term licenses, through a subscription offering which we refer to as our aspenONE licensing model. The aspenONE licensing model includes software maintenance and support, known as our Premier Plus SMS offering, for the entire term. Our aspenONE products are organized into three suites: 1) engineering; 2) manufacturing and supply chain; and 3) asset performance management. Each product suite leverages our AIoT products as the foundation of industrial data. Our APM product suite is licensed by customer sites, user seats or cloud connections. The engineering and manufacturing and supply chain product suites are licensed by tokens, which are interchangeable measures of usage based on the various units of measure such as users, servers, applications, manipulated variables, etc. Customers may use tokens flexibly to access one or more products in the suite in any combination. This licensing system enables customers to use products as needed, and to experiment with different products to best solve whatever critical business challenges the customer faces, and to license additional tokens as business needs evolve.\nWe also license our software through point product arrangements with our Premier Plus SMS offering included for the contract term.\nMaintenance Revenue. We provide customers technical support, access to software fixes and updates and the right to any new unspecified future software products and updates that may be introduced into the licensed aspenONE software suite. Our technical support services are provided from our customer support centers throughout the world, as well as via email and through our support website.\nServices and Other Revenue. We provide training and professional services to our customers. Our professional services are focused on implementing our technology in order to improve customers' plant performance and gain better operational data. Customers who use our professional services typically engage us to provide those services over periods of up to 24 months. We charge customers for professional services on a time-and-materials or fixed-price basis. We provide training services to our customers, including on-site, Internet-based and customized training.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of License. Our cost of license revenue consists of (i) royalties, (ii) amortization of capitalized software and intangible assets, and (iii) distribution fees.\nCost of Maintenance. Our cost of maintenance revenue consists primarily of personnel-related costs of providing Premier Plus SMS bundled with our aspenONE licensing and point product arrangements.\nCost of Services and Other. Our cost of services and other revenue consists primarily of personnel-related and external consultant costs associated with providing our customers professional services and training.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling and Marketing Expenses. Selling expenses consist primarily of the personnel and travel expenses related to the effort expended to license our products and services to current and potential customers, as well as for overall management of customer relationships. Marketing expenses include expenses needed to promote our company and our products and to conduct market research to help us better understand our customers and their business needs.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses related to the creation of new software products, enhancements and engineering changes to existing products.\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses include the personnel expenses of corporate and support functions, such as executive leadership and administration groups, finance, legal, human resources and corporate communications, and other costs, such as outside professional and consultant fees, amortization of intangible assets, and the provision for bad debt on accounts receivable.\nOther Income and Expenses\nInterest Income. Interest income is recorded for financing components under Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) or Topic 606. When a contract includes a significant financing component, we generally receive the majority of the customer consideration after the recognition of a substantial portion of the arrangement fee as license revenue. As a result, we decrease the amount of revenue recognized and increase interest income by a corresponding amount.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense is primarily related to outstanding borrowings under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net. Other (expense) income, net is comprised primarily of foreign currency exchange gains (losses) generated from the settlement and remeasurement of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our entities.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes is comprised of domestic and foreign taxes. We record interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events, such as tax benefits from the disposition of employee equity awards, settlements of tax audits and assessments and tax law changes. Our effective income tax rate is also impacted by, and may fluctuate in any given period because of, the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ.\nKey Business Metrics\nBackground\nWe utilize key business measures to track and assess the performance of our business. We have identified the following set of appropriate business metrics in the context of our evolving business:\n\u2022Annual spend\n\u2022Total contract value\n\u2022Bookings\nWe also use the following non-GAAP business metrics in addition to GAAP measures to track our business performance:\n\u2022Free cash flow\n\u2022Non-GAAP operating income\nWe make these measures available to investors and none of these metrics should be considered as an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nAnnual Spend\nAnnual spend is an estimate of the annualized value of our portfolio of term license agreements, as of a specific date. Annual spend is calculated by summing the most recent annual invoice value of each of our active term license agreements. Annual spend also includes the annualized value of standalone SMS agreements purchased with certain legacy term license agreements, which have become an immaterial part of our business.\n\nComparing annual spend for different dates can provide insight into the growth and retention rates of our business, because annual spend represents the estimated annualized billings associated with our active term license agreements. Management utilizes the annual spend business metric to evaluate the growth and performance of our business as well as for planning and forecasting. In addition, our corporate and executive bonus programs are based in part on our success in meeting targets for growth in annual spend that are approved by our Board of Directors. We believe that annual spend is a useful business metric to investors as it provides insight into the growth component of our term licenses and to how management evaluates and forecasts the results of the business.\nAnnual spend increases as a result of new term license agreements with new or existing customers, renewals or modifications of existing term license agreements that result in higher license fees due to contractually-agreed price escalation or an increase in the number of tokens (units of software usage) or products licensed, and escalation of annual payments in our active term license agreements.\nAnnual spend is adversely affected by term license and standalone SMS agreements that are renewed at a lower entitlement level or not renewed and, to a lesser extent, by customer agreements that become inactive during the agreement's term because, in our determination, amounts due (or which will become due) under the agreement are not collectible. Because the annual spend calculation includes all of our active term license agreements, the reported balance may include agreements with customers that are delinquent in paying invoices, that are in bankruptcy proceedings, or where payment is otherwise in doubt.\nAs of June 30, 2021, approximately 90% of our term license agreements (by value) are denominated in U.S. dollars. For agreements denominated in other currencies, we use a fixed historical exchange rate to calculate annual spend in dollars rather than using current exchange rates, so that our calculation of growth in annual spend is not affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies.\nBeginning in fiscal 2019 and for all future periods, for term license agreements that contain professional services or other products and services, we have included in the annual spend calculation the portion of the invoice allocable to the term license under Topic 606 rather than the portion of the invoice attributed to the license in the agreement. We believe that methodology more accurately allocates any discounts or premiums to the different elements of the agreement. We have not applied this methodology retroactively for agreements entered into in prior fiscal years.\nWe estimate that annual spend grew by approximately 4.8% during fiscal 2021, from $593.1 million as of June 30, 2020 to $621.3 million as of June 30, 2021. We estimate that annual spend grew by approximately 9.6% during fiscal 2020, from $541.0 million as of June 30, 2019 to $593.1 million as of June 30, 2020.\nTotal Contract Value\nTotal Contract Value (\"TCV\") is the aggregate value of all payments received or to be received under all active term license agreements, including maintenance and escalation. TCV was $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nBookings\nBookings is the total value of customer term license contracts signed in the current period, less the value of such contracts signed in the current period where the initial licenses are not yet deemed delivered, plus term license contracts signed in a previous period for which the initial licenses are deemed delivered in the current period.\nBookings was $774.5 million during fiscal 2021, compared to $610.1 million and $651.8 million during fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change in bookings during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 is related to the timing of renewals.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe use a non-GAAP measure of free cash flow to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. Management believes that this financial measure is useful to investors because it permits investors to view our performance using the same tools that management uses to gauge progress in achieving our goals. We believe this measure is also useful to investors because it is an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund investments in future growth initiatives or to repay borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and it is a basis for comparing our performance with that of our competitors. The presentation of free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.\n\nFree cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for the net impact of (a) purchases of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, (b) payments for capitalized computer software costs, and (c) other nonrecurring items, such as acquisition related payments.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP cash flow from operating activities to free cash flow for the indicated periods:\n\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nTotal free cash flow increased $34.4 million during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to changes in working capital. For a more detailed description of these changes refer to \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nTotal free cash flow increased $6.3 million during fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to changes in working capital. For a more detailed description of these changes refer to \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nNon-GAAP Income from Operations\nNon-GAAP income from operations excludes certain non-cash and non-recurring expenses, and is used as a supplement to income from operations presented on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP income from operations is a useful financial measure because removing certain non-cash and other items provides additional insight into recurring profitability and cash flow from operations.\nThe following table presents our income from operations, as adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and other items, such as the impact of acquisition related fees, for the indicated periods:\n\n\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the results of operations, percentage of total revenue and the year-over-year percentage change in certain financial data for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nRevenue\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nTotal revenue increased by $110.7 million during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase of $110.7 million was due to an increase in license revenue of $109.3 million and an increase in maintenance revenue of $7.0 million partially offset by a decrease in services and other revenue of $(5.7) million, as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nTotal revenue increased by $2.0 million during fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase of $2.0 million was due to an increase in maintenance revenue of $14.6 million and an increase in services and other revenue of $3.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in license revenue of $(16.4) million as compared to the prior fiscal year.\n\nLicense Revenue\n\nWe expect license revenue to increase or decrease as a result of: (i) dollar value of bookings in the period; and (ii) timing of renewals.\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nThe increase in license revenue of $109.3 million during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to an increase in bookings related to the timing of renewals.\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nThe decrease in license revenue of $(16.4) million during fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to a decrease in bookings and the timing of renewals.\nMaintenance Revenue\n\nWe expect maintenance revenue to increase as a result of: (i) having a larger base of arrangements recognized on a ratable basis; (ii) increased customer usage of our software; (iii) adding new customers; and (iv) escalating annual payments.\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nThe increase in maintenance revenue of $7.0 million during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to growth of our base of arrangements, which include maintenance, being recognized on a ratable basis.\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nThe increase in maintenance revenue of $14.6 million during fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to growth of our base of arrangements, which include maintenance, being recognized on a ratable basis.\nServices and Other Revenue\n\nWe recognize professional services revenue for our time-and-materials (\"T&M\") contracts based upon hours worked and contractually agreed-upon hourly rates. Revenue from fixed-price engagements is recognized using the proportional performance method based on the ratio of costs incurred to the total estimated project costs.\n\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nServices and other revenue decreased by $(5.7) million during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in bookings, delay in timing of professional service engagements, and an increase in discounts provided for the professional services engagements to help generate license growth.\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nServices and other revenue increased by $3.9 million during fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the timing of professional services engagements.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of License Revenue\n\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nCost of license revenue increased by $2.0 million during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in cost of license revenue during fiscal 2021 was primarily due to increased amortization of intangible assets attributable to acquisitions in the current year. License gross profit margin was 98.1% in fiscal 2021 and was relatively consistent with that of fiscal 2020.\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nCost of license revenue increased by $0.2 million during fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in cost of license revenue during fiscal 2020 was primarily due to increased amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions. License gross profit margin was 98.1% in fiscal 2020 and was consistent with that of fiscal 2019.\nCost of Maintenance Revenue\n\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nCost of maintenance revenue was relatively consistent during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year. Maintenance gross profit margin was 90.1% in fiscal 2021 and was relatively consistent with that of fiscal 2020.\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nCost of maintenance revenue was relatively consistent during fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year. Maintenance gross profit margin was 89.2% in fiscal 2020 and was relatively consistent with that of fiscal 2019.\n\nCost of Services and Other Revenue\n\nThe timing of revenue and expense recognition on professional service arrangements can impact the comparability of cost and gross profit margin of professional services revenue from year to year. For example, revenue from fixed-price engagements is recognized using the proportional performance method based on the ratio of costs incurred to the total estimated project costs.\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nCost of services and other revenue decreased by $(2.5) million during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in cost of services and other revenue during fiscal 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in subcontractor costs. Services and other gross profit margin was (21.9)% in fiscal 2021, compared to (8.4)% in fiscal 2020. The decrease in gross profit margin is attributable to an increase in discounts provided for the professional service engagements in fiscal 2021.\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nCost of services and other revenue increased by $3.6 million during fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in cost of services and other revenue during fiscal 2020 was primarily due to higher cost of delivering professional services to support the corresponding increase in revenue during the period. Services and other gross profit margin was (10.8)% in fiscal 2020, compared to (16.2)% in fiscal 2019.\nGross Profit\n\nFor further discussion of subscription and software gross profit and services and other gross profit, please refer to the Cost of License Revenue,\" \"Cost of Maintenance Revenue,\" and Cost of Services and Other Revenue\u201d sections above.\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nGross profit increased by $112.1 million during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year. Gross profit margin increased to 91.5% in fiscal 2021 compared to 89.7% in fiscal 2020 due to the growth in license revenue compared to the related costs.\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nGross profit decreased by $(1.8) million during fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year and gross profit margin remained relatively consistent at 89.7% in fiscal 2020 compared to that of fiscal 2019.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling and Marketing Expense\n\n\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nThe year-over-year increase of $0.5 million in selling and marketing expense in fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year was due to higher compensation costs of $3.2 million primarily related to an increase in headcount, and an increase in marketing programs of $3.0 million including our biennial customer conference being held this fiscal year. The increase in selling and marketing expense is offset by lower travel-related costs of $5.2 million in fiscal 2021.\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nThe year-over-year increase of $3.1 million in selling and marketing expense in fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to higher compensation costs of $6.9 million related to an increase in headcount and higher stock-based compensation of $1.0 million, partially offset by lower travel-related costs of $1.8 million, lower royalties of $0.9 million, and lower marketing costs of $0.8 million due to our biennial customer conference held in fiscal 2019.\nResearch and Development Expense\n\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nThe year-over-year increase of $2.0 million in research and development expense in fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to higher compensation costs of $1.9 million related to an increase in headcount.\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nThe year-over-year increase of $9.1 million in research and development expense in fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to higher compensation costs of $6.8 million related to an increase in headcount and higher stock-based compensation of $1.7 million.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\n\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nThe year-over-year increase of $8.6 million in general and administrative expense during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to higher bad debt expense of $4.5 million, acquisition related fees of $4.4 million, and higher stock-based compensation of $1.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in legal costs of $3.4 million.\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nThe year-over-year increase of $9.8 million in general and administrative expense during fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to higher professional fees of $3.1 million, higher bad debt expense of $2.0 million, higher compensation costs of $1.7 million related to an increase in headcount, and higher stock-based compensation of $0.7 million.\n\nNon-Operating Income (Expense)\nInterest Income\n\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nThe year-over-year increase of $4.1 million in interest income during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year was a result of: (i) increased customer usage of our software; (ii) adding new customers; and (iii) escalating annual payments.\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nThe year-over-year increase of $4.2 million in interest income during fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year was a result of: (i) increased customer usage of our software; (ii) adding new customers; and (iii) escalating annual payments.\nInterest Expense\n\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nThe year-over-year decrease of $4.6 million in interest expense during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to less interest associated with the revolving line of credit under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement due to the repayment of the outstanding balance during fiscal 2021 and a lower interest rate associated with the term loan.\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nThe year-over-year increase of $3.1 million in interest expense during fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to interest expenses related to an increase in borrowings under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net is comprised primarily of unrealized and realized foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated from the settlement and remeasurement of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our entities\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nOther income, net was comprised of $3.4 million of net foreign currency exchange losses during fiscal 2021 compared to a $(0.9) million net foreign currency gains for fiscal 2020.\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\n\nOther income, net was comprised of $1.2 million and $0.7 million of net foreign currency exchange gains during fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nThe effective tax rate for the periods presented is primarily the result of income earned in the U.S. taxed at U.S. federal and state statutory income tax rates, income earned in foreign tax jurisdictions taxed at the applicable rates, as well as the impact of permanent differences between book and tax income.\nOur effective tax rate was 16.9% and 17.8% during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWe recognized income tax expense of $64.9 million during fiscal 2021compared to $49.7 million during fiscal 2020. Fiscal 2021 was impacted primarily by the higher pre-tax book income, offset by the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income ( FDII\u201d) deduction, tax credits, and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Assuming certain requirements are met, the FDII deduction is a benefit for US companies that sell their products or services to customers for use outside the US. Fiscal 2020 was unfavorably impacted by the recognition of $6.4 million tax expense due to an accounting method change election when we filed our fiscal 2019 federal tax return as a result of a change in tax regulations during this fiscal year. Fiscal 2020 was favorably impacted by the FDII deduction and tax credits.\nAs of June 30, 2021, we maintained a valuation allowance in the U.S. primarily for certain deferred tax assets related to the investment in a joint venture and on state research and development (R&D) credits. We also maintain a valuation allowance on certain foreign subsidiary tax attributes, primarily net operating loss carryforwards because it is more likely than not that a benefit will not be realized. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, our total valuation allowance was $9.9 million and $6.2 million, respectively.\nWe made cash tax payments totaling $61.4 million during fiscal 2021. We paid $58.4 million for U.S. federal and state income taxes and $3.0 million for foreign tax liabilities\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nThe effective tax rate for the periods presented is primarily the result of income earned in the U.S. taxed at U.S. federal and state statutory income tax rates, income earned in foreign tax jurisdictions taxed at the applicable rates, as well as the impact of permanent differences between book and tax income.\nOur effective tax rate was 17.8% and 13.3% during fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe recognized income tax expense of $49.7 million during fiscal 2020 compared to $40.2 million during fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2020 was unfavorably impacted by the recognition of $6.4 million tax expense due to an accounting method change election when we filed our fiscal 2019 federal tax return as a result of a change in tax regulations during this fiscal year. Fiscal 2020 was favorably impacted by the FDII deduction and tax credits. Assuming certain requirements are met, the FDII deduction is a benefit for US companies that sell their products or services to customers for use outside the US. Fiscal 2019 was also favorably impacted by the FDII deduction and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.\nAs of June 30, 2020, we maintain a valuation allowance in the U.S. primarily for certain deferred tax assets related to the investment in a joint venture and on state research and development (R&D) credits. We also maintain a valuation allowance on certain foreign subsidiary tax attributes, primarily net operating loss carryforwards because it is more likely than not that a benefit will not be realized. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, our total valuation allowance was $6.2 million and $4.9 millions, respectively.\nWe made cash tax payments totaling $39.5 million during fiscal 2020. We paid $37.1 million for U.S. federal and state income taxes and $2.4 million for foreign tax liabilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nResources\nIn recent years, we have financed our operations with cash generated from operating activities. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $379.9 million and $287.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with our cash flows from operating activities, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months. We may need to raise additional funds if we decide to make one or more acquisitions of businesses, technologies or products. If additional funding for such purposes is required beyond existing resources and our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement described below, we may not be able to effect a receivable, equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nCredit Agreement\nIn December 2019, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner, Silicon Valley Bank, as joint lead arranger, joint bookrunner and syndication agent, and the lenders and co-documentation agents named therein (the \"Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\"). The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which amends and restates the prior Credit Agreement we entered into as of February 26, 2016 with the same lenders (the Prior Credit Agreement\u201d), provides for a $200.0 million secured revolving credit facility and a $320.0 million secured term loan facility. The indebtedness under the revolving credit facility matures on December 23, 2024. Prior to the maturity of the revolving credit facility under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, any amounts borrowed under the facility may be repaid and, subject to the terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, borrowed again in whole or in part without penalty.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we paid off the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility of $119.2 million. As of June 30, 2021, our current borrowings of $20.0 million consist of the term loan facility. Our non-current borrowings of $273.2 million consist of $276.0 million of our term loan facility, net of $2.8 million in debt issuance costs. We had current borrowings of $135.2 million and non-current borrowings of $292.4 million as of June 30, 2020.\nFor a more detailed description of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, refer to Note 12, \"Credit Agreement,\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash Equivalents and Cash Flows\nOur cash equivalents of $1.0 million as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, consisted of money market funds. The objective of our investment policy is to manage our cash and investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated:\n\nOperating Activities\nOur primary source of cash is from the annual installments associated with our software license arrangements and related software support services, and to a lesser extent from professional services and training. We believe that cash inflows from our term license business will grow as we benefit from the continued growth of our portfolio of term license contracts.\nFiscal 2021\nCash from operating activities provided $276.1 million during fiscal 2021. This amount resulted from net income of $319.8 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $79.1 million, and net uses of cash of $(122.8) million related to changes in working capital.\n\nNon-cash items within net income consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $33.6 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $10.3 million, provision for bad debts of $9.7 million, reduction in the carrying amount of right-of-use assets of $8.9 million, deferred income taxes of $12.3 million, and net foreign currency losses of $3.4 million.\nCash used by working capital of $(122.8) million in fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in contract assets of $113.7 million, increases in prepaid expenses, prepaid income taxes, and other assets of $12.8 million, decreases in lease liabilities of $10.2 million, increases in accounts receivable of $2.1 million, and increases in contract costs of $0.4 million, partially offset by cash provided by increases in deferred revenue of $16.6 million.\nFiscal 2020\nCash from operating activities provided $243.3 million during fiscal 2020. This amount resulted from net income of $229.7 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $83.2 million, and net uses of cash of $(69.6) million related to changes in working capital.\nNon-cash items within net income consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $31.5 million, deferred income taxes of $28.1 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $9.6 million, reduction in the carrying amount of right-of-use assets of $9.1 million, provision for bad debts of $5.3 million, and net foreign currency gains of $(0.9) million.\nCash used by working capital of $(69.6) million was primarily attributable to cash used by increases in contract assets of $28.1 million, decreases in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $23.4 million, increases in accounts receivable of $12.9 million, decreases in lease liabilities of $9.5 million, increases in prepaid expenses, prepaid income taxes, and other assets of $5.3 million, and increases in contract costs of $3.6 million, partially offset by cash provided by increases in deferred revenue of $13.0 million.\nFiscal 2019\nCash from operating activities provided $238.3 million during fiscal 2019. This amount resulted from net income of $261.4 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $8.4 million, and net sources of cash of $(31.5) million related to changes in working capital.\nNon-cash items within net income consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $27.6 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $8.1 million, deferred income taxes of $(27.1) million, provision for bad debts of $0.6 million, and net foreign currency gains of $(1.3) million.\nCash used by working capital of $(31.5) million was primarily attributable to cash used by increases in contract assets of $57.7 million, increases in accounts receivable of $6.6 million, increases in contract costs of $4.5 million, and increases in prepaid expenses, prepaid income taxes, and other assets of $2.4 million, partially offset by cash provided by increases in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $21.9 million, and increases in deferred revenue of $17.8 million. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities is primarily due to an increase in income taxes payable as of June 30, 2019 from the tax liability associated with adopting Topic 606. There was a correlating decrease in deferred income taxes during fiscal 2019.\nInvesting Activities\nFiscal 2021\nDuring fiscal 2021, we used $19.8 million of cash from investing activities. We used $16.3 million for business acquisitions, $1.2 million for capital expenditures, $1.1 million for equity method investments, and $1.1 million for capitalized computer software development costs.\nFiscal 2020\nDuring fiscal 2020, we used $76.2 million of cash from investing activities. We used $74.5 million for business acquisitions, $1.3 million for capital expenditures, $0.3 million for equity method investments, and $0.1 million for capitalized computer software development costs.\nFiscal 2019\nDuring fiscal 2019, we used $7.7 million of cash from investing activities. We used $6.1 million for business acquisitions,$1.1 million for capitalized computer software development costs, and $0.4 million for capital expenditures.\n\nFinancing Activities\nFiscal 2021\nDuring fiscal 2021, we used $165.1 million of cash from financing activities. Uses of cash in the period included the repayment of the outstanding revolving line of credit of $119.2 million, $45.6 million for repurchases of our common stock, $16.0 million for repayments of the term loan, $9.2 million for withholding taxes on vested and settled restricted stock units, and $1.2 million for deferred business acquisition payments, partially offset by proceeds of $26.1 million from the exercise of employee stock options.\nFiscal 2020\nDuring fiscal 2020, $49.4 million of net cash was provided by financing activities. Sources of cash in the period included proceeds of $449.2 million from the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, $125.0 million from the Prior Credit Agreement, and proceeds of $9.0 million from the exercise of employee stock options, partially offset by uses of cash of $152.4 million for repurchases of our common stock, $10.2 million for withholding taxes on vested and settled restricted stock units, $345.0 million for repayments of the revolving line of credit from the Prior Credit Agreement, $10.0 million for repayments of the revolving line of credit and $8.0 million for repayments of the term loan from the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and $4.6 million for deferred business acquisition payments, and $3.5 million for debit issuance costs.\nFiscal 2019\nDuring fiscal 2019, we used $254.5 million of cash for financing activities. We used $299.2 million for repurchases of our common stock, $1.7 million for deferred business acquisition payments, and $14.5 million for withholding taxes on vested and settled restricted stock units. Sources of cash in the period included proceeds of $50.0 million from the Prior Credit Agreement and proceeds of $10.9 million from the exercise of employee stock options.\nContractual Obligations and Requirements\nOur contractual obligations, which consisted of borrowings, interest, and fees under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, operating lease commitments for our headquarters and other facilities, royalty obligations, equity method investments, deferred acquisition payments, and standby letters of credit and other obligations, were as follows as of June 30, 2021:\n\n____________________________________________\n(1)The $314.1 million of contractual obligations related to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement includes $296.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our term loan facility, and $18.1 million of interest expense and commitment fees as of June 30, 2021.\n(2)The $62.4 million of contractual obligations includes rent and fixed fees for all of our operating leases, including those not recognized on the balance sheet.\nWe are not currently a party to any other material purchase contracts related to future capital expenditures, and we do not expect our future investment in capital expenditures to be materially different from recent levels.\nThe standby letters of credit were issued by Silicon Valley Bank in the United States and secure our performance on professional services contracts and certain facility leases.\n\nThe above table does not reflect a liability for uncertain tax positions of $2.1 million as of June 30, 2021. We estimate that none of this amount will be paid within the next year and we are currently unable to reasonably estimate the timing of payments for the remainder of the liability.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of June 30, 2021, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Judgments\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nFor further information on our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies,\" and Note 3, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn accordance with Topic 606, we account for a customer contract when both parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations, each party's rights can be identified, payment terms can be identified, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable that we will collect substantially all of the consideration to which we are entitled. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer.\nNature of Products and Services\nWe generate revenue from the following sources: (1) License revenue; (2) Maintenance revenue; and (3) Services and other revenue. We sell our software products to end users primarily under fixed-term licenses. We license our software products primarily through a subscription offering which we refer to as our aspenONE licensing model, which includes software maintenance and support, known as our Premier Plus SMS offering, for the entire term. Our aspenONE products are organized into three suites: 1) engineering; 2) manufacturing and supply chain; and 3) asset performance management. Each product suite leverages our AIoT products as the foundation of industrial data. Our APM product suite is licensed by customer sites, user seats or cloud connections. The engineering and manufacturing and supply chain product suites are licensed by tokens, which are interchangeable measures of usage based on the various units of measure such as users, servers, applications, manipulated variables, etc. Customers may use tokens flexibly to access any product or combination of products in the licensed suite.\nWe also license our software through point product term arrangements, which include our Premier Plus SMS offering for the entire term.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022 Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022 Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022 Determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022 Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022 Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nTerm-based Arrangements: Term-based arrangements consist of on-premise term licenses as well as maintenance.\nLicense\n\nLicense revenue consists primarily of product and related revenue from our aspenONE licensing model and point product arrangements.\nWhen a customer elects to license our products under our aspenONE licensing model, the customer receives, for the term of the arrangement, the right to all software products in the licensed aspenONE software suite. When a customer elects to license point products, the customer receives, for the term of the arrangement, the right to license specified products in the licensed aspenONE software suite. Revenue from initial product licenses is recognized upfront upon delivery.\nMaintenance\nWhen a customer elects to license our products under our aspenONE licensing model, our Premier Plus SMS offering is included for the entire term of the arrangement and the customer receives, for the term of the arrangement, the right to any updates that may be introduced into the licensed aspenONE software suite. When a customer elects to license point products, our Premier Plus SMS offering is included for the entire term of the arrangement and the customer receives, for the term of the arrangement, the right to any updates that may be introduced related to the specified products licensed. Maintenance represents a stand-ready obligation and, due to our obligation to provide unspecified future software updates on a when-and-if available basis as well as telephone support services, we are required to recognize revenue ratably over the term of the arrangement.\nServices and Other Revenue\nProfessional Services Revenue\nProfessional services are provided to customers on a T&M or fixed-price basis. The obligation to provide professional services is generally satisfied over time, with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits as we satisfy our performance obligation. For professional services, revenue is recognized by measuring progress toward the completion of our obligations. We recognize professional services fees for our T&M contracts based upon hours worked and contractually agreed-upon hourly rates. Revenue from fixed-price engagements is recognized using the proportional performance method based on the ratio of costs incurred to the total estimated project costs. The use of the proportional performance method is dependent upon our ability to reliably estimate the costs to complete a project. We use historical experience as a basis for future estimates to complete current projects. Additionally, we believe that costs are the best available measure of performance. Out-of-pocket expenses which are reimbursed by customers are recorded as revenue.\nTraining Revenue\nWe provide training services to our customers, including on-site, Internet-based, public and customized training. The obligation to provide training services is generally satisfied over time, with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits as we satisfy our performance obligation. Revenue is recognized in the period in which the services are performed.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts generally contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation.\nAllocation of consideration: We allocate total contract consideration to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it was sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers.\nIf the arrangement contains professional services and other products or services, we allocate to the professional service obligation a portion of the total contract consideration based on the standalone selling price of professional services that is observed from consistently priced standalone sales.\nThe standalone selling price for term licenses, which are always sold with maintenance, is the price for the combined license and maintenance bundle. The amount assigned to the license and maintenance bundle is separated into license and maintenance amounts using the respective standalone selling prices represented by the value relationship between the software license and maintenance.\nWhen two or more contracts are entered into at or near the same time with the same customer, we evaluate the facts and circumstances associated with the negotiation of those contracts. Where the contracts are negotiated as a package, we will\n\naccount for them as a single arrangement and allocate the consideration for the combined contracts among the performance obligations accordingly.\nStandalone selling price: When available, we use directly observable transactions to determine the standalone selling prices for performance obligations. Generally, directly observable data is not available for term licenses and maintenance. When term licenses are sold together with maintenance in a bundled arrangement, we estimate a standalone selling price for these distinct performance obligations using relevant information, including our overall pricing objectives and strategies and historical pricing data, and taking into consideration market conditions and other factors.\nOther policies and judgments\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment annually over the term of the license arrangement. Therefore, we generally receive payment from a customer after the performance obligation related to the license has been satisfied, and therefore, our contracts generally contain a significant financing component. The significant financing component is calculated utilizing an interest rate that derives the net present value of the performance obligations delivered on an upfront basis based on the allocation of consideration. We have instituted a customer portfolio approach in assigning interest rates. The rates are determined at contract inception and are based on the credit characteristics of the customers within each portfolio.\nContract modifications\nWe sometimes enter into agreements to modify previously executed contracts, which constitute contract modifications. We assess each of these contract modifications to determine (i) if the additional products and services are distinct from the products and services in the original arrangement; and (ii) if the amount of consideration expected for the added products and services reflects the stand-alone selling price of those products and services, as adjusted for contract-specific circumstances. A contract modification meeting both criteria is accounted for as a separate contract. A contract modification not meeting both criteria is considered a change to the original contract and is accounted for on either (i) a prospective basis as a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract\u037e or (ii) a cumulative catch-up basis. Generally, our contract modifications meet both criteria and are accounted for as a separate contract, as adjusted for contract-specific circumstances.\nContract Costs\nWe pay commissions for new product sales as well as for renewals of existing contracts. Commissions paid to obtain renewal contracts are not commensurate with the commissions paid for new product sales and therefore, a portion of the commissions paid for new contracts relate to future renewals.\nWe account for new product sales commissions using a portfolio approach and allocate the cost of commissions in proportion to the allocation of transaction price of license and maintenance performance obligations, including assumed renewals. Commissions allocated to the license and license renewal components are expensed at the time the license revenue is recognized. Commissions allocated to maintenance are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of four to eight years for new contracts, reflecting our estimate of the expected period that we will benefit from those commissions.\nAmortization of capitalized contract costs is included in sales and marketing expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nRecent
