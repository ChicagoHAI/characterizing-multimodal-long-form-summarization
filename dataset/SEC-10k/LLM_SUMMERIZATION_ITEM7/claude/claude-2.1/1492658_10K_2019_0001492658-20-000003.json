Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations describes the principal factors affecting the results of our operations, financial condition, and changes in financial condition, as well as our critical accounting estimates.\nOn November 4, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement with Stryker and its subsidiary, Stryker B.V. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Stryker B.V. has commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Wright for $30.75 per share, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes, in cash. The offer is currently scheduled to expire at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on February 27, 2020, but may be extended in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement between Stryker and Wright. The closing of the transaction is subject to receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, the adoption of certain resolutions relating to the transaction at an extraordinary general meeting of Wright's shareholders, completion of the tender offer, and other customary closing conditions.\nOn August 24, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the outstanding equity on a fully diluted basis of Cartiva, an orthopaedic medical device company focused on treatment of osteoarthritis of the great toe, for a total price of $435.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the agreement. On October 10, 2018, we completed the acquisition, which added a differentiated PMA approved technology for a high-volume foot and ankle procedure and further accelerated growth opportunities in our global extremities business. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional details related to the Cartiva acquisition. We funded the Cartiva acquisition with the proceeds from a registered underwritten public offering of 18.2 million ordinary shares which resulted in net proceeds of $423.0 million. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional details related to the public offering.\nOn January 9, 2014, legacy Wright completed the sale of its former OrthoRecon business to MicroPort. The financial results of the OrthoRecon business are reflected within discontinued operations for all periods presented, unless otherwise noted.\nAll current and historical operating results for the OrthoRecon business is reflected within discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements.\nOther than the discontinued operations discussed in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d, unless otherwise stated, all discussion of assets and liabilities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in this section, reflects the assets and liabilities held and used in our continuing operations, and all discussion of revenues and expenses reflects those associated with our continuing operations.\nReferences in this section to we,\u201d our\u201d and us\u201d refer to Wright Medical Group N.V. and its subsidiaries after the Wright/Tornier merger and Wright Medical Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries before the merger. Our fiscal year-end is generally determined on a 52-week basis and runs from the Monday nearest to the 31st of December of a year, and ends on the Sunday nearest to the 31st of December of the following year. Every few years, it is necessary to add an extra week to the year making it a 53-week period. The fiscal years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 were 52-week periods. The fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 was a 53-week period. References in this report to a particular year generally refer to the applicable fiscal year. Accordingly, references to 2019\u201d or the year ended December 29, 2019\u201d mean the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019.\nExecutive Overview\nCompany Description. We are a global medical device company focused on extremities and biologics products. We are committed to delivering innovative, value-added solutions improving quality of life for patients worldwide and are a recognized leader of\nsurgical solutions for the upper extremities (shoulder, elbow, wrist and hand), lower extremities (foot and ankle) and biologics markets, three of the fastest growing segments in orthopaedics.\nOur global corporate headquarters are located in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We also have significant operations located in Memphis, Tennessee (U.S. headquarters, research and development, sales and marketing administration, and administrative activities); Bloomington, Minnesota (upper extremities sales and marketing and warehousing operations); Arlington, Tennessee (manufacturing and warehousing operations); Franklin, Tennessee (manufacturing and warehousing operations); Columbia City, Indiana (research and development); Alpharetta, Georgia (manufacturing and warehousing operations); Montbonnot, France (manufacturing and warehousing operations); Plouzan\u00e9, France (research and development); and Macroom, Ireland (manufacturing). In addition, we have local sales and distribution offices in Canada, Australia, Asia, Latin America, and throughout Europe.\nWe offer a broad product portfolio of approximately 150 extremities products and approximately 20 biologics products that are designed to provide solutions to our surgeon customers, with the goal of improving clinical outcomes and the quality of life\u201d for their patients. Our product portfolio consists of the following product categories:\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Upper extremities, which include joint implants and bone fixation devices for the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Lower extremities, which include joint implants and bone fixation devices for the foot and ankle;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Biologics, which include products used to support treatment of damaged or diseased bone, tendons, and soft tissues or to stimulate bone growth; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Sports medicine and other, which include products used across several anatomic sites to mechanically repair tissue-to-tissue or tissue-to-bone injuries and other ancillary products.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our sales and distribution system in the United States currently consists of 80 geographic sales territories that are staffed by over 500 direct sales representatives and 29 independent sales agencies or distributors. These sales representatives and independent sales agencies and distributors are generally aligned to selling either our upper extremities products or lower extremities products, but, in some cases, certain agencies or direct sales representatives sell products from both our upper and lower extremities product portfolios in their territories. Internationally, we utilize several distribution approaches that are tailored to the needs and requirements of each individual market. Our international sales and distribution system currently consists of 13 direct sales offices and approximately 90 distributors that sell our products in approximately 50 countries, with principal markets outside the United States in Europe, Asia, Canada, Australia, and Latin America. Our U.S. sales accounted for 76.7% and 74.6% of total net sales for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nPrincipal Products. We have focused our efforts into growing our position in the high-growth extremities and biologics markets. We believe a more active and aging patient population with higher expectations regarding quality of life,\u201d an increasing global awareness of extremities and biologics solutions, improved clinical outcomes as a result of the use of such products, and technological advances resulting in specific designs for such products that simplify procedures and address unmet needs for early interventions, and the growing need for revisions and revision-related solutions will drive the market for extremities and biologics products.\nThe extremities market is one of the fastest growing market segments within orthopaedics, with annual growth rates of 7-10%. We believe major trends in the extremities market include procedure-specific and anatomy-specific devices, locking plates, and an increase in total ankle replacement or arthroplasty procedures. Upper extremities reconstruction involves implanting devices to replace, reconstruct, or fixate injured or diseased joints and bones in the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand. It is estimated that approximately 60% of the upper extremities market is in total shoulder replacement or arthroplasty implants. We believe major trends in the upper extremities market include next-generation joint arthroplasty systems, bone preserving solutions, virtual planning systems, and revision of failed previous shoulder replacements in older patients. Lower extremities reconstruction involves implanting devices to replace, reconstruct, or fixate injured or diseased joints and bones in the foot and ankle. A large segment of the lower extremities market is comprised of plating and screw systems for reconstructing and fusing joints or repairing bones after traumatic injury. We believe major trends in the lower extremities market include the use of external fixation devices in diabetic patients, total ankle arthroplasty, advanced tissue fixation devices, virtual planning systems, and biologics. New technologies have been introduced into the lower extremities market in recent years, including next-generation total ankle replacement systems.\nOur principal upper extremities products include the AEQUALIS ASCEND\u00ae FLEX\u2122 convertible shoulder system and SIMPLICITI\u00ae total shoulder replacement system, AEQUALIS\u00ae PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System, and the AEQUALIS\u00ae REVERSED II\u2122 reversed shoulder system. SIMPLICITI\u00ae is the first minimally invasive, canal sparing total shoulder available in the United States. We believe SIMPLICITI\u00ae allows us to expand the market to include younger patients that historically have deferred these procedures. Our BLUEPRINT\u2122 3D Planning Software can be used with our products to assist surgeons in accurately positioning the glenoid and humeral implants and replicating the pre-operative surgical plan. Other principal upper extremities products include the EVOLVE\u00ae radial head prosthesis for elbow fractures, the EVOLVE\u00ae Elbow Plating System, and the\nRAYHACK\u00ae osteotomy system. FDA 510(k) clearance of the AEQUALIS\u00ae FLEX REVIVE\u2122 revision shoulder system was received in the third quarter of 2018. AEQUALIS\u00ae FLEX REVIVE\u2122 was launched to limited users early in the first quarter of 2019 and was fully launched at the end of the second quarter of 2019.\nOur principal lower extremities products include the INBONE\u00ae, INFINITY\u00ae, and INVISION\u2122 Total Ankle Replacement systems, all of which can be used with our PROPHECY\u00ae Preoperative Navigation Guides, which combine computer imaging with a patient's CT scan, and are designed to provide alignment accuracy while reducing surgical steps. As a result of our October 2018 acquisition of Cartiva, our lower extremities product portfolio includes Cartiva's Synthetic Cartilage Implant (SCI), the only PMA approved product for treatment of first Metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint osteoarthritis. Our lower extremities products also include the Salvation external fixation system for the treatment of Charcot diabetic foot, the CLAW\u00ae II Polyaxial Compression Plating System, the ORTHOLOC\u2122 3Di Reconstruction Plating System, the PHALINX\u00ae system used for hammertoe indications, PRO-TOE\u00ae VO Hammertoe System, the VALOR\u00ae ankle fusion nail system, and the Swanson line of toe joint replacement products. The PROstep\u2122 Minimally Invasive Surgery system for foot and ankle was launched to limited users in the third quarter of 2017, and was fully launched early in the third quarter of 2018. We also launched a number of line extensions to the SALVATION\u2122 limb salvage portfolio in 2018. We expect continued demand for these new products.\nThe field of biologics employs tissue engineering and regenerative medicine technologies focused on remodeling and regeneration of tendons, ligaments, bone, and cartilage. Biologic products use both biological tissue-based and synthetic materials to allow the body to regenerate damaged or diseased bone and to repair damaged or diseased soft tissue. These products aid the body's natural regenerative capabilities to heal itself. Biologic products provide a lower morbidity solution to autografting,\u201d a procedure that involves harvesting a patient's own bone or soft tissue and transplanting it to a different site. Following an autografting procedure, the patient typically has pain and, at times, complications result at the harvest site after surgery. Biologically or synthetically derived soft tissue grafts and scaffolds are used to treat soft tissue injuries and are complementary to many sports medicine applications, including rotator cuff tendon repair and Achilles tendon repair. Hard tissue biologics products are used in many bone fusion or trauma cases where healing potential may be compromised and additional biologic factors are desired to enhance healing, where the surgeon needs additional bone, or in cases where the surgeon wishes to use materials that are naturally incorporated by the body over time. We estimate that the worldwide orthobiologics market to be over $3.7 billion, and with annual growth rates of 3-4%. Three multinational companies currently dominate the orthobiologics industry.\nOur biologic products use both biological tissue-based and synthetic materials to allow the body to regenerate damaged or diseased bone and to repair damaged or diseased soft tissue. Our principal biologic products include AUGMENT\u00ae Bone Graft and AUGMENT\u00ae Injectable. AUGMENT\u00ae is based on recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (rhPDGF-BB), a synthetic copy of one of the body's principal healing agents. Other principal biologics products include the GRAFTJACKET\u00ae and GRAFTJACKET NOW\u2122 lines of soft tissue repair and containment membranes, the ACTISHIELD\u2122 and VIAFLOW\u2122 products which are derived from amniotic and placental tissues, the ALLOMATRIX\u00ae line of injectable tissue-based bone graft substitutes, the PRO-DENSE\u00ae Injectable Graft, the OSTEOSET\u00ae synthetic bone graft substitute, and the PRO-STIM\u00ae Injectable Inductive Graft. Additionally, we introduced BIOSKIN\u00ae Amniotic Wound Matrix in the third quarter of 2019 to address chronic wounds treated by surgical podiatrists.\nSignificant Business Developments. On November 4, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement with Stryker and its subsidiary, Stryker B.V. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Stryker B.V. has commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Wright for $30.75 per share, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes, in cash. The offer is currently scheduled to expire at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on February 27, 2020, but may be extended in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement between Stryker and Wright. The closing of the transaction is subject to receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, the adoption of certain resolutions relating to the transaction at an extraordinary general meeting of Wright's shareholders, completion of the tender offer, and other customary closing conditions.\nOn February 25, 2019, we amended the Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement dated December 23, 2016 with Midcap Financial Trust, as administrative agent and a lender and the additional lenders from time to time party thereto, to, among other things, increase the amount of commitments under the line of credit from $150 million to $175 million and under the second tranche of the term loan facility from $20 million to $35 million.\nDuring February 2019, we issued $139.6 million of additional 2023 Notes and settled $130.1 million of 2020 Notes. We paid approximately $30.1 million for additional 2023 Notes Hedges, and received approximately $21.2 million for additional 2023 warrants, resulting in a net cost to us of approximately $8.9 million. In connection with the above described exchange, we also settled a pro rata share of the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivatives, 2020 Notes Hedges, and warrants corresponding to the amount of 2020 Notes exchanged pursuant to this exchange. We received proceeds of approximately $16.8 million related to the 2020 Notes Hedges and paid $11.0 million related to the 2020 Warrants, generating net proceeds of $5.8 million.\nSupplemental Non-GAAP Pro Forma Information. Due to the significance of the Cartiva business that is not included in our results of operations for the year ended December 30, 2018 and to supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including organic and combined pro forma net sales.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive or standard set of accounting rules or principles. Accordingly, the calculation of our non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the definitions of other companies using the same or similar names limiting, to some extent, the usefulness of such measures for comparison purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. See tables below for a reconciliation of our non-GAAP organic and combined pro forma net sales for the years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 to our net sales for such periods as calculated in accordance with US GAAP.\nThe Results of Operations\u201d discussion that appears below has been presented utilizing a combination of historical unaudited and, where relevant, non-GAAP organic and combined pro forma unaudited information to include the effects on our consolidated financial statements of our acquisition of Cartiva, as if the Cartiva acquisition had been completed as of December 26, 2016, the beginning of Wright's fiscal year 2017. The organic net sales reflect net sales by the legacy Wright business, which do not include net sales of products obtained through the Cartiva acquisition. The pro forma net sales have been adjusted to reflect the effect on our combined net sales of incremental revenues that would have been recognized had Cartiva been acquired on December 26, 2016. The Cartiva acquisition only affected the U.S. and international lower extremities product lines net sales. The non-GAAP organic and combined pro forma net sales have been developed based on available information and upon assumptions that our management believes are reasonable in order to reflect, on a pro forma basis, the impact of the Cartiva acquisition.\nThe non-GAAP organic and pro forma financial data is not necessarily indicative of results of operations that would have occurred had the Cartiva acquisition been consummated on December 26, 2016, the first day of the 2017 fiscal year, or which might be attained in the future.\nFinancial Highlights. Net sales increased 10.1% totaling $920.9 million in 2019, compared to $836.2 million in 2018, driven primarily by 13.3% growth in our U.S. net sales.\nOur U.S. net sales increased $82.8 million, or 13.3%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The ongoing launch of our AEQUALIS\u2122 FLEX REVIVE\u2122 revision shoulder system and continued success of the combination of our BLUEPRINT\u2122 enabling technology, AEQUALIS\u2122 PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System and SIMPLICITI\u00ae shoulder system contributed to non-GAAP, legacy Wright U.S. organic growth of 10.8%. The impact to our U.S. net sales from the Cartiva SCI was approximately $25.7 million. Our combined non-GAAP pro forma growth was 9.1% due to a reduction in Cartiva sales as the U.S. Cartiva business was transitioned to our direct U.S. lower extremities sales force during the third quarter of 2019.\nOur international net sales increased $2.0 million, or 0.9%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, driven by Cartiva net sales of $4.1 million and an increase in our direct markets in our international upper extremities business. This increase was offset by a $9.0 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates.\nIn 2019, our net loss from continuing operations totaled $92.1 million, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $169.3 million for 2018. This decrease in net loss from continuing operations was primarily driven by a decrease in other expense, net as 2018 included a $39.9 million charge for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount associated with the extinguishment of $400.0 million of the 2020 Notes and a $35.9 million loss for the net mark-to-market adjustments on our derivative assets and liabilities.\nOpportunities and Challenges. On November 4, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement with Stryker and its subsidiary, Stryker B.V. pursuant to which, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Stryker B.V. commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Wright for $30.75 per share, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes, in cash.\nWe intend to continue to focus on leveraging the global strengths of our product brands as a pure-play extremities and biologics business. Additionally, we believe the highly complementary nature of our businesses gives us significant diversity and scale across a range of geographies and product categories. We were delighted to add Cartiva's SCI, the first and only PMA product for the treatment of great toe osteoarthritis, to our market-leading lower extremities portfolio in October 2018. Supported by compelling clinical performance and backed by Level I clinical evidence, we believe Cartiva is well positioned for future growth as it addresses large markets with significant unmet needs and strong patient demand. As of August 1, 2019, the U.S. Cartiva business was transitioned to our direct U.S. lower extremities sales force.\nFurther, we believe our December 2017 acquisition of IMASCAP, a leader in the development of software-based solutions for preoperative planning of shoulder replacement surgery, ensures exclusive access to breakthrough software enabling technology and patents, including BLUEPRINT\u2122, to further differentiate our product portfolio and to further accelerate growth opportunities in our global extremities business. BLUEPRINT\u2122 is proving to be integral to our ability to convert competitive surgeons, and we believe that impact will increase as we execute our plans to make the system easier to use and release additional enhancements. As of December 29, 2019, approximately 40% of our U.S. shoulder customers are using BLUEPRINT\u2122.\nWe believe we have significant opportunity to increase sales with the recent and anticipated launch of new products, including our AEQUALIS\u2122 PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System, AEQUALIS\u2122 FLEX REVIVE\u2122 revision shoulder system, our PROstep\u2122 Minimally Invasive Surgery system, AUGMENT\u00ae Injectable, and through driving BLUEPRINT\u2122 adoption and by focusing on implementing initiatives to help us better compete at ambulatory surgery centers.\nSignificant Industry Factors. Our industry is affected by numerous competitive, regulatory, and other significant factors. The growth of our business relies on our ability to continue to develop new products and innovative technologies, obtain regulatory clearance and maintain compliance for our products, protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes, manufacture our products cost-effectively and on a timely basis to meet demand, respond to competitive pressures specific to each of our geographic markets, including our ability to enforce non-compete agreements, and successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner. We, and the entire industry, are subject to extensive governmental regulation. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We, as well as other participants in our industry, are subject to product liability claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nResults of Operations\nThe discussion below is on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise noted.\nComparison of the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 to the fiscal year ended

U.S. net sales totaled $706.3 million in 2019, a 13.3% increase from $623.5 million in 2018, primarily due to continued growth in our U.S. upper extremities business. Additionally, we had $25.7 million of net sales from Cartiva. We had non-GAAP organic growth of 10.8% along with non-GAAP combined pro forma growth of 9.1%.\nU.S. sales represented approximately 76.7% of total net sales in 2019, compared to 74.6% of total net sales in 2018.\nOur U.S. lower extremities net sales increased to $276.8 million in 2019 compared to $250.7 million in 2018, representing growth of 10.4%. This growth was primarily driven by Cartiva net sales of approximately $25.7 million. Our non-GAAP organic net sales of U.S. lower extremities increased 3.9%, which was in line with our expectations and primarily driven by 11% net sales growth in our total ankle replacement products, partially offset by flat performance in our core foot products. We believe our U.S. lower extremities business made good progress in bringing the U.S. lower extremities sales force back to full strength in the second half of 2019, filling our open territories with experienced foot and ankle reps, and we noted an improved growth rate in the fourth quarter for our total ankle products and our core foot and ankle products. We expect it will continue to take some time for the full benefits of these actions to be evident in our sales results.\nOur U.S. upper extremities net sales increased to $329.8 million in 2019 from $281.3 million in 2018, representing growth of 17.2%. This growth was driven by the ongoing launch of our AEQUALIS\u2122 FLEX REVIVE\u2122 revision shoulder system and continued success of the combination of our BLUEPRINT\u2122 enabling technology, AEQUALIS\u2122 PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System and SIMPLICITI\u00ae shoulder system.\nOur U.S. biologics net sales totaled $91.5 million in 2019, up from $83.1 million in 2018, representing a 10.1% increase over 2018. This increase was driven by net sales volume growth of AUGMENT\u00ae Injectable, which launched at the end of the second quarter of 2018 after receiving FDA approval, and in our core biologics products.\nInternational net sales. Net sales in our international regions totaled $214.6 million in 2019, compared to $212.7 million in 2018. This 0.9% increase was primarily driven by incremental Cartiva net sales and an increase in our direct markets in our international upper extremities business. These increases were offset by a $9.0 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 4 percentage point unfavorable impact to international sales growth rate).\nOur international lower extremities net sales increased 4.8% to $63.6 million in 2019 from $60.7 million in 2018. Sales increased primarily due to $4.1 million in Cartiva net sales. Non-GAAP organic international lower extremities sales decreased 1.5%, mostly due to a $2.4 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 4 percentage point unfavorable impact to international lower extremities sales growth rate). This unfavorable impact was partially offset by increased sales volumes to our distributor markets.\nOur international upper extremities net sales increased 3.4% to $118.4 million in 2019 from $114.5 million in 2018. Sales increased by a combined 8.5% in our direct markets. These increases were partially offset by a $5.5 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 5 percentage point unfavorable impact to international upper extremities sales growth rate).\nOur international biologics net sales decreased 14.5% to $22.0 million in 2019 from $25.8 million in 2018, due to timing of sales to stocking distributors and a $0.7 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 3 percentage point unfavorable impact to international biologics sales growth rate).\nCost of sales\nOur cost of sales totaled $188.6 million, or 20.5% of net sales, in 2019, compared to $180.2 million, or 21.5% of net sales, in 2018. Our 2019 cost of sales included a $5.2 million favorable adjustment as a result of our change in accounting estimate of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, as such inventory was sold (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of change in our estimate). Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales further decreased as a percentage of sales due to favorable manufacturing expenses and increased gross margins from Cartiva net sales, partially offset by inventory step-up amortization.\nOur cost of sales and corresponding gross profit percentages can be expected to fluctuate in future periods depending upon, among other factors, changes in our product sales mix and prices, distribution channels and geographies, manufacturing yields, period expenses, levels of production volume, and currency exchange rates.\nSelling, general and administrative\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $614.7 million, or 66.7% of net sales, in 2019, compared to $578.0 million, or 69.1% of net sales, in 2018. In 2019, selling, general and administrative expenses included transaction and transition costs of $5.8 million, or 0.6% of net sales, and a non-cash asset impairment associated with the technology transfer of $5.6 million, or 0.6% of net sales. In 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses included transaction and transition cost of $7.6 million, or 0.9% of net sales. The remaining selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 3 percentage points primarily due to leveraging certain general and administrative expenses over increased net sales.\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to decrease as a percentage of net sales in 2020 through opportunities to continue to improve efficiency and leverage our fixed expenses as we expect net sales to continue to increase at a higher rate than expenses.\nResearch and development\nOur investment in research and development expense totaled $74.1 million, or 8.0% of net sales, in 2019 compared to $59.1 million, or 7.1% of net sales, in 2018. Research and development costs increased 1 percentage point primarily due to investments in our new product pipeline.\nOur research and development expenses are estimated to range from 7% to 8% as a percentage of net sales in 2020.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nCharges associated with amortization of intangible assets totaled $31.9 million in 2019 compared to $26.7 million in 2018. Based on intangible assets held at December 29, 2019, we expect amortization expense to be between $27 million and $31 million per year for the years 2020 through 2024.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net, totaled $80.8 million in 2019 and $80.2 million in 2018. Increased interest expense in 2019 related primarily to non-cash interest expense associated with the amortization of the discount on the 2023 Notes, 2021 Notes, and 2020 Notes of $23.5 million, $22.0 million, and $3.8 million, respectively; amortization of deferred financing charges on our borrowings totaling $5.2 million; and cash interest expense totaling $29.0 million primarily associated with the 2023 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2020 Notes, and borrowings under our ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility, partially offset by interest income of $2.6 million.\nOur interest expense in 2018 related primarily to non-cash interest expense associated with the amortization of the discount on the 2023 Notes, 2021 Notes, and 2020 Notes of $10.1 million, $20.0 million, and $19.1 million, respectively; amortization of deferred financing charges totaling $5.4 million; and cash interest expense totaling $28.3 million primarily associated with the 2023 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2020 Notes, and borrowings under our ABL Facility and the 2021 Term Loan Facility. Our interest expense was partially offset by interest income of $2.7 million as result of the investment of the net proceeds from the 2023 Notes issued in the second quarter of 2018.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net totaled $9.9 million in 2019, compared to $81.8 million of other expense, net in 2018. In 2019, other expense, net, consisted primarily of a loss of $14.3 million on the exchange of the cash convertible notes, primarily due to settlement of related conversion derivative liabilities; and a $9.5 million loss related to fair value adjustments to contingent consideration; partially offset by a $11.0 million gain related to mark-to-market adjustments on derivative assets and liabilities; and a net gain on investments of $3.3 million. In 2018, other expense, net, consisted primarily of a $39.9 million charge for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount associated with the extinguishment of $400.0 million of the 2020 Notes; a $35.9 million loss for the net mark-to-market adjustments on our derivative assets and liabilities; a $3.2 million loss from foreign currency translation; and a $1.8 million loss on fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, including mark-to-market adjustments on CVRs issued in connection with the BioMimetic acquisition.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\nWe recorded a tax provision of $13.0 million in 2019 and a tax benefit of $0.5 million in 2018. During 2019, our effective tax rate was approximately (16.4)%, as compared to 0.3% in 2018. Our 2019 net tax provision includes an approximately $10.0 million tax provision due to a change in tax rates on income from deferred intercompany transactions and tax provision on net earnings in jurisdictions where we do not have a valuation allowance offset by a tax benefit for foreign currency losses. Our 2018 tax benefit included an approximately $3.6 million tax benefit recorded due to a change in our valuation allowance as a result of the Cartiva acquisition, a tax provision of $2.7 million due to a change in judgment regarding our ability to realize certain foreign deferred tax assets, and a $0.2 million U.S. tax benefit within continuing operations as a result of the pre-tax gain within discontinued operations. These amounts were offset by income tax provision for net income earned in jurisdictions where we do not have a valuation allowance.\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax, consists primarily of the costs associated with legal defense, income/loss associated with product liability insurance recoveries/denials, and changes to any contingent liabilities associated with the OrthoRecon business that was sold to MicroPort. Our loss from discontinued operations for the fiscal years ended 2019 and 2018 was net of $18.5 million in insurance recoveries recognized in 2019 and a $30.75 million insurance recovery recognized in 2018. See Note 4 and Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion regarding our discontinued operations and our retained contingent liabilities associated with the OrthoRecon business.\nReportable segments\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, net sales and operating income (loss) of our reportable segments expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands) and as a percentage of net sales:\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal year ended December 29, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Lower Extremities\n& Biologics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Upper Extremities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International Extremities\n& Biologics\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>371,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>334,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>214,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,895\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss) as a percent of net sales\n</td> <td>27.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal year ended December 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Lower Extremities\n& Biologics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Upper Extremities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International Extremities\n& Biologics\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>286,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income as a percent of net sales\n</td> <td>28.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales of our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment increased $34.4 million in 2019 over the prior year. Operating income of our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment increased $7.7 million in 2019 over the prior year. These increases to both net sales and operating income were driven primarily by net sales from Cartiva, as well as net sales growth from our INFINITY\u00ae total ankle replacement products, our core lower extremities and biologics businesses, and AUGMENT\u00ae Injectable, which received FDA approval in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in operating income was partially offset by investments in our lower extremities sales force. The Cartiva acquisition had an impact of approximately $16.6 million on net sales for our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment in 2019 over the prior year. The Cartiva acquisition had an impact of approximately $15.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 on operating income for our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment.\nNet sales of our U.S. upper extremities segment increased $48.4 million in 2019 over the prior year. Operating income of our U.S. upper extremities segment increased $25.9 million in 2019 over the prior year. These increases to both net sales and operating income were primarily driven by continued net sales growth within our innovative shoulder product portfolio, including the combination of our AEQUALIS\u2122 PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System, SIMPLICITI\u00ae shoulder system, and BLUEPRINT\u2122 enabling technology, the ongoing launch of our AEQUALIS\u2122 FLEX REVIVE\u2122 revision shoulder system, and leveraging certain selling, general and administrative expenses over increased net sales.\nNet sales of our International extremities and biologics segment increased $2.0 million in 2019 over the prior year. This increase to net sales was primarily due to incremental Cartiva net sales in our international lower extremities business and growth in direct market sales in our international upper extremities business. The Cartiva acquisition had an impact of approximately $3.8 million on net sales for our International extremities and biologics segment in 2019 over the prior year. This increase was mostly offset by unfavorable impacts from foreign currency exchange rates. International extremities and biologics segment had an operating loss of $1.9 million during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared to $1.5 million of operating income for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, resulting in a $3.4 million decrease in operating income (loss). This decrease was primarily due to spending associated with the new European Medical Device Regulation (MDR). These impacts were partially offset by the operating income from the Cartiva acquisition which totaled $3.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019.\nComparison of the fiscal year ended

U.S. net sales totaled $623.5 million in 2018, a 12.4% increase from $554.5 million in 2017, primarily due to continued growth in our U.S. upper extremities business. Additionally, our U.S. lower extremities business had strong sales growth due to continued growth in both our core products and total ankle as well as $9.2 million of net sales from Cartiva. These increases were partially offset by four fewer selling days in 2018, the impact of which we estimate to be approximately $9.0 million. U.S. sales represented approximately 74.6% of total net sales in 2018, compared to 74.4% of total net sales in 2017.\nOur U.S. lower extremities net sales increased to $250.7 million in 2018 compared to $228.0 million in 2017, representing growth of 10.0%. This growth was driven by a 15% growth in our INFINITY\u00ae total ankle replacement products and net sales growth in our core lower extremities business primarily due to increased contributions from our expanded sales organization. Additionally, the impact from Cartiva revenue was approximately $9.2 million. These increases were partially offset by the impact of four fewer selling days in 2018.\nOur U.S. upper extremities net sales increased to $281.3 million in 2018 from $240.0 million in 2017, representing growth of 17.2%. This growth was driven by our innovative shoulder product portfolio, including the ongoing launch of our AEQUALIS\u00ae PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System, continued contributions from our SIMPLICITI\u00ae shoulder system, and accelerating adoption of our BLUEPRINT\u2122 enabling technology. These increases were partially offset by the impact of four fewer selling days in 2018.\nOur U.S. biologics net sales totaled $83.1 million in 2018, up from $78.4 million in 2017, representing a 6.0% increase over 2017. This increase was driven by net sales volume growth in our core biologics products and AUGMENT\u00ae Injectable, which launched at the end of the second quarter of 2018 after receiving FDA approval. These increases were partially offset by the impact of four fewer selling days in 2018.\nInternational net sales. Net sales in our international regions totaled $212.7 million in 2018, compared to $190.5 million in 2017. This 11.6% increase was primarily due to continued growth in our upper extremities business in both our direct and indirect markets. We also had a $4.8 million favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 3 percentage point favorable impact international sales growth rate).\nOur international lower extremities net sales increased 3.9% to $60.7 million in 2018 from $58.5 million in 2017 primarily due to increased sales volumes to our distributor markets and a $1.3 million favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 2 percentage point favorable impact to international lower extremities sales growth rate).\nOur international upper extremities net sales increased 20.9% to $114.5 million in 2018 from $94.7 million in 2017 due to a 12.9% increase in sales in our direct markets and significant increased sales volume to our distributor markets. The majority of our direct\nmarkets experienced significant growth during 2018. We also had a $3.1 million favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 3 percentage point favorable impact to international upper extremities sales growth rate).\nOur international biologics net sales increased 15.6% to $25.8 million in 2018 from $22.3 million in 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to increased sales volumes to our distributor markets. The net impact from foreign currency exchange rates was immaterial.\nCost of sales\nOur cost of sales totaled $180.2 million, or 21.5% of net sales, in 2018, compared to $160.9 million, or 21.6% of net sales, in 2017. Our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales remained relatively constant as favorable manufacturing expenses were offset by unfavorable changes in customer and geographical mix.\nSelling, general and administrative\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $578.0 million, or 69.1% of net sales, in 2018, compared to $525.2 million, or 70.5% of net sales, in 2017. In 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses included transaction and transition costs of $7.6 million, or 0.9% of net sales. In 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses included transaction and transition cost of $9.0 million, or 1.2% of net sales, offset by a benefit from incentive and indirect tax projects of $9.0 million, or 1.2% of net sales. The remaining selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 2.3 percentage points due to leveraging corporate and certain U.S. selling, general and administrative expenses over increased net sales, partially offset by higher levels of cash incentive compensation expense and non-cash share-based compensation expense.\nResearch and development\nOur investment in research and development expense totaled $59.1 million in 2018 compared to $50.1 million in 2017. Research and development costs remained constant at approximately 7% of net sales.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nCharges associated with amortization of intangible assets totaled $26.7 million in 2018 compared to $28.4 million in 2017.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net, totaled $80.2 million in 2018 and $74.6 million in 2017. Increased interest expense was driven by the increase in debt outstanding following the issuance of the 2023 Notes in the second quarter of 2018 and the 2021 Term Loan Facility that was established during the second quarter of 2018 (see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of changes in our outstanding debt).\nOur interest expense in 2018 related primarily to non-cash interest expense associated with the amortization of the discount on the 2023 Notes, 2021 Notes, and 2020 Notes of $10.1 million, $20.0 million, and $19.1 million, respectively; amortization of deferred financing charges totaling $5.4 million; and cash interest expense totaling $28.3 million primarily associated with the 2023 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2020 Notes, and borrowings under our ABL Facility and the 2021 Term Loan Facility. Our interest expense was partially offset by interest income of $2.7 million as result of the investment of the net proceeds from the 2023 Notes issued in the second quarter of 2018. Our interest expense in 2017 related primarily to non-cash interest expense associated with the amortization of the discount on the 2021 Notes and 2020 Notes of $18.1 million and $27.3 million, respectively; amortization of deferred financing charges totaling $4.9 million; and cash interest expense primarily associated with the coupon on the 2021 Notes, 2020 Notes, 2017 Notes, and our ABL Facility totaling $23.5 million. An insignificant amount of interest income was recorded during 2017.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net was $81.8 million of expense in 2018, compared to $5.6 million of expense in 2017.\nIn 2018, other expense, net, primarily consisted of:\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $39.9 million charge for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount associated with the extinguishment of $400.0 million of the 2020 Notes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $35.9 million loss for the net mark-to-market adjustments on our derivative assets and liabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $3.2 million loss from foreign currency translation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $1.8 million loss on fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, including mark-to-market adjustments on CVRs issued in connection with the BioMimetic acquisition.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In 2017, other income, net, primarily consisted of:\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $4.5 million loss on currency translation, including hedging activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $5.3 million loss for the mark-to-market adjustment on CVRs; partially offset by\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $4.8 million gain for the net mark-to-market adjustments on our derivative assets and liabilities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a benefit of $0.6 million related to incentive and indirect tax projects.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Benefit for income taxes\nWe recorded a tax benefit of $0.5 million in 2018 and $35.0 million in 2017. During 2018, our effective tax rate was approximately 0.3%, as compared to 35.0% in 2017. Our 2018 net tax benefit included an approximately $3.6 million tax benefit recorded due to a change in our valuation allowance as a result of the Cartiva acquisition, a tax provision of $2.7 million due to a change in judgment regarding our ability to realize certain foreign deferred tax assets, and a $0.2 million U.S. tax benefit within continuing operations as a result of the pre-tax gain within discontinued operations. These amounts were offset by income tax provision for net income earned in jurisdictions where we do not have a valuation allowance. Our 2017 tax benefit included approximately $25.0 million recorded due to a change in our valuation allowance with respect to certain deferred tax assets that we had previously determined were not more-likely-than-not to be realized and a $8.3 million benefit resulting primarily from the effects of lower statutory tax rates and provisions regarding certain tax attributes resulting from tax reform legislation enacted in the United States and France. The remaining tax benefit in 2017 was primarily related to losses, including amortization of intangible assets, in jurisdictions where we do not have a valuation allowance.\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax\nFor the fiscal years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, totaled $0.2 million and $137.7 million, respectively. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, consists primarily of costs associated with legal defense, income/loss associated with product liability insurance recoveries/denials, and changes to any contingent liabilities associated with the OrthoRecon business that was sold to MicroPort.\nIn 2018, charges associated with product liability claims from the OrthoRecon business were fully offset by insurance recoveries. During the fiscal year ended 2017, the majority of our loss from discontinued operations was the result of our retained metal-on-metal product liability claims.\nSee Note 4 and Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion regarding our discontinued operations and our retained contingent liabilities associated with the OrthoRecon business.\nReportable segments\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, net sales and operating income of our reportable segments expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands) and as a percentage of net sales:\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal year ended December 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Lower Extremities\n& Biologics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Upper Extremities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International Extremities\n& Biologics\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>286,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>96,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income as a percent of net sales\n</td> <td>28.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal year ended December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Lower Extremities\n& Biologics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Upper Extremities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International Extremities\n& Biologics\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>79,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income as a percent of net sales\n</td> <td>25.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales of our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment increased $27.7 million in 2018 over the prior year. Operating income of our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment increased $16.3 million in 2018 over the prior year. These increases to both net sales and operating income were driven primarily by net sales growth from our total ankle replacement products, our core lower extremities and biologics businesses, AUGMENT\u00ae Injectable, which received FDA approval in the second quarter of 2018, and leveraging certain selling, general and administrative expenses over increased net sales. Additionally, the impact from the Cartiva acquisition had an impact of approximately $9.2 million and $4.3 million on sales and operating income, respectively, for our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment.\nNet sales of our U.S. upper extremities segment increased $41.3 million in 2018 over the prior year. Operating income of our U.S. upper extremities segment increased $18.8 million in 2018 over the prior year. These increases to both net sales and operating income were primarily driven by net sales growth within our innovative shoulder product portfolio, including continued success of our AEQUALIS\u2122 PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System and our SIMPLICITI\u00ae shoulder system, and leveraging certain selling, general and administrative expenses over increased net sales.\nNet sales of our International extremities and biologics segment increased $22.2 million in 2018 over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to increased sales in our direct markets in Europe and Canada, with continued growth in our international upper extremities business. Operating income of our International extremities and biologics segment decreased $2.1 million in 2018 over the prior year, primarily due to investments made in sales and marketing in our direct markets, as well as spending associated with the new European MDR.\nSeasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations\nWe traditionally experience lower sales volumes in the third quarter than throughout the rest of the year as many of our products are used in elective procedures, which generally decline during the summer months. This typically results in selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales that are higher during this period than throughout the rest of the year.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience meaningful variability in our net sales and cost of sales as a percentage of net sales among quarters, as well as within each quarter, as a result of a number of factors including, among other things, the number and mix of products sold in the quarter and the geographies in which they are sold; the demand for, and pricing of our products and the products of our competitors; the timing of or failure to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for products; costs, benefits, and timing of new product introductions; the level of competition; the timing and extent of promotional pricing or volume discounts; changes in average selling prices; the availability and cost of components and materials; number of selling days; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the timing of patients' use of their calendar year medical insurance deductibles; and impairment and other special charges.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain liquidity measures (in thousands):\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>191,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital (deficit) 1, 2\n</td> <td>(106,350\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________________\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>As of December 29, 2019, the sale price condition (as defined within Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8.

As a result, the carrying value of the 2021 Notes was classified as a current liability as of December 29, 2019.

The 2020 Notes were classified as a current liability as of December 29, 2019 as they matured on February 15, 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Operating activities. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities totaled $41.6 million, $(63.7) million, and $(184.8) million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily driven by improved cash profitability of continuing operations and lower levels of cash paid on contingent consideration and product liabilities associated with discontinued operations. During 2018, we paid $42.0 million upon reaching the CVR product sales milestone payment associated with sales for AUGMENT\u00ae Bone Graft and $88.6 million for discontinued operations as compared to $52.6 million for discontinued operations in 2019 (see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of product liability claims and insurance recoveries).\nThe decrease in cash used in operating activities in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to lower levels of cash settlements for product liability claims associated with discontinued operations. Cash used in discontinued operations totaled $88.6 million and $228.1 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively (see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of product liability settlement liabilities and insurance\nrecoveries), as well as improved cash profitability of continuing operations, partially offset by the 2018 payment of $42.0 million upon reaching the CVR product sales milestone payment associated with sales for AUGMENT\u00ae Bone Graft.\nInvesting activities. Our capital expenditures totaled $99.3 million in 2019, $71.5 million in 2018, and $63.5 million in 2017. This increase is primarily due to increased investments in surgical instrumentation to support the continued rollouts and upcoming product launches in our upper extremities business, as well as increased investments in computer systems. In 2019, we also incurred approximately $14 million for the purchase and set up of a 40,000 square foot state of the art manufacturing and distribution facility in Arlington, Tennessee.\nIn addition to capital expenditures, during 2018, the majority of our cash used in investing activities was associated with the acquisition of Cartiva for $434.3 million, net of cash acquired. Additionally, during 2017, we paid $44.1 million in conjunction with the IMASCAP acquisition, net of cash acquired. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding these acquisitions.\nFinancing activities. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $37.4 million, $598.1 million, and $46.8 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2019 was primarily attributable to $52.1 million in cash received from the issuance of ordinary shares in connection with option exercises. These proceeds were partially offset by $6.4 million of net payments related to the exchange of 2023 Notes for 2020 Notes (as further described below) and the associated issuance of additional 2023 Notes Hedges and warrants and settlement of pro rata portions of the 2020 Notes Hedges and warrants.\nOn February 7, 2019, WMG issued $139.6 million of additional 2023 Notes in exchange for $130.1 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Notes. As this was a debt modification, a pro rata share of the 2020 Notes deferred financing costs and discount was transferred to the 2023 Notes deferred financing costs and discount. Additionally, the 2023 Notes discount was adjusted in order for net debt to remain the same subsequent to the exchange. While the debt modification was a non-cash transaction, we paid approximately $3.0 million of debt modification costs.\nAdditionally, on January 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019, we, along with WMG, entered into cash-settled convertible note hedge transactions with certain option counterparties. WMG paid approximately $30.1 million in the aggregate to the option counterparties for the note hedge transactions, and received approximately $21.2 million in the aggregate from the option counterparties for the warrants, resulting in a net cost to us of approximately $8.9 million. In connection with the above described exchange, WMG also settled a pro rata share of the 2020 Notes Hedges and warrants corresponding to the amount of 2020 Notes exchanged pursuant to this transaction. We received proceeds of approximately $16.8 million related to the 2020 Notes Hedges and paid $11.0 million related to the 2020 Warrants, generating net proceeds of $5.8 million.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2018 was primarily attributable to the net cash proceeds received from the registered equity offering and 2023 Notes issuance. During August 2018, we entered into an underwriting agreement with J.P. Morgan, relating to a registered public offering of our ordinary shares. The discounted proceeds to Wright for the equity offering to fund the Cartiva acquisition were $448.9 million. Payments of equity offering costs were $25.9 million during 2018. Proceeds were subsequently used in October 2018 to fund the $435.0 million purchase price of Cartiva.\nDuring June 2018, we issued $675.0 million of 2023 Notes, settled $400.9 million of 2020 Notes, and paid a premium of $55.6 million on the 2020 Notes. We also paid $141.3 million for hedges associated with the 2023 Notes and received approximately $102.1 million for the issuance of warrants associated with the 2023 Notes. As part of the 2023 Notes issuance, Term Loan Facility and 2023 warrants, we paid $14.7 million for deferred financing costs. Other debt proceeds were primarily made up of the Term Loan Facility which were used to pay down a portion of the asset-based line of credit under the ABL Facility. In July 2018, we settled a pro rata share of the 2020 Notes hedges and 2020 warrants which resulted in net proceeds of $10.6 million.\nDuring 2018, we also received $21.6 million of cash from the issuance of ordinary shares in connection with option exercises under our share-based compensation plans.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2017 was primarily attributable to $34.9 million of debt proceeds largely from additional borrowings from the ABL Facility and $27.6 million of cash from the issuance of ordinary shares in connection with option exercises under our share-based compensation plans. This was partially offset by $11.5 million of debt payments including a $2.0 million payment of the 2017 Notes and net payments due to the weekly lockbox repayment/re-borrowing arrangement underlying the ABL Facility.\nRepatriation. As of December 29, 2019, approximately $0.5 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held by certain U.S.-controlled non-U.S. subsidiaries which may not represent available liquidity for general corporate purposes. Our current plans do not foresee a need to repatriate funds that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations or meet currently anticipated liquidity and capital investment needs.\nDiscontinued operations. Cash flows from discontinued operations are combined with cash flows from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash used in discontinued operations totaled $52.6 million, $88.6 million, and $228.1\nmillion for the years ended December 29, 2019, December 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively, and primarily related to payments of retained product liability claims from the OrthoRecon business. We do not expect that the future cash outflows from discontinued operations, including the payment of these retained liabilities of the OrthoRecon business, will have an impact on our ability to meet contractual cash obligations and fund our working capital requirements, operations, and anticipated capital expenditures.\nContractual cash obligations. At December 29, 2019, we had contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as follows (in thousands):\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by periods\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Contractual obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year 4, 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts reflected in consolidated balance sheet:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance lease obligations 1\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases obligations 1\n</td> <td>24,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable 2\n</td> <td>1,313,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>474,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>814,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts not reflected in consolidated balance sheet:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum supply obligations\n</td> <td>44,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on notes payable 3\n</td> <td>70,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,480,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>521,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>850,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>Payments include amounts representing interest.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2\n</td> <td>Our notes payable include 2020 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2023 Notes, ABL Facility, ABL Term Loan Facility, and other debt.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations describes the principal factors affecting the results of our operations, financial condition, and changes in financial condition, as well as our critical accounting estimates.\nOn November 4, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement with Stryker and its subsidiary, Stryker B.V. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Stryker B.V. has commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Wright for $30.75 per share, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes, in cash. The offer is currently scheduled to expire at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on February 27, 2020, but may be extended in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement between Stryker and Wright. The closing of the transaction is subject to receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, the adoption of certain resolutions relating to the transaction at an extraordinary general meeting of Wright's shareholders, completion of the tender offer, and other customary closing conditions.\nOn August 24, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the outstanding equity on a fully diluted basis of Cartiva, an orthopaedic medical device company focused on treatment of osteoarthritis of the great toe, for a total price of $435.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the agreement. On October 10, 2018, we completed the acquisition, which added a differentiated PMA approved technology for a high-volume foot and ankle procedure and further accelerated growth opportunities in our global extremities business. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional details related to the Cartiva acquisition. We funded the Cartiva acquisition with the proceeds from a registered underwritten public offering of 18.2 million ordinary shares which resulted in net proceeds of $423.0 million. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional details related to the public offering.\nOn January 9, 2014, legacy Wright completed the sale of its former OrthoRecon business to MicroPort. The financial results of the OrthoRecon business are reflected within discontinued operations for all periods presented, unless otherwise noted.\nAll current and historical operating results for the OrthoRecon business is reflected within discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements.\nOther than the discontinued operations discussed in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d, unless otherwise stated, all discussion of assets and liabilities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in this section, reflects the assets and liabilities held and used in our continuing operations, and all discussion of revenues and expenses reflects those associated with our continuing operations.\nReferences in this section to we,\u201d our\u201d and us\u201d refer to Wright Medical Group N.V. and its subsidiaries after the Wright/Tornier merger and Wright Medical Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries before the merger. Our fiscal year-end is generally determined on a 52-week basis and runs from the Monday nearest to the 31st of December of a year, and ends on the Sunday nearest to the 31st of December of the following year. Every few years, it is necessary to add an extra week to the year making it a 53-week period. The fiscal years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 were 52-week periods. The fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 was a 53-week period. References in this report to a particular year generally refer to the applicable fiscal year. Accordingly, references to 2019\u201d or the year ended December 29, 2019\u201d mean the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019.\nExecutive Overview\nCompany Description. We are a global medical device company focused on extremities and biologics products. We are committed to delivering innovative, value-added solutions improving quality of life for patients worldwide and are a recognized leader of\nsurgical solutions for the upper extremities (shoulder, elbow, wrist and hand), lower extremities (foot and ankle) and biologics markets, three of the fastest growing segments in orthopaedics.\nOur global corporate headquarters are located in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We also have significant operations located in Memphis, Tennessee (U.S. headquarters, research and development, sales and marketing administration, and administrative activities); Bloomington, Minnesota (upper extremities sales and marketing and warehousing operations); Arlington, Tennessee (manufacturing and warehousing operations); Franklin, Tennessee (manufacturing and warehousing operations); Columbia City, Indiana (research and development); Alpharetta, Georgia (manufacturing and warehousing operations); Montbonnot, France (manufacturing and warehousing operations); Plouzan\u00e9, France (research and development); and Macroom, Ireland (manufacturing). In addition, we have local sales and distribution offices in Canada, Australia, Asia, Latin America, and throughout Europe.\nWe offer a broad product portfolio of approximately 150 extremities products and approximately 20 biologics products that are designed to provide solutions to our surgeon customers, with the goal of improving clinical outcomes and the quality of life\u201d for their patients. Our product portfolio consists of the following product categories:\n \u2022 Upper extremities, which include joint implants and bone fixation devices for the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand; \n \u2022 Lower extremities, which include joint implants and bone fixation devices for the foot and ankle; \n \u2022 Biologics, which include products used to support treatment of damaged or diseased bone, tendons, and soft tissues or to stimulate bone growth; and \n \u2022 Sports medicine and other, which include products used across several anatomic sites to mechanically repair tissue-to-tissue or tissue-to-bone injuries and other ancillary products.  Our sales and distribution system in the United States currently consists of 80 geographic sales territories that are staffed by over 500 direct sales representatives and 29 independent sales agencies or distributors. These sales representatives and independent sales agencies and distributors are generally aligned to selling either our upper extremities products or lower extremities products, but, in some cases, certain agencies or direct sales representatives sell products from both our upper and lower extremities product portfolios in their territories. Internationally, we utilize several distribution approaches that are tailored to the needs and requirements of each individual market. Our international sales and distribution system currently consists of 13 direct sales offices and approximately 90 distributors that sell our products in approximately 50 countries, with principal markets outside the United States in Europe, Asia, Canada, Australia, and Latin America. Our U.S. sales accounted for 76.7% and 74.6% of total net sales for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nPrincipal Products. We have focused our efforts into growing our position in the high-growth extremities and biologics markets. We believe a more active and aging patient population with higher expectations regarding quality of life,\u201d an increasing global awareness of extremities and biologics solutions, improved clinical outcomes as a result of the use of such products, and technological advances resulting in specific designs for such products that simplify procedures and address unmet needs for early interventions, and the growing need for revisions and revision-related solutions will drive the market for extremities and biologics products.\nThe extremities market is one of the fastest growing market segments within orthopaedics, with annual growth rates of 7-10%. We believe major trends in the extremities market include procedure-specific and anatomy-specific devices, locking plates, and an increase in total ankle replacement or arthroplasty procedures. Upper extremities reconstruction involves implanting devices to replace, reconstruct, or fixate injured or diseased joints and bones in the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand. It is estimated that approximately 60% of the upper extremities market is in total shoulder replacement or arthroplasty implants. We believe major trends in the upper extremities market include next-generation joint arthroplasty systems, bone preserving solutions, virtual planning systems, and revision of failed previous shoulder replacements in older patients. Lower extremities reconstruction involves implanting devices to replace, reconstruct, or fixate injured or diseased joints and bones in the foot and ankle. A large segment of the lower extremities market is comprised of plating and screw systems for reconstructing and fusing joints or repairing bones after traumatic injury. We believe major trends in the lower extremities market include the use of external fixation devices in diabetic patients, total ankle arthroplasty, advanced tissue fixation devices, virtual planning systems, and biologics. New technologies have been introduced into the lower extremities market in recent years, including next-generation total ankle replacement systems.\nOur principal upper extremities products include the AEQUALIS ASCEND\u00ae FLEX\u2122 convertible shoulder system and SIMPLICITI\u00ae total shoulder replacement system, AEQUALIS\u00ae PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System, and the AEQUALIS\u00ae REVERSED II\u2122 reversed shoulder system. SIMPLICITI\u00ae is the first minimally invasive, canal sparing total shoulder available in the United States. We believe SIMPLICITI\u00ae allows us to expand the market to include younger patients that historically have deferred these procedures. Our BLUEPRINT\u2122 3D Planning Software can be used with our products to assist surgeons in accurately positioning the glenoid and humeral implants and replicating the pre-operative surgical plan. Other principal upper extremities products include the EVOLVE\u00ae radial head prosthesis for elbow fractures, the EVOLVE\u00ae Elbow Plating System, and the\nRAYHACK\u00ae osteotomy system. FDA 510(k) clearance of the AEQUALIS\u00ae FLEX REVIVE\u2122 revision shoulder system was received in the third quarter of 2018. AEQUALIS\u00ae FLEX REVIVE\u2122 was launched to limited users early in the first quarter of 2019 and was fully launched at the end of the second quarter of 2019.\nOur principal lower extremities products include the INBONE\u00ae, INFINITY\u00ae, and INVISION\u2122 Total Ankle Replacement systems, all of which can be used with our PROPHECY\u00ae Preoperative Navigation Guides, which combine computer imaging with a patient's CT scan, and are designed to provide alignment accuracy while reducing surgical steps. As a result of our October 2018 acquisition of Cartiva, our lower extremities product portfolio includes Cartiva's Synthetic Cartilage Implant (SCI), the only PMA approved product for treatment of first Metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint osteoarthritis. Our lower extremities products also include the Salvation external fixation system for the treatment of Charcot diabetic foot, the CLAW\u00ae II Polyaxial Compression Plating System, the ORTHOLOC\u2122 3Di Reconstruction Plating System, the PHALINX\u00ae system used for hammertoe indications, PRO-TOE\u00ae VO Hammertoe System, the VALOR\u00ae ankle fusion nail system, and the Swanson line of toe joint replacement products. The PROstep\u2122 Minimally Invasive Surgery system for foot and ankle was launched to limited users in the third quarter of 2017, and was fully launched early in the third quarter of 2018. We also launched a number of line extensions to the SALVATION\u2122 limb salvage portfolio in 2018. We expect continued demand for these new products.\nThe field of biologics employs tissue engineering and regenerative medicine technologies focused on remodeling and regeneration of tendons, ligaments, bone, and cartilage. Biologic products use both biological tissue-based and synthetic materials to allow the body to regenerate damaged or diseased bone and to repair damaged or diseased soft tissue. These products aid the body's natural regenerative capabilities to heal itself. Biologic products provide a lower morbidity solution to autografting,\u201d a procedure that involves harvesting a patient's own bone or soft tissue and transplanting it to a different site. Following an autografting procedure, the patient typically has pain and, at times, complications result at the harvest site after surgery. Biologically or synthetically derived soft tissue grafts and scaffolds are used to treat soft tissue injuries and are complementary to many sports medicine applications, including rotator cuff tendon repair and Achilles tendon repair. Hard tissue biologics products are used in many bone fusion or trauma cases where healing potential may be compromised and additional biologic factors are desired to enhance healing, where the surgeon needs additional bone, or in cases where the surgeon wishes to use materials that are naturally incorporated by the body over time. We estimate that the worldwide orthobiologics market to be over $3.7 billion, and with annual growth rates of 3-4%. Three multinational companies currently dominate the orthobiologics industry.\nOur biologic products use both biological tissue-based and synthetic materials to allow the body to regenerate damaged or diseased bone and to repair damaged or diseased soft tissue. Our principal biologic products include AUGMENT\u00ae Bone Graft and AUGMENT\u00ae Injectable. AUGMENT\u00ae is based on recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (rhPDGF-BB), a synthetic copy of one of the body's principal healing agents. Other principal biologics products include the GRAFTJACKET\u00ae and GRAFTJACKET NOW\u2122 lines of soft tissue repair and containment membranes, the ACTISHIELD\u2122 and VIAFLOW\u2122 products which are derived from amniotic and placental tissues, the ALLOMATRIX\u00ae line of injectable tissue-based bone graft substitutes, the PRO-DENSE\u00ae Injectable Graft, the OSTEOSET\u00ae synthetic bone graft substitute, and the PRO-STIM\u00ae Injectable Inductive Graft. Additionally, we introduced BIOSKIN\u00ae Amniotic Wound Matrix in the third quarter of 2019 to address chronic wounds treated by surgical podiatrists.\nSignificant Business Developments. On November 4, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement with Stryker and its subsidiary, Stryker B.V. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Stryker B.V. has commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Wright for $30.75 per share, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes, in cash. The offer is currently scheduled to expire at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on February 27, 2020, but may be extended in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement between Stryker and Wright. The closing of the transaction is subject to receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, the adoption of certain resolutions relating to the transaction at an extraordinary general meeting of Wright's shareholders, completion of the tender offer, and other customary closing conditions.\nOn February 25, 2019, we amended the Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement dated December 23, 2016 with Midcap Financial Trust, as administrative agent and a lender and the additional lenders from time to time party thereto, to, among other things, increase the amount of commitments under the line of credit from $150 million to $175 million and under the second tranche of the term loan facility from $20 million to $35 million.\nDuring February 2019, we issued $139.6 million of additional 2023 Notes and settled $130.1 million of 2020 Notes. We paid approximately $30.1 million for additional 2023 Notes Hedges, and received approximately $21.2 million for additional 2023 warrants, resulting in a net cost to us of approximately $8.9 million. In connection with the above described exchange, we also settled a pro rata share of the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivatives, 2020 Notes Hedges, and warrants corresponding to the amount of 2020 Notes exchanged pursuant to this exchange. We received proceeds of approximately $16.8 million related to the 2020 Notes Hedges and paid $11.0 million related to the 2020 Warrants, generating net proceeds of $5.8 million.\nSupplemental Non-GAAP Pro Forma Information. Due to the significance of the Cartiva business that is not included in our results of operations for the year ended December 30, 2018 and to supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including organic and combined pro forma net sales.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive or standard set of accounting rules or principles. Accordingly, the calculation of our non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the definitions of other companies using the same or similar names limiting, to some extent, the usefulness of such measures for comparison purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. See tables below for a reconciliation of our non-GAAP organic and combined pro forma net sales for the years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 to our net sales for such periods as calculated in accordance with US GAAP.\nThe Results of Operations\u201d discussion that appears below has been presented utilizing a combination of historical unaudited and, where relevant, non-GAAP organic and combined pro forma unaudited information to include the effects on our consolidated financial statements of our acquisition of Cartiva, as if the Cartiva acquisition had been completed as of December 26, 2016, the beginning of Wright's fiscal year 2017. The organic net sales reflect net sales by the legacy Wright business, which do not include net sales of products obtained through the Cartiva acquisition. The pro forma net sales have been adjusted to reflect the effect on our combined net sales of incremental revenues that would have been recognized had Cartiva been acquired on December 26, 2016. The Cartiva acquisition only affected the U.S. and international lower extremities product lines net sales. The non-GAAP organic and combined pro forma net sales have been developed based on available information and upon assumptions that our management believes are reasonable in order to reflect, on a pro forma basis, the impact of the Cartiva acquisition.\nThe non-GAAP organic and pro forma financial data is not necessarily indicative of results of operations that would have occurred had the Cartiva acquisition been consummated on December 26, 2016, the first day of the 2017 fiscal year, or which might be attained in the future.\nFinancial Highlights. Net sales increased 10.1% totaling $920.9 million in 2019, compared to $836.2 million in 2018, driven primarily by 13.3% growth in our U.S. net sales.\nOur U.S. net sales increased $82.8 million, or 13.3%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The ongoing launch of our AEQUALIS\u2122 FLEX REVIVE\u2122 revision shoulder system and continued success of the combination of our BLUEPRINT\u2122 enabling technology, AEQUALIS\u2122 PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System and SIMPLICITI\u00ae shoulder system contributed to non-GAAP, legacy Wright U.S. organic growth of 10.8%. The impact to our U.S. net sales from the Cartiva SCI was approximately $25.7 million. Our combined non-GAAP pro forma growth was 9.1% due to a reduction in Cartiva sales as the U.S. Cartiva business was transitioned to our direct U.S. lower extremities sales force during the third quarter of 2019.\nOur international net sales increased $2.0 million, or 0.9%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, driven by Cartiva net sales of $4.1 million and an increase in our direct markets in our international upper extremities business. This increase was offset by a $9.0 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates.\nIn 2019, our net loss from continuing operations totaled $92.1 million, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $169.3 million for 2018. This decrease in net loss from continuing operations was primarily driven by a decrease in other expense, net as 2018 included a $39.9 million charge for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount associated with the extinguishment of $400.0 million of the 2020 Notes and a $35.9 million loss for the net mark-to-market adjustments on our derivative assets and liabilities.\nOpportunities and Challenges. On November 4, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement with Stryker and its subsidiary, Stryker B.V. pursuant to which, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Stryker B.V. commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Wright for $30.75 per share, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes, in cash.\nWe intend to continue to focus on leveraging the global strengths of our product brands as a pure-play extremities and biologics business. Additionally, we believe the highly complementary nature of our businesses gives us significant diversity and scale across a range of geographies and product categories. We were delighted to add Cartiva's SCI, the first and only PMA product for the treatment of great toe osteoarthritis, to our market-leading lower extremities portfolio in October 2018. Supported by compelling clinical performance and backed by Level I clinical evidence, we believe Cartiva is well positioned for future growth as it addresses large markets with significant unmet needs and strong patient demand. As of August 1, 2019, the U.S. Cartiva business was transitioned to our direct U.S. lower extremities sales force.\nFurther, we believe our December 2017 acquisition of IMASCAP, a leader in the development of software-based solutions for preoperative planning of shoulder replacement surgery, ensures exclusive access to breakthrough software enabling technology and patents, including BLUEPRINT\u2122, to further differentiate our product portfolio and to further accelerate growth opportunities in our global extremities business. BLUEPRINT\u2122 is proving to be integral to our ability to convert competitive surgeons, and we believe that impact will increase as we execute our plans to make the system easier to use and release additional enhancements. As of December 29, 2019, approximately 40% of our U.S. shoulder customers are using BLUEPRINT\u2122.\nWe believe we have significant opportunity to increase sales with the recent and anticipated launch of new products, including our AEQUALIS\u2122 PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System, AEQUALIS\u2122 FLEX REVIVE\u2122 revision shoulder system, our PROstep\u2122 Minimally Invasive Surgery system, AUGMENT\u00ae Injectable, and through driving BLUEPRINT\u2122 adoption and by focusing on implementing initiatives to help us better compete at ambulatory surgery centers.\nSignificant Industry Factors. Our industry is affected by numerous competitive, regulatory, and other significant factors. The growth of our business relies on our ability to continue to develop new products and innovative technologies, obtain regulatory clearance and maintain compliance for our products, protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes, manufacture our products cost-effectively and on a timely basis to meet demand, respond to competitive pressures specific to each of our geographic markets, including our ability to enforce non-compete agreements, and successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner. We, and the entire industry, are subject to extensive governmental regulation. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We, as well as other participants in our industry, are subject to product liability claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nResults of Operations\nThe discussion below is on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise noted.\nComparison of the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 to the fiscal year ended

U.S. net sales totaled $706.3 million in 2019, a 13.3% increase from $623.5 million in 2018, primarily due to continued growth in our U.S. upper extremities business. Additionally, we had $25.7 million of net sales from Cartiva. We had non-GAAP organic growth of 10.8% along with non-GAAP combined pro forma growth of 9.1%.\nU.S. sales represented approximately 76.7% of total net sales in 2019, compared to 74.6% of total net sales in 2018.\nOur U.S. lower extremities net sales increased to $276.8 million in 2019 compared to $250.7 million in 2018, representing growth of 10.4%. This growth was primarily driven by Cartiva net sales of approximately $25.7 million. Our non-GAAP organic net sales of U.S. lower extremities increased 3.9%, which was in line with our expectations and primarily driven by 11% net sales growth in our total ankle replacement products, partially offset by flat performance in our core foot products. We believe our U.S. lower extremities business made good progress in bringing the U.S. lower extremities sales force back to full strength in the second half of 2019, filling our open territories with experienced foot and ankle reps, and we noted an improved growth rate in the fourth quarter for our total ankle products and our core foot and ankle products. We expect it will continue to take some time for the full benefits of these actions to be evident in our sales results.\nOur U.S. upper extremities net sales increased to $329.8 million in 2019 from $281.3 million in 2018, representing growth of 17.2%. This growth was driven by the ongoing launch of our AEQUALIS\u2122 FLEX REVIVE\u2122 revision shoulder system and continued success of the combination of our BLUEPRINT\u2122 enabling technology, AEQUALIS\u2122 PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System and SIMPLICITI\u00ae shoulder system.\nOur U.S. biologics net sales totaled $91.5 million in 2019, up from $83.1 million in 2018, representing a 10.1% increase over 2018. This increase was driven by net sales volume growth of AUGMENT\u00ae Injectable, which launched at the end of the second quarter of 2018 after receiving FDA approval, and in our core biologics products.\nInternational net sales. Net sales in our international regions totaled $214.6 million in 2019, compared to $212.7 million in 2018. This 0.9% increase was primarily driven by incremental Cartiva net sales and an increase in our direct markets in our international upper extremities business. These increases were offset by a $9.0 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 4 percentage point unfavorable impact to international sales growth rate).\nOur international lower extremities net sales increased 4.8% to $63.6 million in 2019 from $60.7 million in 2018. Sales increased primarily due to $4.1 million in Cartiva net sales. Non-GAAP organic international lower extremities sales decreased 1.5%, mostly due to a $2.4 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 4 percentage point unfavorable impact to international lower extremities sales growth rate). This unfavorable impact was partially offset by increased sales volumes to our distributor markets.\nOur international upper extremities net sales increased 3.4% to $118.4 million in 2019 from $114.5 million in 2018. Sales increased by a combined 8.5% in our direct markets. These increases were partially offset by a $5.5 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 5 percentage point unfavorable impact to international upper extremities sales growth rate).\nOur international biologics net sales decreased 14.5% to $22.0 million in 2019 from $25.8 million in 2018, due to timing of sales to stocking distributors and a $0.7 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 3 percentage point unfavorable impact to international biologics sales growth rate).\nCost of sales\nOur cost of sales totaled $188.6 million, or 20.5% of net sales, in 2019, compared to $180.2 million, or 21.5% of net sales, in 2018. Our 2019 cost of sales included a $5.2 million favorable adjustment as a result of our change in accounting estimate of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, as such inventory was sold (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of change in our estimate). Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales further decreased as a percentage of sales due to favorable manufacturing expenses and increased gross margins from Cartiva net sales, partially offset by inventory step-up amortization.\nOur cost of sales and corresponding gross profit percentages can be expected to fluctuate in future periods depending upon, among other factors, changes in our product sales mix and prices, distribution channels and geographies, manufacturing yields, period expenses, levels of production volume, and currency exchange rates.\nSelling, general and administrative\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $614.7 million, or 66.7% of net sales, in 2019, compared to $578.0 million, or 69.1% of net sales, in 2018. In 2019, selling, general and administrative expenses included transaction and transition costs of $5.8 million, or 0.6% of net sales, and a non-cash asset impairment associated with the technology transfer of $5.6 million, or 0.6% of net sales. In 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses included transaction and transition cost of $7.6 million, or 0.9% of net sales. The remaining selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 3 percentage points primarily due to leveraging certain general and administrative expenses over increased net sales.\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to decrease as a percentage of net sales in 2020 through opportunities to continue to improve efficiency and leverage our fixed expenses as we expect net sales to continue to increase at a higher rate than expenses.\nResearch and development\nOur investment in research and development expense totaled $74.1 million, or 8.0% of net sales, in 2019 compared to $59.1 million, or 7.1% of net sales, in 2018. Research and development costs increased 1 percentage point primarily due to investments in our new product pipeline.\nOur research and development expenses are estimated to range from 7% to 8% as a percentage of net sales in 2020.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nCharges associated with amortization of intangible assets totaled $31.9 million in 2019 compared to $26.7 million in 2018. Based on intangible assets held at December 29, 2019, we expect amortization expense to be between $27 million and $31 million per year for the years 2020 through 2024.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net, totaled $80.8 million in 2019 and $80.2 million in 2018. Increased interest expense in 2019 related primarily to non-cash interest expense associated with the amortization of the discount on the 2023 Notes, 2021 Notes, and 2020 Notes of $23.5 million, $22.0 million, and $3.8 million, respectively; amortization of deferred financing charges on our borrowings totaling $5.2 million; and cash interest expense totaling $29.0 million primarily associated with the 2023 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2020 Notes, and borrowings under our ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility, partially offset by interest income of $2.6 million.\nOur interest expense in 2018 related primarily to non-cash interest expense associated with the amortization of the discount on the 2023 Notes, 2021 Notes, and 2020 Notes of $10.1 million, $20.0 million, and $19.1 million, respectively; amortization of deferred financing charges totaling $5.4 million; and cash interest expense totaling $28.3 million primarily associated with the 2023 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2020 Notes, and borrowings under our ABL Facility and the 2021 Term Loan Facility. Our interest expense was partially offset by interest income of $2.7 million as result of the investment of the net proceeds from the 2023 Notes issued in the second quarter of 2018.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net totaled $9.9 million in 2019, compared to $81.8 million of other expense, net in 2018. In 2019, other expense, net, consisted primarily of a loss of $14.3 million on the exchange of the cash convertible notes, primarily due to settlement of related conversion derivative liabilities; and a $9.5 million loss related to fair value adjustments to contingent consideration; partially offset by a $11.0 million gain related to mark-to-market adjustments on derivative assets and liabilities; and a net gain on investments of $3.3 million. In 2018, other expense, net, consisted primarily of a $39.9 million charge for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount associated with the extinguishment of $400.0 million of the 2020 Notes; a $35.9 million loss for the net mark-to-market adjustments on our derivative assets and liabilities; a $3.2 million loss from foreign currency translation; and a $1.8 million loss on fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, including mark-to-market adjustments on CVRs issued in connection with the BioMimetic acquisition.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\nWe recorded a tax provision of $13.0 million in 2019 and a tax benefit of $0.5 million in 2018. During 2019, our effective tax rate was approximately (16.4)%, as compared to 0.3% in 2018. Our 2019 net tax provision includes an approximately $10.0 million tax provision due to a change in tax rates on income from deferred intercompany transactions and tax provision on net earnings in jurisdictions where we do not have a valuation allowance offset by a tax benefit for foreign currency losses. Our 2018 tax benefit included an approximately $3.6 million tax benefit recorded due to a change in our valuation allowance as a result of the Cartiva acquisition, a tax provision of $2.7 million due to a change in judgment regarding our ability to realize certain foreign deferred tax assets, and a $0.2 million U.S. tax benefit within continuing operations as a result of the pre-tax gain within discontinued operations. These amounts were offset by income tax provision for net income earned in jurisdictions where we do not have a valuation allowance.\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax, consists primarily of the costs associated with legal defense, income/loss associated with product liability insurance recoveries/denials, and changes to any contingent liabilities associated with the OrthoRecon business that was sold to MicroPort. Our loss from discontinued operations for the fiscal years ended 2019 and 2018 was net of $18.5 million in insurance recoveries recognized in 2019 and a $30.75 million insurance recovery recognized in 2018. See Note 4 and Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion regarding our discontinued operations and our retained contingent liabilities associated with the OrthoRecon business.\nReportable segments\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, net sales and operating income (loss) of our reportable segments expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands) and as a percentage of net sales:\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal year ended December 29, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Lower Extremities\n& Biologics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Upper Extremities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International Extremities\n& Biologics\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>371,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>334,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>214,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,895\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss) as a percent of net sales\n</td> <td>27.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal year ended December 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Lower Extremities\n& Biologics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Upper Extremities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International Extremities\n& Biologics\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>286,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income as a percent of net sales\n</td> <td>28.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales of our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment increased $34.4 million in 2019 over the prior year. Operating income of our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment increased $7.7 million in 2019 over the prior year. These increases to both net sales and operating income were driven primarily by net sales from Cartiva, as well as net sales growth from our INFINITY\u00ae total ankle replacement products, our core lower extremities and biologics businesses, and AUGMENT\u00ae Injectable, which received FDA approval in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in operating income was partially offset by investments in our lower extremities sales force. The Cartiva acquisition had an impact of approximately $16.6 million on net sales for our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment in 2019 over the prior year. The Cartiva acquisition had an impact of approximately $15.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 on operating income for our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment.\nNet sales of our U.S. upper extremities segment increased $48.4 million in 2019 over the prior year. Operating income of our U.S. upper extremities segment increased $25.9 million in 2019 over the prior year. These increases to both net sales and operating income were primarily driven by continued net sales growth within our innovative shoulder product portfolio, including the combination of our AEQUALIS\u2122 PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System, SIMPLICITI\u00ae shoulder system, and BLUEPRINT\u2122 enabling technology, the ongoing launch of our AEQUALIS\u2122 FLEX REVIVE\u2122 revision shoulder system, and leveraging certain selling, general and administrative expenses over increased net sales.\nNet sales of our International extremities and biologics segment increased $2.0 million in 2019 over the prior year. This increase to net sales was primarily due to incremental Cartiva net sales in our international lower extremities business and growth in direct market sales in our international upper extremities business. The Cartiva acquisition had an impact of approximately $3.8 million on net sales for our International extremities and biologics segment in 2019 over the prior year. This increase was mostly offset by unfavorable impacts from foreign currency exchange rates. International extremities and biologics segment had an operating loss of $1.9 million during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared to $1.5 million of operating income for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, resulting in a $3.4 million decrease in operating income (loss). This decrease was primarily due to spending associated with the new European Medical Device Regulation (MDR). These impacts were partially offset by the operating income from the Cartiva acquisition which totaled $3.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019.\nComparison of the fiscal year ended

U.S. net sales totaled $623.5 million in 2018, a 12.4% increase from $554.5 million in 2017, primarily due to continued growth in our U.S. upper extremities business. Additionally, our U.S. lower extremities business had strong sales growth due to continued growth in both our core products and total ankle as well as $9.2 million of net sales from Cartiva. These increases were partially offset by four fewer selling days in 2018, the impact of which we estimate to be approximately $9.0 million. U.S. sales represented approximately 74.6% of total net sales in 2018, compared to 74.4% of total net sales in 2017.\nOur U.S. lower extremities net sales increased to $250.7 million in 2018 compared to $228.0 million in 2017, representing growth of 10.0%. This growth was driven by a 15% growth in our INFINITY\u00ae total ankle replacement products and net sales growth in our core lower extremities business primarily due to increased contributions from our expanded sales organization. Additionally, the impact from Cartiva revenue was approximately $9.2 million. These increases were partially offset by the impact of four fewer selling days in 2018.\nOur U.S. upper extremities net sales increased to $281.3 million in 2018 from $240.0 million in 2017, representing growth of 17.2%. This growth was driven by our innovative shoulder product portfolio, including the ongoing launch of our AEQUALIS\u00ae PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System, continued contributions from our SIMPLICITI\u00ae shoulder system, and accelerating adoption of our BLUEPRINT\u2122 enabling technology. These increases were partially offset by the impact of four fewer selling days in 2018.\nOur U.S. biologics net sales totaled $83.1 million in 2018, up from $78.4 million in 2017, representing a 6.0% increase over 2017. This increase was driven by net sales volume growth in our core biologics products and AUGMENT\u00ae Injectable, which launched at the end of the second quarter of 2018 after receiving FDA approval. These increases were partially offset by the impact of four fewer selling days in 2018.\nInternational net sales. Net sales in our international regions totaled $212.7 million in 2018, compared to $190.5 million in 2017. This 11.6% increase was primarily due to continued growth in our upper extremities business in both our direct and indirect markets. We also had a $4.8 million favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 3 percentage point favorable impact international sales growth rate).\nOur international lower extremities net sales increased 3.9% to $60.7 million in 2018 from $58.5 million in 2017 primarily due to increased sales volumes to our distributor markets and a $1.3 million favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 2 percentage point favorable impact to international lower extremities sales growth rate).\nOur international upper extremities net sales increased 20.9% to $114.5 million in 2018 from $94.7 million in 2017 due to a 12.9% increase in sales in our direct markets and significant increased sales volume to our distributor markets. The majority of our direct\nmarkets experienced significant growth during 2018. We also had a $3.1 million favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 3 percentage point favorable impact to international upper extremities sales growth rate).\nOur international biologics net sales increased 15.6% to $25.8 million in 2018 from $22.3 million in 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to increased sales volumes to our distributor markets. The net impact from foreign currency exchange rates was immaterial.\nCost of sales\nOur cost of sales totaled $180.2 million, or 21.5% of net sales, in 2018, compared to $160.9 million, or 21.6% of net sales, in 2017. Our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales remained relatively constant as favorable manufacturing expenses were offset by unfavorable changes in customer and geographical mix.\nSelling, general and administrative\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $578.0 million, or 69.1% of net sales, in 2018, compared to $525.2 million, or 70.5% of net sales, in 2017. In 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses included transaction and transition costs of $7.6 million, or 0.9% of net sales. In 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses included transaction and transition cost of $9.0 million, or 1.2% of net sales, offset by a benefit from incentive and indirect tax projects of $9.0 million, or 1.2% of net sales. The remaining selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 2.3 percentage points due to leveraging corporate and certain U.S. selling, general and administrative expenses over increased net sales, partially offset by higher levels of cash incentive compensation expense and non-cash share-based compensation expense.\nResearch and development\nOur investment in research and development expense totaled $59.1 million in 2018 compared to $50.1 million in 2017. Research and development costs remained constant at approximately 7% of net sales.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nCharges associated with amortization of intangible assets totaled $26.7 million in 2018 compared to $28.4 million in 2017.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net, totaled $80.2 million in 2018 and $74.6 million in 2017. Increased interest expense was driven by the increase in debt outstanding following the issuance of the 2023 Notes in the second quarter of 2018 and the 2021 Term Loan Facility that was established during the second quarter of 2018 (see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of changes in our outstanding debt).\nOur interest expense in 2018 related primarily to non-cash interest expense associated with the amortization of the discount on the 2023 Notes, 2021 Notes, and 2020 Notes of $10.1 million, $20.0 million, and $19.1 million, respectively; amortization of deferred financing charges totaling $5.4 million; and cash interest expense totaling $28.3 million primarily associated with the 2023 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2020 Notes, and borrowings under our ABL Facility and the 2021 Term Loan Facility. Our interest expense was partially offset by interest income of $2.7 million as result of the investment of the net proceeds from the 2023 Notes issued in the second quarter of 2018. Our interest expense in 2017 related primarily to non-cash interest expense associated with the amortization of the discount on the 2021 Notes and 2020 Notes of $18.1 million and $27.3 million, respectively; amortization of deferred financing charges totaling $4.9 million; and cash interest expense primarily associated with the coupon on the 2021 Notes, 2020 Notes, 2017 Notes, and our ABL Facility totaling $23.5 million. An insignificant amount of interest income was recorded during 2017.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net was $81.8 million of expense in 2018, compared to $5.6 million of expense in 2017.\nIn 2018, other expense, net, primarily consisted of:\n \u2022 a $39.9 million charge for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount associated with the extinguishment of $400.0 million of the 2020 Notes; \n \u2022 a $35.9 million loss for the net mark-to-market adjustments on our derivative assets and liabilities; \n \u2022 a $3.2 million loss from foreign currency translation; and \n \u2022 a $1.8 million loss on fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, including mark-to-market adjustments on CVRs issued in connection with the BioMimetic acquisition.  In 2017, other income, net, primarily consisted of:\n \u2022 a $4.5 million loss on currency translation, including hedging activities; \n \u2022 a $5.3 million loss for the mark-to-market adjustment on CVRs; partially offset by \n \u2022 a $4.8 million gain for the net mark-to-market adjustments on our derivative assets and liabilities; and \n \u2022 a benefit of $0.6 million related to incentive and indirect tax projects.  Benefit for income taxes\nWe recorded a tax benefit of $0.5 million in 2018 and $35.0 million in 2017. During 2018, our effective tax rate was approximately 0.3%, as compared to 35.0% in 2017. Our 2018 net tax benefit included an approximately $3.6 million tax benefit recorded due to a change in our valuation allowance as a result of the Cartiva acquisition, a tax provision of $2.7 million due to a change in judgment regarding our ability to realize certain foreign deferred tax assets, and a $0.2 million U.S. tax benefit within continuing operations as a result of the pre-tax gain within discontinued operations. These amounts were offset by income tax provision for net income earned in jurisdictions where we do not have a valuation allowance. Our 2017 tax benefit included approximately $25.0 million recorded due to a change in our valuation allowance with respect to certain deferred tax assets that we had previously determined were not more-likely-than-not to be realized and a $8.3 million benefit resulting primarily from the effects of lower statutory tax rates and provisions regarding certain tax attributes resulting from tax reform legislation enacted in the United States and France. The remaining tax benefit in 2017 was primarily related to losses, including amortization of intangible assets, in jurisdictions where we do not have a valuation allowance.\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax\nFor the fiscal years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, totaled $0.2 million and $137.7 million, respectively. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, consists primarily of costs associated with legal defense, income/loss associated with product liability insurance recoveries/denials, and changes to any contingent liabilities associated with the OrthoRecon business that was sold to MicroPort.\nIn 2018, charges associated with product liability claims from the OrthoRecon business were fully offset by insurance recoveries. During the fiscal year ended 2017, the majority of our loss from discontinued operations was the result of our retained metal-on-metal product liability claims.\nSee Note 4 and Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion regarding our discontinued operations and our retained contingent liabilities associated with the OrthoRecon business.\nReportable segments\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, net sales and operating income of our reportable segments expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands) and as a percentage of net sales:\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal year ended December 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Lower Extremities\n& Biologics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Upper Extremities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International Extremities\n& Biologics\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>286,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>96,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income as a percent of net sales\n</td> <td>28.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal year ended December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Lower Extremities\n& Biologics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Upper Extremities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International Extremities\n& Biologics\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>79,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income as a percent of net sales\n</td> <td>25.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales of our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment increased $27.7 million in 2018 over the prior year. Operating income of our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment increased $16.3 million in 2018 over the prior year. These increases to both net sales and operating income were driven primarily by net sales growth from our total ankle replacement products, our core lower extremities and biologics businesses, AUGMENT\u00ae Injectable, which received FDA approval in the second quarter of 2018, and leveraging certain selling, general and administrative expenses over increased net sales. Additionally, the impact from the Cartiva acquisition had an impact of approximately $9.2 million and $4.3 million on sales and operating income, respectively, for our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment.\nNet sales of our U.S. upper extremities segment increased $41.3 million in 2018 over the prior year. Operating income of our U.S. upper extremities segment increased $18.8 million in 2018 over the prior year. These increases to both net sales and operating income were primarily driven by net sales growth within our innovative shoulder product portfolio, including continued success of our AEQUALIS\u2122 PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System and our SIMPLICITI\u00ae shoulder system, and leveraging certain selling, general and administrative expenses over increased net sales.\nNet sales of our International extremities and biologics segment increased $22.2 million in 2018 over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to increased sales in our direct markets in Europe and Canada, with continued growth in our international upper extremities business. Operating income of our International extremities and biologics segment decreased $2.1 million in 2018 over the prior year, primarily due to investments made in sales and marketing in our direct markets, as well as spending associated with the new European MDR.\nSeasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations\nWe traditionally experience lower sales volumes in the third quarter than throughout the rest of the year as many of our products are used in elective procedures, which generally decline during the summer months. This typically results in selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales that are higher during this period than throughout the rest of the year.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience meaningful variability in our net sales and cost of sales as a percentage of net sales among quarters, as well as within each quarter, as a result of a number of factors including, among other things, the number and mix of products sold in the quarter and the geographies in which they are sold; the demand for, and pricing of our products and the products of our competitors; the timing of or failure to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for products; costs, benefits, and timing of new product introductions; the level of competition; the timing and extent of promotional pricing or volume discounts; changes in average selling prices; the availability and cost of components and materials; number of selling days; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the timing of patients' use of their calendar year medical insurance deductibles; and impairment and other special charges.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain liquidity measures (in thousands):\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>191,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital (deficit) 1, 2\n</td> <td>(106,350\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________________\n 1 As of December 29, 2019, the sale price condition (as defined within Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d) for the 2021 Notes was satisfied and, therefore, the 2021 Notes are convertible at any time during the succeeding quarterly period. As a result, the carrying value of the 2021 Notes was classified as a current liability as of December 29, 2019. The respective balances were classified as long-term as of December 30, 2018. \n 2 The holders of the 2020 Notes may convert their notes at any time on or after August 15, 2019. Due to the ability of the holders of the 2020 Notes to convert their notes within the next year, the carrying value of the 2020 Notes was classified as a current liability as of December 30, 2018. The 2020 Notes were classified as a current liability as of December 29, 2019 as they matured on February 15, 2020.  Operating activities. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities totaled $41.6 million, $(63.7) million, and $(184.8) million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily driven by improved cash profitability of continuing operations and lower levels of cash paid on contingent consideration and product liabilities associated with discontinued operations. During 2018, we paid $42.0 million upon reaching the CVR product sales milestone payment associated with sales for AUGMENT\u00ae Bone Graft and $88.6 million for discontinued operations as compared to $52.6 million for discontinued operations in 2019 (see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of product liability claims and insurance recoveries).\nThe decrease in cash used in operating activities in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to lower levels of cash settlements for product liability claims associated with discontinued operations. Cash used in discontinued operations totaled $88.6 million and $228.1 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively (see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of product liability settlement liabilities and insurance\nrecoveries), as well as improved cash profitability of continuing operations, partially offset by the 2018 payment of $42.0 million upon reaching the CVR product sales milestone payment associated with sales for AUGMENT\u00ae Bone Graft.\nInvesting activities. Our capital expenditures totaled $99.3 million in 2019, $71.5 million in 2018, and $63.5 million in 2017. This increase is primarily due to increased investments in surgical instrumentation to support the continued rollouts and upcoming product launches in our upper extremities business, as well as increased investments in computer systems. In 2019, we also incurred approximately $14 million for the purchase and set up of a 40,000 square foot state of the art manufacturing and distribution facility in Arlington, Tennessee.\nIn addition to capital expenditures, during 2018, the majority of our cash used in investing activities was associated with the acquisition of Cartiva for $434.3 million, net of cash acquired. Additionally, during 2017, we paid $44.1 million in conjunction with the IMASCAP acquisition, net of cash acquired. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding these acquisitions.\nFinancing activities. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $37.4 million, $598.1 million, and $46.8 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2019 was primarily attributable to $52.1 million in cash received from the issuance of ordinary shares in connection with option exercises. These proceeds were partially offset by $6.4 million of net payments related to the exchange of 2023 Notes for 2020 Notes (as further described below) and the associated issuance of additional 2023 Notes Hedges and warrants and settlement of pro rata portions of the 2020 Notes Hedges and warrants.\nOn February 7, 2019, WMG issued $139.6 million of additional 2023 Notes in exchange for $130.1 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Notes. As this was a debt modification, a pro rata share of the 2020 Notes deferred financing costs and discount was transferred to the 2023 Notes deferred financing costs and discount. Additionally, the 2023 Notes discount was adjusted in order for net debt to remain the same subsequent to the exchange. While the debt modification was a non-cash transaction, we paid approximately $3.0 million of debt modification costs.\nAdditionally, on January 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019, we, along with WMG, entered into cash-settled convertible note hedge transactions with certain option counterparties. WMG paid approximately $30.1 million in the aggregate to the option counterparties for the note hedge transactions, and received approximately $21.2 million in the aggregate from the option counterparties for the warrants, resulting in a net cost to us of approximately $8.9 million. In connection with the above described exchange, WMG also settled a pro rata share of the 2020 Notes Hedges and warrants corresponding to the amount of 2020 Notes exchanged pursuant to this transaction. We received proceeds of approximately $16.8 million related to the 2020 Notes Hedges and paid $11.0 million related to the 2020 Warrants, generating net proceeds of $5.8 million.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2018 was primarily attributable to the net cash proceeds received from the registered equity offering and 2023 Notes issuance. During August 2018, we entered into an underwriting agreement with J.P. Morgan, relating to a registered public offering of our ordinary shares. The discounted proceeds to Wright for the equity offering to fund the Cartiva acquisition were $448.9 million. Payments of equity offering costs were $25.9 million during 2018. Proceeds were subsequently used in October 2018 to fund the $435.0 million purchase price of Cartiva.\nDuring June 2018, we issued $675.0 million of 2023 Notes, settled $400.9 million of 2020 Notes, and paid a premium of $55.6 million on the 2020 Notes. We also paid $141.3 million for hedges associated with the 2023 Notes and received approximately $102.1 million for the issuance of warrants associated with the 2023 Notes. As part of the 2023 Notes issuance, Term Loan Facility and 2023 warrants, we paid $14.7 million for deferred financing costs. Other debt proceeds were primarily made up of the Term Loan Facility which were used to pay down a portion of the asset-based line of credit under the ABL Facility. In July 2018, we settled a pro rata share of the 2020 Notes hedges and 2020 warrants which resulted in net proceeds of $10.6 million.\nDuring 2018, we also received $21.6 million of cash from the issuance of ordinary shares in connection with option exercises under our share-based compensation plans.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2017 was primarily attributable to $34.9 million of debt proceeds largely from additional borrowings from the ABL Facility and $27.6 million of cash from the issuance of ordinary shares in connection with option exercises under our share-based compensation plans. This was partially offset by $11.5 million of debt payments including a $2.0 million payment of the 2017 Notes and net payments due to the weekly lockbox repayment/re-borrowing arrangement underlying the ABL Facility.\nRepatriation. As of December 29, 2019, approximately $0.5 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held by certain U.S.-controlled non-U.S. subsidiaries which may not represent available liquidity for general corporate purposes. Our current plans do not foresee a need to repatriate funds that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations or meet currently anticipated liquidity and capital investment needs.\nDiscontinued operations. Cash flows from discontinued operations are combined with cash flows from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash used in discontinued operations totaled $52.6 million, $88.6 million, and $228.1\nmillion for the years ended December 29, 2019, December 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively, and primarily related to payments of retained product liability claims from the OrthoRecon business. We do not expect that the future cash outflows from discontinued operations, including the payment of these retained liabilities of the OrthoRecon business, will have an impact on our ability to meet contractual cash obligations and fund our working capital requirements, operations, and anticipated capital expenditures.\nContractual cash obligations. At December 29, 2019, we had contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as follows (in thousands):\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by periods\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Contractual obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year 4, 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts reflected in consolidated balance sheet:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance lease obligations 1\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases obligations 1\n</td> <td>24,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable 2\n</td> <td>1,313,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>474,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>814,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts not reflected in consolidated balance sheet:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum supply obligations\n</td> <td>44,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on notes payable 3\n</td> <td>70,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,480,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>521,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>850,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________\n 1 Payments include amounts representing interest. \n 2 Our notes payable include 2020 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2023 Notes, ABL Facility, ABL Term Loan Facility, and other debt. See further discussion in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d \n 3 Represents interest on 2020 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2023 Notes, ABL Term Loan Facility, and other debt. See further discussion in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d \n 4 The 2021 Notes will mature on November 15, 2021 unless earlier converted or repurchased. As of December 29, 2019, the sale price condition (as defined in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d) for the 2021 Notes was satisfied and, therefore, the 2021 Notes are convertible at any time during the succeeding quarterly period. As a result, the carrying value of the 2021 Notes was classified as a current liability as of December 29, 2019 and the gross amount of $395.0 million is included in the less than 1 year total above. \n 5 All outstanding loans under the ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility will be due and payable in full on December 23, 2021 or earlier under certain specified circumstances as described in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The less than 1 year total above includes $20.7 million in borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility as this debt is reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 29, 2019 due to the weekly lockbox repayment/re-borrowing arrangement underlying the agreement, as well as the ability for the lenders to accelerate the repayment of the debt under certain circumstances.  The amounts reflected in the table above exclude the following:\n \u2022 product liabilities described in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d \n \u2022 2023, 2021, and 2020 Notes Conversion Derivatives (see", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations describes the principal factors affecting the results of our operations, financial condition, and changes in financial condition, as well as our critical accounting estimates.\nOn November 4, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement with Stryker and its subsidiary, Stryker B.V. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Stryker B.V. has commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Wright for $30.75 per share, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes, in cash. The offer is currently scheduled to expire at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on February 27, 2020, but may be extended in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement between Stryker and Wright. The closing of the transaction is subject to receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, the adoption of certain resolutions relating to the transaction at an extraordinary general meeting of Wright's shareholders, completion of the tender offer, and other customary closing conditions.\nOn August 24, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the outstanding equity on a fully diluted basis of Cartiva, an orthopaedic medical device company focused on treatment of osteoarthritis of the great toe, for a total price of $435.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the agreement. On October 10, 2018, we completed the acquisition, which added a differentiated PMA approved technology for a high-volume foot and ankle procedure and further accelerated growth opportunities in our global extremities business. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional details related to the Cartiva acquisition. We funded the Cartiva acquisition with the proceeds from a registered underwritten public offering of 18.2 million ordinary shares which resulted in net proceeds of $423.0 million. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional details related to the public offering.\nOn January 9, 2014, legacy Wright completed the sale of its former OrthoRecon business to MicroPort. The financial results of the OrthoRecon business are reflected within discontinued operations for all periods presented, unless otherwise noted.\nAll current and historical operating results for the OrthoRecon business is reflected within discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements.\nOther than the discontinued operations discussed in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d, unless otherwise stated, all discussion of assets and liabilities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in this section, reflects the assets and liabilities held and used in our continuing operations, and all discussion of revenues and expenses reflects those associated with our continuing operations.\nReferences in this section to we,\u201d our\u201d and us\u201d refer to Wright Medical Group N.V. and its subsidiaries after the Wright/Tornier merger and Wright Medical Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries before the merger. Our fiscal year-end is generally determined on a 52-week basis and runs from the Monday nearest to the 31st of December of a year, and ends on the Sunday nearest to the 31st of December of the following year. Every few years, it is necessary to add an extra week to the year making it a 53-week period. The fiscal years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 were 52-week periods. The fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 was a 53-week period. References in this report to a particular year generally refer to the applicable fiscal year. Accordingly, references to 2019\u201d or the year ended December 29, 2019\u201d mean the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019.\nExecutive Overview\nCompany Description. We are a global medical device company focused on extremities and biologics products. We are committed to delivering innovative, value-added solutions improving quality of life for patients worldwide and are a recognized leader of\nsurgical solutions for the upper extremities (shoulder, elbow, wrist and hand), lower extremities (foot and ankle) and biologics markets, three of the fastest growing segments in orthopaedics.\nOur global corporate headquarters are located in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We also have significant operations located in Memphis, Tennessee (U.S. headquarters, research and development, sales and marketing administration, and administrative activities); Bloomington, Minnesota (upper extremities sales and marketing and warehousing operations); Arlington, Tennessee (manufacturing and warehousing operations); Franklin, Tennessee (manufacturing and warehousing operations); Columbia City, Indiana (research and development); Alpharetta, Georgia (manufacturing and warehousing operations); Montbonnot, France (manufacturing and warehousing operations); Plouzan\u00e9, France (research and development); and Macroom, Ireland (manufacturing). In addition, we have local sales and distribution offices in Canada, Australia, Asia, Latin America, and throughout Europe.\nWe offer a broad product portfolio of approximately 150 extremities products and approximately 20 biologics products that are designed to provide solutions to our surgeon customers, with the goal of improving clinical outcomes and the quality of life\u201d for their patients. Our product portfolio consists of the following product categories:\n \u2022 Upper extremities, which include joint implants and bone fixation devices for the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand; \n \u2022 Lower extremities, which include joint implants and bone fixation devices for the foot and ankle; \n \u2022 Biologics, which include products used to support treatment of damaged or diseased bone, tendons, and soft tissues or to stimulate bone growth; and \n \u2022 Sports medicine and other, which include products used across several anatomic sites to mechanically repair tissue-to-tissue or tissue-to-bone injuries and other ancillary products.  Our sales and distribution system in the United States currently consists of 80 geographic sales territories that are staffed by over 500 direct sales representatives and 29 independent sales agencies or distributors. These sales representatives and independent sales agencies and distributors are generally aligned to selling either our upper extremities products or lower extremities products, but, in some cases, certain agencies or direct sales representatives sell products from both our upper and lower extremities product portfolios in their territories. Internationally, we utilize several distribution approaches that are tailored to the needs and requirements of each individual market. Our international sales and distribution system currently consists of 13 direct sales offices and approximately 90 distributors that sell our products in approximately 50 countries, with principal markets outside the United States in Europe, Asia, Canada, Australia, and Latin America. Our U.S. sales accounted for 76.7% and 74.6% of total net sales for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nPrincipal Products. We have focused our efforts into growing our position in the high-growth extremities and biologics markets. We believe a more active and aging patient population with higher expectations regarding quality of life,\u201d an increasing global awareness of extremities and biologics solutions, improved clinical outcomes as a result of the use of such products, and technological advances resulting in specific designs for such products that simplify procedures and address unmet needs for early interventions, and the growing need for revisions and revision-related solutions will drive the market for extremities and biologics products.\nThe extremities market is one of the fastest growing market segments within orthopaedics, with annual growth rates of 7-10%. We believe major trends in the extremities market include procedure-specific and anatomy-specific devices, locking plates, and an increase in total ankle replacement or arthroplasty procedures. Upper extremities reconstruction involves implanting devices to replace, reconstruct, or fixate injured or diseased joints and bones in the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand. It is estimated that approximately 60% of the upper extremities market is in total shoulder replacement or arthroplasty implants. We believe major trends in the upper extremities market include next-generation joint arthroplasty systems, bone preserving solutions, virtual planning systems, and revision of failed previous shoulder replacements in older patients. Lower extremities reconstruction involves implanting devices to replace, reconstruct, or fixate injured or diseased joints and bones in the foot and ankle. A large segment of the lower extremities market is comprised of plating and screw systems for reconstructing and fusing joints or repairing bones after traumatic injury. We believe major trends in the lower extremities market include the use of external fixation devices in diabetic patients, total ankle arthroplasty, advanced tissue fixation devices, virtual planning systems, and biologics. New technologies have been introduced into the lower extremities market in recent years, including next-generation total ankle replacement systems.\nOur principal upper extremities products include the AEQUALIS ASCEND\u00ae FLEX\u2122 convertible shoulder system and SIMPLICITI\u00ae total shoulder replacement system, AEQUALIS\u00ae PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System, and the AEQUALIS\u00ae REVERSED II\u2122 reversed shoulder system. SIMPLICITI\u00ae is the first minimally invasive, canal sparing total shoulder available in the United States. We believe SIMPLICITI\u00ae allows us to expand the market to include younger patients that historically have deferred these procedures. Our BLUEPRINT\u2122 3D Planning Software can be used with our products to assist surgeons in accurately positioning the glenoid and humeral implants and replicating the pre-operative surgical plan. Other principal upper extremities products include the EVOLVE\u00ae radial head prosthesis for elbow fractures, the EVOLVE\u00ae Elbow Plating System, and the\nRAYHACK\u00ae osteotomy system. FDA 510(k) clearance of the AEQUALIS\u00ae FLEX REVIVE\u2122 revision shoulder system was received in the third quarter of 2018. AEQUALIS\u00ae FLEX REVIVE\u2122 was launched to limited users early in the first quarter of 2019 and was fully launched at the end of the second quarter of 2019.\nOur principal lower extremities products include the INBONE\u00ae, INFINITY\u00ae, and INVISION\u2122 Total Ankle Replacement systems, all of which can be used with our PROPHECY\u00ae Preoperative Navigation Guides, which combine computer imaging with a patient's CT scan, and are designed to provide alignment accuracy while reducing surgical steps. As a result of our October 2018 acquisition of Cartiva, our lower extremities product portfolio includes Cartiva's Synthetic Cartilage Implant (SCI), the only PMA approved product for treatment of first Metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint osteoarthritis. Our lower extremities products also include the Salvation external fixation system for the treatment of Charcot diabetic foot, the CLAW\u00ae II Polyaxial Compression Plating System, the ORTHOLOC\u2122 3Di Reconstruction Plating System, the PHALINX\u00ae system used for hammertoe indications, PRO-TOE\u00ae VO Hammertoe System, the VALOR\u00ae ankle fusion nail system, and the Swanson line of toe joint replacement products. The PROstep\u2122 Minimally Invasive Surgery system for foot and ankle was launched to limited users in the third quarter of 2017, and was fully launched early in the third quarter of 2018. We also launched a number of line extensions to the SALVATION\u2122 limb salvage portfolio in 2018. We expect continued demand for these new products.\nThe field of biologics employs tissue engineering and regenerative medicine technologies focused on remodeling and regeneration of tendons, ligaments, bone, and cartilage. Biologic products use both biological tissue-based and synthetic materials to allow the body to regenerate damaged or diseased bone and to repair damaged or diseased soft tissue. These products aid the body's natural regenerative capabilities to heal itself. Biologic products provide a lower morbidity solution to autografting,\u201d a procedure that involves harvesting a patient's own bone or soft tissue and transplanting it to a different site. Following an autografting procedure, the patient typically has pain and, at times, complications result at the harvest site after surgery. Biologically or synthetically derived soft tissue grafts and scaffolds are used to treat soft tissue injuries and are complementary to many sports medicine applications, including rotator cuff tendon repair and Achilles tendon repair. Hard tissue biologics products are used in many bone fusion or trauma cases where healing potential may be compromised and additional biologic factors are desired to enhance healing, where the surgeon needs additional bone, or in cases where the surgeon wishes to use materials that are naturally incorporated by the body over time. We estimate that the worldwide orthobiologics market to be over $3.7 billion, and with annual growth rates of 3-4%. Three multinational companies currently dominate the orthobiologics industry.\nOur biologic products use both biological tissue-based and synthetic materials to allow the body to regenerate damaged or diseased bone and to repair damaged or diseased soft tissue. Our principal biologic products include AUGMENT\u00ae Bone Graft and AUGMENT\u00ae Injectable. AUGMENT\u00ae is based on recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (rhPDGF-BB), a synthetic copy of one of the body's principal healing agents. Other principal biologics products include the GRAFTJACKET\u00ae and GRAFTJACKET NOW\u2122 lines of soft tissue repair and containment membranes, the ACTISHIELD\u2122 and VIAFLOW\u2122 products which are derived from amniotic and placental tissues, the ALLOMATRIX\u00ae line of injectable tissue-based bone graft substitutes, the PRO-DENSE\u00ae Injectable Graft, the OSTEOSET\u00ae synthetic bone graft substitute, and the PRO-STIM\u00ae Injectable Inductive Graft. Additionally, we introduced BIOSKIN\u00ae Amniotic Wound Matrix in the third quarter of 2019 to address chronic wounds treated by surgical podiatrists.\nSignificant Business Developments. On November 4, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement with Stryker and its subsidiary, Stryker B.V. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Stryker B.V. has commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Wright for $30.75 per share, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes, in cash. The offer is currently scheduled to expire at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on February 27, 2020, but may be extended in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement between Stryker and Wright. The closing of the transaction is subject to receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, the adoption of certain resolutions relating to the transaction at an extraordinary general meeting of Wright's shareholders, completion of the tender offer, and other customary closing conditions.\nOn February 25, 2019, we amended the Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement dated December 23, 2016 with Midcap Financial Trust, as administrative agent and a lender and the additional lenders from time to time party thereto, to, among other things, increase the amount of commitments under the line of credit from $150 million to $175 million and under the second tranche of the term loan facility from $20 million to $35 million.\nDuring February 2019, we issued $139.6 million of additional 2023 Notes and settled $130.1 million of 2020 Notes. We paid approximately $30.1 million for additional 2023 Notes Hedges, and received approximately $21.2 million for additional 2023 warrants, resulting in a net cost to us of approximately $8.9 million. In connection with the above described exchange, we also settled a pro rata share of the 2020 Notes Conversion Derivatives, 2020 Notes Hedges, and warrants corresponding to the amount of 2020 Notes exchanged pursuant to this exchange. We received proceeds of approximately $16.8 million related to the 2020 Notes Hedges and paid $11.0 million related to the 2020 Warrants, generating net proceeds of $5.8 million.\nSupplemental Non-GAAP Pro Forma Information. Due to the significance of the Cartiva business that is not included in our results of operations for the year ended December 30, 2018 and to supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including organic and combined pro forma net sales.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive or standard set of accounting rules or principles. Accordingly, the calculation of our non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the definitions of other companies using the same or similar names limiting, to some extent, the usefulness of such measures for comparison purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. See tables below for a reconciliation of our non-GAAP organic and combined pro forma net sales for the years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 to our net sales for such periods as calculated in accordance with US GAAP.\nThe Results of Operations\u201d discussion that appears below has been presented utilizing a combination of historical unaudited and, where relevant, non-GAAP organic and combined pro forma unaudited information to include the effects on our consolidated financial statements of our acquisition of Cartiva, as if the Cartiva acquisition had been completed as of December 26, 2016, the beginning of Wright's fiscal year 2017. The organic net sales reflect net sales by the legacy Wright business, which do not include net sales of products obtained through the Cartiva acquisition. The pro forma net sales have been adjusted to reflect the effect on our combined net sales of incremental revenues that would have been recognized had Cartiva been acquired on December 26, 2016. The Cartiva acquisition only affected the U.S. and international lower extremities product lines net sales. The non-GAAP organic and combined pro forma net sales have been developed based on available information and upon assumptions that our management believes are reasonable in order to reflect, on a pro forma basis, the impact of the Cartiva acquisition.\nThe non-GAAP organic and pro forma financial data is not necessarily indicative of results of operations that would have occurred had the Cartiva acquisition been consummated on December 26, 2016, the first day of the 2017 fiscal year, or which might be attained in the future.\nFinancial Highlights. Net sales increased 10.1% totaling $920.9 million in 2019, compared to $836.2 million in 2018, driven primarily by 13.3% growth in our U.S. net sales.\nOur U.S. net sales increased $82.8 million, or 13.3%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The ongoing launch of our AEQUALIS\u2122 FLEX REVIVE\u2122 revision shoulder system and continued success of the combination of our BLUEPRINT\u2122 enabling technology, AEQUALIS\u2122 PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System and SIMPLICITI\u00ae shoulder system contributed to non-GAAP, legacy Wright U.S. organic growth of 10.8%. The impact to our U.S. net sales from the Cartiva SCI was approximately $25.7 million. Our combined non-GAAP pro forma growth was 9.1% due to a reduction in Cartiva sales as the U.S. Cartiva business was transitioned to our direct U.S. lower extremities sales force during the third quarter of 2019.\nOur international net sales increased $2.0 million, or 0.9%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, driven by Cartiva net sales of $4.1 million and an increase in our direct markets in our international upper extremities business. This increase was offset by a $9.0 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates.\nIn 2019, our net loss from continuing operations totaled $92.1 million, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $169.3 million for 2018. This decrease in net loss from continuing operations was primarily driven by a decrease in other expense, net as 2018 included a $39.9 million charge for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount associated with the extinguishment of $400.0 million of the 2020 Notes and a $35.9 million loss for the net mark-to-market adjustments on our derivative assets and liabilities.\nOpportunities and Challenges. On November 4, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement with Stryker and its subsidiary, Stryker B.V. pursuant to which, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Stryker B.V. commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Wright for $30.75 per share, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes, in cash.\nWe intend to continue to focus on leveraging the global strengths of our product brands as a pure-play extremities and biologics business. Additionally, we believe the highly complementary nature of our businesses gives us significant diversity and scale across a range of geographies and product categories. We were delighted to add Cartiva's SCI, the first and only PMA product for the treatment of great toe osteoarthritis, to our market-leading lower extremities portfolio in October 2018. Supported by compelling clinical performance and backed by Level I clinical evidence, we believe Cartiva is well positioned for future growth as it addresses large markets with significant unmet needs and strong patient demand. As of August 1, 2019, the U.S. Cartiva business was transitioned to our direct U.S. lower extremities sales force.\nFurther, we believe our December 2017 acquisition of IMASCAP, a leader in the development of software-based solutions for preoperative planning of shoulder replacement surgery, ensures exclusive access to breakthrough software enabling technology and patents, including BLUEPRINT\u2122, to further differentiate our product portfolio and to further accelerate growth opportunities in our global extremities business. BLUEPRINT\u2122 is proving to be integral to our ability to convert competitive surgeons, and we believe that impact will increase as we execute our plans to make the system easier to use and release additional enhancements. As of December 29, 2019, approximately 40% of our U.S. shoulder customers are using BLUEPRINT\u2122.\nWe believe we have significant opportunity to increase sales with the recent and anticipated launch of new products, including our AEQUALIS\u2122 PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System, AEQUALIS\u2122 FLEX REVIVE\u2122 revision shoulder system, our PROstep\u2122 Minimally Invasive Surgery system, AUGMENT\u00ae Injectable, and through driving BLUEPRINT\u2122 adoption and by focusing on implementing initiatives to help us better compete at ambulatory surgery centers.\nSignificant Industry Factors. Our industry is affected by numerous competitive, regulatory, and other significant factors. The growth of our business relies on our ability to continue to develop new products and innovative technologies, obtain regulatory clearance and maintain compliance for our products, protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes, manufacture our products cost-effectively and on a timely basis to meet demand, respond to competitive pressures specific to each of our geographic markets, including our ability to enforce non-compete agreements, and successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner. We, and the entire industry, are subject to extensive governmental regulation. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We, as well as other participants in our industry, are subject to product liability claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nResults of Operations\nThe discussion below is on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise noted.\nComparison of the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 to the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands) and as percentages of net sales:\n\n___________________________\n 1 These line items include the following amounts of non-cash, share-based compensation expense for the periods indicated: \n\nThe following table sets forth our net sales by product line for our U.S. and International businesses for the periods indicated (in thousands) and the percentage of year-over-year change:\n\nThe following table reconciles our non-GAAP organic and combined pro forma net sales by product line for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 (in thousands):\n\n\nNet sales\nU.S. net sales. U.S. net sales totaled $706.3 million in 2019, a 13.3% increase from $623.5 million in 2018, primarily due to continued growth in our U.S. upper extremities business. Additionally, we had $25.7 million of net sales from Cartiva. We had non-GAAP organic growth of 10.8% along with non-GAAP combined pro forma growth of 9.1%.\nU.S. sales represented approximately 76.7% of total net sales in 2019, compared to 74.6% of total net sales in 2018.\nOur U.S. lower extremities net sales increased to $276.8 million in 2019 compared to $250.7 million in 2018, representing growth of 10.4%. This growth was primarily driven by Cartiva net sales of approximately $25.7 million. Our non-GAAP organic net sales of U.S. lower extremities increased 3.9%, which was in line with our expectations and primarily driven by 11% net sales growth in our total ankle replacement products, partially offset by flat performance in our core foot products. We believe our U.S. lower extremities business made good progress in bringing the U.S. lower extremities sales force back to full strength in the second half of 2019, filling our open territories with experienced foot and ankle reps, and we noted an improved growth rate in the fourth quarter for our total ankle products and our core foot and ankle products. We expect it will continue to take some time for the full benefits of these actions to be evident in our sales results.\nOur U.S. upper extremities net sales increased to $329.8 million in 2019 from $281.3 million in 2018, representing growth of 17.2%. This growth was driven by the ongoing launch of our AEQUALIS\u2122 FLEX REVIVE\u2122 revision shoulder system and continued success of the combination of our BLUEPRINT\u2122 enabling technology, AEQUALIS\u2122 PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System and SIMPLICITI\u00ae shoulder system.\nOur U.S. biologics net sales totaled $91.5 million in 2019, up from $83.1 million in 2018, representing a 10.1% increase over 2018. This increase was driven by net sales volume growth of AUGMENT\u00ae Injectable, which launched at the end of the second quarter of 2018 after receiving FDA approval, and in our core biologics products.\nInternational net sales. Net sales in our international regions totaled $214.6 million in 2019, compared to $212.7 million in 2018. This 0.9% increase was primarily driven by incremental Cartiva net sales and an increase in our direct markets in our international upper extremities business. These increases were offset by a $9.0 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 4 percentage point unfavorable impact to international sales growth rate).\nOur international lower extremities net sales increased 4.8% to $63.6 million in 2019 from $60.7 million in 2018. Sales increased primarily due to $4.1 million in Cartiva net sales. Non-GAAP organic international lower extremities sales decreased 1.5%, mostly due to a $2.4 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 4 percentage point unfavorable impact to international lower extremities sales growth rate). This unfavorable impact was partially offset by increased sales volumes to our distributor markets.\nOur international upper extremities net sales increased 3.4% to $118.4 million in 2019 from $114.5 million in 2018. Sales increased by a combined 8.5% in our direct markets. These increases were partially offset by a $5.5 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 5 percentage point unfavorable impact to international upper extremities sales growth rate).\nOur international biologics net sales decreased 14.5% to $22.0 million in 2019 from $25.8 million in 2018, due to timing of sales to stocking distributors and a $0.7 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 3 percentage point unfavorable impact to international biologics sales growth rate).\nCost of sales\nOur cost of sales totaled $188.6 million, or 20.5% of net sales, in 2019, compared to $180.2 million, or 21.5% of net sales, in 2018. Our 2019 cost of sales included a $5.2 million favorable adjustment as a result of our change in accounting estimate of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, as such inventory was sold (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of change in our estimate). Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales further decreased as a percentage of sales due to favorable manufacturing expenses and increased gross margins from Cartiva net sales, partially offset by inventory step-up amortization.\nOur cost of sales and corresponding gross profit percentages can be expected to fluctuate in future periods depending upon, among other factors, changes in our product sales mix and prices, distribution channels and geographies, manufacturing yields, period expenses, levels of production volume, and currency exchange rates.\nSelling, general and administrative\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $614.7 million, or 66.7% of net sales, in 2019, compared to $578.0 million, or 69.1% of net sales, in 2018. In 2019, selling, general and administrative expenses included transaction and transition costs of $5.8 million, or 0.6% of net sales, and a non-cash asset impairment associated with the technology transfer of $5.6 million, or 0.6% of net sales. In 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses included transaction and transition cost of $7.6 million, or 0.9% of net sales. The remaining selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 3 percentage points primarily due to leveraging certain general and administrative expenses over increased net sales.\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to decrease as a percentage of net sales in 2020 through opportunities to continue to improve efficiency and leverage our fixed expenses as we expect net sales to continue to increase at a higher rate than expenses.\nResearch and development\nOur investment in research and development expense totaled $74.1 million, or 8.0% of net sales, in 2019 compared to $59.1 million, or 7.1% of net sales, in 2018. Research and development costs increased 1 percentage point primarily due to investments in our new product pipeline.\nOur research and development expenses are estimated to range from 7% to 8% as a percentage of net sales in 2020.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nCharges associated with amortization of intangible assets totaled $31.9 million in 2019 compared to $26.7 million in 2018. Based on intangible assets held at December 29, 2019, we expect amortization expense to be between $27 million and $31 million per year for the years 2020 through 2024.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net, totaled $80.8 million in 2019 and $80.2 million in 2018. Increased interest expense in 2019 related primarily to non-cash interest expense associated with the amortization of the discount on the 2023 Notes, 2021 Notes, and 2020 Notes of $23.5 million, $22.0 million, and $3.8 million, respectively; amortization of deferred financing charges on our borrowings totaling $5.2 million; and cash interest expense totaling $29.0 million primarily associated with the 2023 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2020 Notes, and borrowings under our ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility, partially offset by interest income of $2.6 million.\nOur interest expense in 2018 related primarily to non-cash interest expense associated with the amortization of the discount on the 2023 Notes, 2021 Notes, and 2020 Notes of $10.1 million, $20.0 million, and $19.1 million, respectively; amortization of deferred financing charges totaling $5.4 million; and cash interest expense totaling $28.3 million primarily associated with the 2023 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2020 Notes, and borrowings under our ABL Facility and the 2021 Term Loan Facility. Our interest expense was partially offset by interest income of $2.7 million as result of the investment of the net proceeds from the 2023 Notes issued in the second quarter of 2018.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net totaled $9.9 million in 2019, compared to $81.8 million of other expense, net in 2018. In 2019, other expense, net, consisted primarily of a loss of $14.3 million on the exchange of the cash convertible notes, primarily due to settlement of related conversion derivative liabilities; and a $9.5 million loss related to fair value adjustments to contingent consideration; partially offset by a $11.0 million gain related to mark-to-market adjustments on derivative assets and liabilities; and a net gain on investments of $3.3 million. In 2018, other expense, net, consisted primarily of a $39.9 million charge for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount associated with the extinguishment of $400.0 million of the 2020 Notes; a $35.9 million loss for the net mark-to-market adjustments on our derivative assets and liabilities; a $3.2 million loss from foreign currency translation; and a $1.8 million loss on fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, including mark-to-market adjustments on CVRs issued in connection with the BioMimetic acquisition.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\nWe recorded a tax provision of $13.0 million in 2019 and a tax benefit of $0.5 million in 2018. During 2019, our effective tax rate was approximately (16.4)%, as compared to 0.3% in 2018. Our 2019 net tax provision includes an approximately $10.0 million tax provision due to a change in tax rates on income from deferred intercompany transactions and tax provision on net earnings in jurisdictions where we do not have a valuation allowance offset by a tax benefit for foreign currency losses. Our 2018 tax benefit included an approximately $3.6 million tax benefit recorded due to a change in our valuation allowance as a result of the Cartiva acquisition, a tax provision of $2.7 million due to a change in judgment regarding our ability to realize certain foreign deferred tax assets, and a $0.2 million U.S. tax benefit within continuing operations as a result of the pre-tax gain within discontinued operations. These amounts were offset by income tax provision for net income earned in jurisdictions where we do not have a valuation allowance.\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax, consists primarily of the costs associated with legal defense, income/loss associated with product liability insurance recoveries/denials, and changes to any contingent liabilities associated with the OrthoRecon business that was sold to MicroPort. Our loss from discontinued operations for the fiscal years ended 2019 and 2018 was net of $18.5 million in insurance recoveries recognized in 2019 and a $30.75 million insurance recovery recognized in 2018. See Note 4 and Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion regarding our discontinued operations and our retained contingent liabilities associated with the OrthoRecon business.\nReportable segments\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, net sales and operating income (loss) of our reportable segments expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands) and as a percentage of net sales:\n\n\nNet sales of our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment increased $34.4 million in 2019 over the prior year. Operating income of our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment increased $7.7 million in 2019 over the prior year. These increases to both net sales and operating income were driven primarily by net sales from Cartiva, as well as net sales growth from our INFINITY\u00ae total ankle replacement products, our core lower extremities and biologics businesses, and AUGMENT\u00ae Injectable, which received FDA approval in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in operating income was partially offset by investments in our lower extremities sales force. The Cartiva acquisition had an impact of approximately $16.6 million on net sales for our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment in 2019 over the prior year. The Cartiva acquisition had an impact of approximately $15.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 on operating income for our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment.\nNet sales of our U.S. upper extremities segment increased $48.4 million in 2019 over the prior year. Operating income of our U.S. upper extremities segment increased $25.9 million in 2019 over the prior year. These increases to both net sales and operating income were primarily driven by continued net sales growth within our innovative shoulder product portfolio, including the combination of our AEQUALIS\u2122 PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System, SIMPLICITI\u00ae shoulder system, and BLUEPRINT\u2122 enabling technology, the ongoing launch of our AEQUALIS\u2122 FLEX REVIVE\u2122 revision shoulder system, and leveraging certain selling, general and administrative expenses over increased net sales.\nNet sales of our International extremities and biologics segment increased $2.0 million in 2019 over the prior year. This increase to net sales was primarily due to incremental Cartiva net sales in our international lower extremities business and growth in direct market sales in our international upper extremities business. The Cartiva acquisition had an impact of approximately $3.8 million on net sales for our International extremities and biologics segment in 2019 over the prior year. This increase was mostly offset by unfavorable impacts from foreign currency exchange rates. International extremities and biologics segment had an operating loss of $1.9 million during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 compared to $1.5 million of operating income for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, resulting in a $3.4 million decrease in operating income (loss). This decrease was primarily due to spending associated with the new European Medical Device Regulation (MDR). These impacts were partially offset by the operating income from the Cartiva acquisition which totaled $3.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019.\nComparison of the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018 to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands) and as percentages of net sales:\n\n___________________________\n 1 These line items include the following amounts of non-cash, share-based compensation expense for the periods indicated: \n\nThe following table sets forth our net sales by product line for our U.S. and International businesses for the periods indicated (in thousands) and the percentage of year-over-year change:\n\nNet sales\nU.S. net sales. U.S. net sales totaled $623.5 million in 2018, a 12.4% increase from $554.5 million in 2017, primarily due to continued growth in our U.S. upper extremities business. Additionally, our U.S. lower extremities business had strong sales growth due to continued growth in both our core products and total ankle as well as $9.2 million of net sales from Cartiva. These increases were partially offset by four fewer selling days in 2018, the impact of which we estimate to be approximately $9.0 million. U.S. sales represented approximately 74.6% of total net sales in 2018, compared to 74.4% of total net sales in 2017.\nOur U.S. lower extremities net sales increased to $250.7 million in 2018 compared to $228.0 million in 2017, representing growth of 10.0%. This growth was driven by a 15% growth in our INFINITY\u00ae total ankle replacement products and net sales growth in our core lower extremities business primarily due to increased contributions from our expanded sales organization. Additionally, the impact from Cartiva revenue was approximately $9.2 million. These increases were partially offset by the impact of four fewer selling days in 2018.\nOur U.S. upper extremities net sales increased to $281.3 million in 2018 from $240.0 million in 2017, representing growth of 17.2%. This growth was driven by our innovative shoulder product portfolio, including the ongoing launch of our AEQUALIS\u00ae PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System, continued contributions from our SIMPLICITI\u00ae shoulder system, and accelerating adoption of our BLUEPRINT\u2122 enabling technology. These increases were partially offset by the impact of four fewer selling days in 2018.\nOur U.S. biologics net sales totaled $83.1 million in 2018, up from $78.4 million in 2017, representing a 6.0% increase over 2017. This increase was driven by net sales volume growth in our core biologics products and AUGMENT\u00ae Injectable, which launched at the end of the second quarter of 2018 after receiving FDA approval. These increases were partially offset by the impact of four fewer selling days in 2018.\nInternational net sales. Net sales in our international regions totaled $212.7 million in 2018, compared to $190.5 million in 2017. This 11.6% increase was primarily due to continued growth in our upper extremities business in both our direct and indirect markets. We also had a $4.8 million favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 3 percentage point favorable impact international sales growth rate).\nOur international lower extremities net sales increased 3.9% to $60.7 million in 2018 from $58.5 million in 2017 primarily due to increased sales volumes to our distributor markets and a $1.3 million favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 2 percentage point favorable impact to international lower extremities sales growth rate).\nOur international upper extremities net sales increased 20.9% to $114.5 million in 2018 from $94.7 million in 2017 due to a 12.9% increase in sales in our direct markets and significant increased sales volume to our distributor markets. The majority of our direct\nmarkets experienced significant growth during 2018. We also had a $3.1 million favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates (a 3 percentage point favorable impact to international upper extremities sales growth rate).\nOur international biologics net sales increased 15.6% to $25.8 million in 2018 from $22.3 million in 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to increased sales volumes to our distributor markets. The net impact from foreign currency exchange rates was immaterial.\nCost of sales\nOur cost of sales totaled $180.2 million, or 21.5% of net sales, in 2018, compared to $160.9 million, or 21.6% of net sales, in 2017. Our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales remained relatively constant as favorable manufacturing expenses were offset by unfavorable changes in customer and geographical mix.\nSelling, general and administrative\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $578.0 million, or 69.1% of net sales, in 2018, compared to $525.2 million, or 70.5% of net sales, in 2017. In 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses included transaction and transition costs of $7.6 million, or 0.9% of net sales. In 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses included transaction and transition cost of $9.0 million, or 1.2% of net sales, offset by a benefit from incentive and indirect tax projects of $9.0 million, or 1.2% of net sales. The remaining selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 2.3 percentage points due to leveraging corporate and certain U.S. selling, general and administrative expenses over increased net sales, partially offset by higher levels of cash incentive compensation expense and non-cash share-based compensation expense.\nResearch and development\nOur investment in research and development expense totaled $59.1 million in 2018 compared to $50.1 million in 2017. Research and development costs remained constant at approximately 7% of net sales.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nCharges associated with amortization of intangible assets totaled $26.7 million in 2018 compared to $28.4 million in 2017.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net, totaled $80.2 million in 2018 and $74.6 million in 2017. Increased interest expense was driven by the increase in debt outstanding following the issuance of the 2023 Notes in the second quarter of 2018 and the 2021 Term Loan Facility that was established during the second quarter of 2018 (see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of changes in our outstanding debt).\nOur interest expense in 2018 related primarily to non-cash interest expense associated with the amortization of the discount on the 2023 Notes, 2021 Notes, and 2020 Notes of $10.1 million, $20.0 million, and $19.1 million, respectively; amortization of deferred financing charges totaling $5.4 million; and cash interest expense totaling $28.3 million primarily associated with the 2023 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2020 Notes, and borrowings under our ABL Facility and the 2021 Term Loan Facility. Our interest expense was partially offset by interest income of $2.7 million as result of the investment of the net proceeds from the 2023 Notes issued in the second quarter of 2018. Our interest expense in 2017 related primarily to non-cash interest expense associated with the amortization of the discount on the 2021 Notes and 2020 Notes of $18.1 million and $27.3 million, respectively; amortization of deferred financing charges totaling $4.9 million; and cash interest expense primarily associated with the coupon on the 2021 Notes, 2020 Notes, 2017 Notes, and our ABL Facility totaling $23.5 million. An insignificant amount of interest income was recorded during 2017.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net was $81.8 million of expense in 2018, compared to $5.6 million of expense in 2017.\nIn 2018, other expense, net, primarily consisted of:\n \u2022 a $39.9 million charge for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount associated with the extinguishment of $400.0 million of the 2020 Notes; \n \u2022 a $35.9 million loss for the net mark-to-market adjustments on our derivative assets and liabilities; \n \u2022 a $3.2 million loss from foreign currency translation; and \n \u2022 a $1.8 million loss on fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, including mark-to-market adjustments on CVRs issued in connection with the BioMimetic acquisition.  In 2017, other income, net, primarily consisted of:\n \u2022 a $4.5 million loss on currency translation, including hedging activities; \n \u2022 a $5.3 million loss for the mark-to-market adjustment on CVRs; partially offset by \n \u2022 a $4.8 million gain for the net mark-to-market adjustments on our derivative assets and liabilities; and \n \u2022 a benefit of $0.6 million related to incentive and indirect tax projects.  Benefit for income taxes\nWe recorded a tax benefit of $0.5 million in 2018 and $35.0 million in 2017. During 2018, our effective tax rate was approximately 0.3%, as compared to 35.0% in 2017. Our 2018 net tax benefit included an approximately $3.6 million tax benefit recorded due to a change in our valuation allowance as a result of the Cartiva acquisition, a tax provision of $2.7 million due to a change in judgment regarding our ability to realize certain foreign deferred tax assets, and a $0.2 million U.S. tax benefit within continuing operations as a result of the pre-tax gain within discontinued operations. These amounts were offset by income tax provision for net income earned in jurisdictions where we do not have a valuation allowance. Our 2017 tax benefit included approximately $25.0 million recorded due to a change in our valuation allowance with respect to certain deferred tax assets that we had previously determined were not more-likely-than-not to be realized and a $8.3 million benefit resulting primarily from the effects of lower statutory tax rates and provisions regarding certain tax attributes resulting from tax reform legislation enacted in the United States and France. The remaining tax benefit in 2017 was primarily related to losses, including amortization of intangible assets, in jurisdictions where we do not have a valuation allowance.\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax\nFor the fiscal years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, totaled $0.2 million and $137.7 million, respectively. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, consists primarily of costs associated with legal defense, income/loss associated with product liability insurance recoveries/denials, and changes to any contingent liabilities associated with the OrthoRecon business that was sold to MicroPort.\nIn 2018, charges associated with product liability claims from the OrthoRecon business were fully offset by insurance recoveries. During the fiscal year ended 2017, the majority of our loss from discontinued operations was the result of our retained metal-on-metal product liability claims.\nSee Note 4 and Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion regarding our discontinued operations and our retained contingent liabilities associated with the OrthoRecon business.\nReportable segments\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, net sales and operating income of our reportable segments expressed as dollar amounts (in thousands) and as a percentage of net sales:\n\n\nNet sales of our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment increased $27.7 million in 2018 over the prior year. Operating income of our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment increased $16.3 million in 2018 over the prior year. These increases to both net sales and operating income were driven primarily by net sales growth from our total ankle replacement products, our core lower extremities and biologics businesses, AUGMENT\u00ae Injectable, which received FDA approval in the second quarter of 2018, and leveraging certain selling, general and administrative expenses over increased net sales. Additionally, the impact from the Cartiva acquisition had an impact of approximately $9.2 million and $4.3 million on sales and operating income, respectively, for our U.S. lower extremities and biologics segment.\nNet sales of our U.S. upper extremities segment increased $41.3 million in 2018 over the prior year. Operating income of our U.S. upper extremities segment increased $18.8 million in 2018 over the prior year. These increases to both net sales and operating income were primarily driven by net sales growth within our innovative shoulder product portfolio, including continued success of our AEQUALIS\u2122 PERFORM\u2122 Reversed Glenoid System and our SIMPLICITI\u00ae shoulder system, and leveraging certain selling, general and administrative expenses over increased net sales.\nNet sales of our International extremities and biologics segment increased $22.2 million in 2018 over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to increased sales in our direct markets in Europe and Canada, with continued growth in our international upper extremities business. Operating income of our International extremities and biologics segment decreased $2.1 million in 2018 over the prior year, primarily due to investments made in sales and marketing in our direct markets, as well as spending associated with the new European MDR.\nSeasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations\nWe traditionally experience lower sales volumes in the third quarter than throughout the rest of the year as many of our products are used in elective procedures, which generally decline during the summer months. This typically results in selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales that are higher during this period than throughout the rest of the year.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience meaningful variability in our net sales and cost of sales as a percentage of net sales among quarters, as well as within each quarter, as a result of a number of factors including, among other things, the number and mix of products sold in the quarter and the geographies in which they are sold; the demand for, and pricing of our products and the products of our competitors; the timing of or failure to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for products; costs, benefits, and timing of new product introductions; the level of competition; the timing and extent of promotional pricing or volume discounts; changes in average selling prices; the availability and cost of components and materials; number of selling days; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the timing of patients' use of their calendar year medical insurance deductibles; and impairment and other special charges.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain liquidity measures (in thousands):\n\n_____________________\n 1 As of December 29, 2019, the sale price condition (as defined within Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d) for the 2021 Notes was satisfied and, therefore, the 2021 Notes are convertible at any time during the succeeding quarterly period. As a result, the carrying value of the 2021 Notes was classified as a current liability as of December 29, 2019. The respective balances were classified as long-term as of December 30, 2018. \n 2 The holders of the 2020 Notes may convert their notes at any time on or after August 15, 2019. Due to the ability of the holders of the 2020 Notes to convert their notes within the next year, the carrying value of the 2020 Notes was classified as a current liability as of December 30, 2018. The 2020 Notes were classified as a current liability as of December 29, 2019 as they matured on February 15, 2020.  Operating activities. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities totaled $41.6 million, $(63.7) million, and $(184.8) million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily driven by improved cash profitability of continuing operations and lower levels of cash paid on contingent consideration and product liabilities associated with discontinued operations. During 2018, we paid $42.0 million upon reaching the CVR product sales milestone payment associated with sales for AUGMENT\u00ae Bone Graft and $88.6 million for discontinued operations as compared to $52.6 million for discontinued operations in 2019 (see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of product liability claims and insurance recoveries).\nThe decrease in cash used in operating activities in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to lower levels of cash settlements for product liability claims associated with discontinued operations. Cash used in discontinued operations totaled $88.6 million and $228.1 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively (see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of product liability settlement liabilities and insurance\nrecoveries), as well as improved cash profitability of continuing operations, partially offset by the 2018 payment of $42.0 million upon reaching the CVR product sales milestone payment associated with sales for AUGMENT\u00ae Bone Graft.\nInvesting activities. Our capital expenditures totaled $99.3 million in 2019, $71.5 million in 2018, and $63.5 million in 2017. This increase is primarily due to increased investments in surgical instrumentation to support the continued rollouts and upcoming product launches in our upper extremities business, as well as increased investments in computer systems. In 2019, we also incurred approximately $14 million for the purchase and set up of a 40,000 square foot state of the art manufacturing and distribution facility in Arlington, Tennessee.\nIn addition to capital expenditures, during 2018, the majority of our cash used in investing activities was associated with the acquisition of Cartiva for $434.3 million, net of cash acquired. Additionally, during 2017, we paid $44.1 million in conjunction with the IMASCAP acquisition, net of cash acquired. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding these acquisitions.\nFinancing activities. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $37.4 million, $598.1 million, and $46.8 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2019 was primarily attributable to $52.1 million in cash received from the issuance of ordinary shares in connection with option exercises. These proceeds were partially offset by $6.4 million of net payments related to the exchange of 2023 Notes for 2020 Notes (as further described below) and the associated issuance of additional 2023 Notes Hedges and warrants and settlement of pro rata portions of the 2020 Notes Hedges and warrants.\nOn February 7, 2019, WMG issued $139.6 million of additional 2023 Notes in exchange for $130.1 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Notes. As this was a debt modification, a pro rata share of the 2020 Notes deferred financing costs and discount was transferred to the 2023 Notes deferred financing costs and discount. Additionally, the 2023 Notes discount was adjusted in order for net debt to remain the same subsequent to the exchange. While the debt modification was a non-cash transaction, we paid approximately $3.0 million of debt modification costs.\nAdditionally, on January 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019, we, along with WMG, entered into cash-settled convertible note hedge transactions with certain option counterparties. WMG paid approximately $30.1 million in the aggregate to the option counterparties for the note hedge transactions, and received approximately $21.2 million in the aggregate from the option counterparties for the warrants, resulting in a net cost to us of approximately $8.9 million. In connection with the above described exchange, WMG also settled a pro rata share of the 2020 Notes Hedges and warrants corresponding to the amount of 2020 Notes exchanged pursuant to this transaction. We received proceeds of approximately $16.8 million related to the 2020 Notes Hedges and paid $11.0 million related to the 2020 Warrants, generating net proceeds of $5.8 million.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2018 was primarily attributable to the net cash proceeds received from the registered equity offering and 2023 Notes issuance. During August 2018, we entered into an underwriting agreement with J.P. Morgan, relating to a registered public offering of our ordinary shares. The discounted proceeds to Wright for the equity offering to fund the Cartiva acquisition were $448.9 million. Payments of equity offering costs were $25.9 million during 2018. Proceeds were subsequently used in October 2018 to fund the $435.0 million purchase price of Cartiva.\nDuring June 2018, we issued $675.0 million of 2023 Notes, settled $400.9 million of 2020 Notes, and paid a premium of $55.6 million on the 2020 Notes. We also paid $141.3 million for hedges associated with the 2023 Notes and received approximately $102.1 million for the issuance of warrants associated with the 2023 Notes. As part of the 2023 Notes issuance, Term Loan Facility and 2023 warrants, we paid $14.7 million for deferred financing costs. Other debt proceeds were primarily made up of the Term Loan Facility which were used to pay down a portion of the asset-based line of credit under the ABL Facility. In July 2018, we settled a pro rata share of the 2020 Notes hedges and 2020 warrants which resulted in net proceeds of $10.6 million.\nDuring 2018, we also received $21.6 million of cash from the issuance of ordinary shares in connection with option exercises under our share-based compensation plans.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2017 was primarily attributable to $34.9 million of debt proceeds largely from additional borrowings from the ABL Facility and $27.6 million of cash from the issuance of ordinary shares in connection with option exercises under our share-based compensation plans. This was partially offset by $11.5 million of debt payments including a $2.0 million payment of the 2017 Notes and net payments due to the weekly lockbox repayment/re-borrowing arrangement underlying the ABL Facility.\nRepatriation. As of December 29, 2019, approximately $0.5 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held by certain U.S.-controlled non-U.S. subsidiaries which may not represent available liquidity for general corporate purposes. Our current plans do not foresee a need to repatriate funds that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations or meet currently anticipated liquidity and capital investment needs.\nDiscontinued operations. Cash flows from discontinued operations are combined with cash flows from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash used in discontinued operations totaled $52.6 million, $88.6 million, and $228.1\nmillion for the years ended December 29, 2019, December 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively, and primarily related to payments of retained product liability claims from the OrthoRecon business. We do not expect that the future cash outflows from discontinued operations, including the payment of these retained liabilities of the OrthoRecon business, will have an impact on our ability to meet contractual cash obligations and fund our working capital requirements, operations, and anticipated capital expenditures.\nContractual cash obligations. At December 29, 2019, we had contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as follows (in thousands):\n\n_______________________________\n 1 Payments include amounts representing interest. \n 2 Our notes payable include 2020 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2023 Notes, ABL Facility, ABL Term Loan Facility, and other debt. See further discussion in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d \n 3 Represents interest on 2020 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2023 Notes, ABL Term Loan Facility, and other debt. See further discussion in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d \n 4 The 2021 Notes will mature on November 15, 2021 unless earlier converted or repurchased. As of December 29, 2019, the sale price condition (as defined in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d) for the 2021 Notes was satisfied and, therefore, the 2021 Notes are convertible at any time during the succeeding quarterly period. As a result, the carrying value of the 2021 Notes was classified as a current liability as of December 29, 2019 and the gross amount of $395.0 million is included in the less than 1 year total above. \n 5 All outstanding loans under the ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility will be due and payable in full on December 23, 2021 or earlier under certain specified circumstances as described in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The less than 1 year total above includes $20.7 million in borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility as this debt is reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 29, 2019 due to the weekly lockbox repayment/re-borrowing arrangement underlying the agreement, as well as the ability for the lenders to accelerate the repayment of the debt under certain circumstances.  The amounts reflected in the table above exclude the following:\n \u2022 product liabilities described in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d \n \u2022 2023, 2021, and 2020 Notes Conversion Derivatives (see", "item_7_tables": "Table 206: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>
