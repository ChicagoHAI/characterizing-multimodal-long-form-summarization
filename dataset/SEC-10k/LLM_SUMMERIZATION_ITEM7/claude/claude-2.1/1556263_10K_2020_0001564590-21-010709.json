MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the section titled Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company seeking to redefine the power of small molecules to control the expression of genes. Based on our unique ability to elucidate regulatory regions of the genome, we aim to develop medicines that provide a profound benefit for patients with diseases that have eluded other genomics-based approaches. We are currently focused on developing treatments for cancer and diseases resulting from mutations of a single gene, also known as monogenic diseases, and building a clinical stage pipeline of gene control medicines.\nOur lead product candidates are:\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> SY-1425, a selective retinoic acid receptor alpha, or RAR\u03b1, agonist that we are evaluating in a Phase 3 clinical trial in combination with azacitidine in a genomically defined subset of patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, or HR-MDS, and that we plan to evaluate in a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine in a genomically defined subset of newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, who are not suitable candidates for standard intensive chemotherapy;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> SY-2101, a novel oral form of arsenic trioxide, or ATO, which we plan to evaluate in a dose confirmation study, followed by a Phase 3 clinical trial, in patients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia, or APL; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> SY-5609, a highly selective and potent oral inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7, or CDK7, that we are currently evaluating in the dose escalation portion of a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with select advanced solid tumors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe also have multiple preclinical and discovery programs in oncology and monogenic diseases such as sickle cell disease and myotonic dystrophy type 1. We expect to nominate our next development candidate to enter investigational new drug application, or IND, enabling preclinical studies in 2022. In December 2019, we entered into a collaboration with Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc., or GBT, to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. We also use our gene control platform in collaboration with third parties to identify and validate targets in diseases beyond our current areas of focus. To this end, we entered into a target discovery, research collaboration and option agreement with Incyte Corporation, or Incyte, in January 2018, under which we are using our platform to identify novel therapeutic targets with a focus on myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nSY-1425\nAt the 62nd American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition held in December 2020, or ASH 2020, we presented new data from our fully enrolled Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine in newly diagnosed AML patients who are not suitable candidates for standard chemotherapy, as well as in relapsed or refractory, or R/R, AML patients who have been prospectively selected using our proprietary RARA, the gene that codes for RAR\u03b1 biomarker. As of an October 1, 2020 data cut-off, 51 newly diagnosed unfit AML patients, including both RARA-positive and RARA-negative patients, were eligible for a safety analysis. Among these patients, SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine was generally well-tolerated, with no evidence of increased toxicity relative to either as a single agent, including rates of myelosuppression that were comparable to single-agent azacitidine. As of the data cut-off, of the 18 RARA-positive patients that were evaluable for clinical response, the overall response rate, or ORR, was 67%, with a composite complete response rate of 61%, with 50% of patients achieving complete response, or CR, and 11% achieving a complete response with incomplete blood count recovery, or CRi. The median time to initial response was 1.2 months, the median duration of response was 10.8 months, and the median overall survival, or OS, among patients who achieved a CR or CRi was 18 months. As of the data cut-off, of the 28 RARA-negative patients that were evaluable for clinical response, the\nORR was 43%, with a composite complete response rate of 32%, with 25% of patients achieving CR and 7% achieving CRi. The median time to initial response was 3.0 months, and the median duration of response was 10.3 months. We also presented new translational data demonstrating that most RARA-positive newly diagnosed unfit AML patients have a monocytic disease phenotype that is highly correlated with resistance to upfront treatment with venetoclax and azacitidine. These data suggest that the RARA biomarker not only selects for patients who are more likely to respond to treatment with SY-1425 but also for patients who are less likely to respond to treatment with venetoclax and azacitidine. Approximately 18,000 patients are diagnosed with unfit AML in the United States and Europe annually and we expect the overall total addressable market opportunity for AML to grow to be in excess of $2 billion by 2029. At ASH 2020, we also announced that SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine was generally well-tolerated in the R/R AML patient population. Among the 21 R/R AML patients who were evaluable for clinical response as of the data cut-off, the ORR was 19%, and the median OS was 5.9 months. In hypomethylating agent, or HMA, and venetoclax na\u00efve patients, the ORR was 43%.\nBased on these data and our assessment of ongoing areas of high unmet need, we are advancing SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine into a registration-enabling Phase 3 clinical trial in RARA-positive newly diagnosed HR-MDS patients. HR-MDS is a hematologic malignancy that is closely related to AML, and as in AML, about 30% of HR-MDS patients are RARA-positive. Approximately 15,000 patients are diagnosed with HR-MDS in the United States and Europe annually and we expect the total addressable market opportunity for HR-MDS to grow to be in excess of $1 billion by 2029. We plan to enroll approximately 190 RARA-positive newly diagnosed HR-MDS patients in the double-blind placebo-controlled trial, randomized 2:1 to receive SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine or placebo with azacitidine, respectively. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the CR rate. We opened the Phase 3 clinical trial for enrollment in February 2021 and are actively screening patients. The trial, if successful, could enable us to submit to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, a new drug application, or NDA, as early as 2024. In addition, we plan to advance SY-1425 in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine in RARA-positive newly diagnosed unfit AML patients. The trial is designed with a single-arm safety lead-in to confirm the dosing regimen of the triplet to be used in the randomized portion of the Phase 2 clinical trial, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of SY-1425 in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine compared to venetoclax and azacitidine in approximately 80 patients randomized 1:1. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the composite CR rate. The trial will also evaluate the triplet as a salvage therapy in patients who do not respond to venetoclax and azacitidine. We expect to initiate the Phase 2 clinical trial in the second half of 2021, and we expect to report initial data from the trial in 2022.\nSY-2101\nIn December 2020, we acquired from Orsenix, LLC, or Orsenix, a novel oral form of ATO, which we refer to as SY-2101. SY-2101 is in development for the treatment of APL, a subtype of AML defined by a fusion of the RARA and promyelocytic leukemia, or PML, genes. Approximately 2,000 patients are diagnosed with APL in the United States and Europe annually, representing a potential total addressable market opportunity for APL of approximately $250 million based on current pricing estimates. An intravenously administered, or IV, formulation of ATO is approved for use in combination with All-Trans-Retinoic-Acid, or ATRA, in patients with newly diagnosed APL and, while curative in more than 80% of patients, its administration requires up to 140 two- to four-hour infusions over the typical course of induction and consolidation treatment. Because SY-2101 is dosed orally once daily, we believe it has the potential to become the standard-of-care frontline therapy for APL by providing comparable efficacy with a substantially more convenient option that reduces the treatment burden on patients, improving access, and lowering costs to the healthcare system. In a Phase 1 clinical trial, SY-2101 demonstrated bioavailability, pharmacokinetic, or PK, exposures similar to IV ATO, and a generally well-tolerated safety profile. We plan to initiate a dose confirmation study of SY-2101 in the second half of 2021 and anticipate reporting confirmatory dose and PK data in the first half of 2022. Following confirmation of a dose that demonstrates comparable PK to IV ATO, we intend to initiate a registration-enabling Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with newly diagnosed APL in 2022 which, if successful, could enable us to submit an NDA as early as 2024.\nSY-5609\nIn January 2020, we dosed the first patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial of SY-5609 in patients with select advanced solid tumors, including breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian and pancreatic cancers, and in solid tumors of any histology having retinoblastoma-pathway, or Rb pathway, alterations. The primary objectives of this trial are to assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of SY-5609, with the goal of establishing a maximum tolerated dose. Additional objectives include assessments of anti-tumor activity, PK, pharmacodynamics, or PD, and potential predictive biomarkers, including Rb pathway alterations. In June 2020, we began enrolling patients in a trial cohort assessing the safety of escalating doses of SY-5609 in combination with fulvestrant in HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients who have progressed after\ntreatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. In a future expansion portion of the Phase 1 clinical trial, multiple cohorts are planned to further evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of SY-5609 as both a single agent and in combination with other therapies.\nAt the 32nd EORTC-NCI-AACR Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics Symposium held in October 2020, or ENA 2020, we reported initial safety, PK, and PD data from the ongoing Phase 1 study of SY-5609. These data demonstrated proof of mechanism and support our ongoing development of SY-5609 for difficult-to-treat cancers. As of an August 21, 2020 data cut-off, 17 patients had been enrolled in the trial and were eligible for safety, PK and PD analysis. Patients were either treated with continuous daily dosing of single-agent SY-5609 at 1, 3, 4 or 5 mg, or for three weeks on and one week off at 3 mg in combination with fulvestrant. The data showed that SY-5609 demonstrated dose-dependent increases in POLR2A mRNA expression, a PD marker being used in the trial to measure CDK7 biological activity. Notably, increases in POLR2A in patients treated at 3 mg daily reached levels associated with tumor regressions in preclinical models, as well as with levels of CDK7 target engagement at which a clinical response and apoptosis were observed in a trial of patients treated with SY-1365, an IV CDK7 inhibitor that we had been developing in a Phase 1 clinical trial before we made the portfolio decision in October 2019 to discontinue its further development and prioritize the development of SY-5609. SY-5609 demonstrated approximately dose-proportional PK as both a single agent and in combination, minimal accumulation with repeat dosing, and a steady state half-life compatible with once-daily dosing. The majority of adverse events reported with SY-5609 as a single agent were low grade. The most common adverse events were nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, platelet count decrease, and vomiting. The safety profile of SY-5609 in combination with fulvestrant was consistent with that of single-agent SY-5609. Five of the 13 patients treated with single-agent SY-5609 were response evaluable, and of those, three achieved stable disease and two had progressive disease; one of the four patients treated in the combination cohort was response evaluable and had progressive disease. The maximum tolerated dose for continuous daily dosing was achieved at 3 mg. The Phase 1 clinical trial continues to actively enroll patients with select solid tumors, with additional cohort extensions in select populations. Alternate dosing regimens are also being explored in the trial. We expect to report additional dose escalation data, including clinical activity data, in the third quarter of 2021, and to initiate the expansion portion of the Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half of 2021.\nRecent Developments\nOn January 22, 2021, we issued and sold an aggregate of 5,400,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $14.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $75.6 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other transaction expenses of approximately $4.8 million. The public offering was made pursuant to an underwriting agreement between us and Cowen and Company, LLC and Piper Sandler & Co., as representatives of the several underwriters, on January 19, 2021. The public offering price was $14.00 per share, and the underwriters agreed to purchase shares from us pursuant to the underwriting agreement at a price of $13.16 per share. The shares were issued pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was filed with the SEC on June 12, 2020 and declared effective by the SEC on June 22, 2020.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized approximately $15.1 million of revenue, $11.7 million of which was related to our collaboration with GBT and $3.4 million of which was related to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $2.0 million and $2.1 million of revenue, respectively, all of which was attributable to our collaboration agreement with Incyte.\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including development of our gene control platform and the development of our product candidates, which include:\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> employee-related expenses, including salaries and benefits;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> stock-based compensation expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> external costs of funding activities performed by third parties that conduct research and development on our behalf and of purchasing supplies used in designing, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> consulting, licensing and professional fees related to research and development activities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> facilities costs, depreciation and amortization and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other operating costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments made to vendors for goods or services that will be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development, until related goods or services are provided.\nWe typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our research and development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, other internal costs or certain external consultant costs to specific product candidates or development programs.\nThe following table summarizes our external research and development expenses by program, as well as expenses not allocated to programs, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SY-1425 external costs (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SY-5609 and other CDK7 program external costs (1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SY-2101 program external costs (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other research and platform program external costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facilities and other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The results for the year ended December 31, 2019 include credits of $1.9 million and $1.2 million for our SY-1425 and SY-1365 clinical trials, respectively, due to a change in estimate of costs incurred over the life of these clinical trials through March 31, 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Our SY-1365 clinical trial costs are included within this caption as part of our CDK7 programs.

At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales of our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing such product candidates, including the uncertainty of:\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> successful completion of preclinical studies, including activities related to preparation of investigational new drug applications, or INDs, and minimally efficacious dose studies in animals, where applicable and required, under the requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or another regulatory authority;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> approval of INDs for our product candidates to commence planned or future clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> successful data from our clinical programs that support an acceptable benefit-risk profile of our product candidates in the intended populations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> successful development, and subsequent clearance or approval, of companion diagnostic tests for use in identifying potential patients;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply and commercial manufacturing and, where applicable, commercial manufacturing capabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> establishment and maintenance of patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> commercial launch of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> enforcement and defense of intellectual property rights and claims;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> retention of key research and development personnel; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAny changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates in preclinical and clinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our planned clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, information technology and administrative functions. Other significant costs include corporate facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees related to patent and corporate matters, and fees for accounting and consulting services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our product candidates.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments in marketable securities, including the related amortization of premium and discounts.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest, amortization of debt discount, and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our loans payable, and interest on finance lease arrangements.\nChange in Fair Value of Warrant Liability\nChange in fair value of warrant liability is the result of the remeasurement of the fair value of our warrant liability at each reporting period end.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in\ncircumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.\nRevenue\nTo date our only revenue has consisted of collaboration and license revenue. We have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized approximately $15.1 million of revenue, $11.7 million of which was related to our collaboration with GBT and $3.4 million of which was related to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized revenue of $2.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively, all of which was attributable to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte.\nWe recognize revenue in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606. ASC 606 applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps:\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (i)\n</td> <td> identify the contract(s) with a customer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (ii)\n</td> <td> identify the performance obligations in the contract;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (iii)\n</td> <td> determine the transaction price;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (iv)\n</td> <td> allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (v)\n</td> <td> recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations, and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into agreements that are within the scope of ASC 606. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following: non-refundable, up-front license fees, prepaid research and development services, development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products. Each of these payments would result in license and collaboration revenues, except for revenues from royalties on net sales of licensed products, which will be classified as royalty revenues.\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC 808, to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of ASC 606. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to ASC 606. For those elements of the arrangement that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 606, we apply the five-step model described above.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nExpenditures relating to research and development are expensed in the period incurred. Research and development expenses consist of both internal and external costs associated with the development of our gene control platform and product candidates. Research and development costs include salaries and benefits, materials and supplies, external research, preclinical and clinical development expenses, stock-based compensation expense and facilities costs. Facilities costs primarily include the allocation of rent, utilities, depreciation and amortization.\nIn certain circumstances, we are required to make nonrefundable advance payments to vendors for goods or services that will be received in the future for use in research and development activities. In such circumstances, the nonrefundable advance payments are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development, until related goods or services are provided.\nWe record accruals for estimated ongoing research costs. When evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities, we analyze progress of the work being performed, including the phase or completion of the event, invoices received and costs. Significant judgements and estimates may be made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ from our estimates.\nWe may in-license the rights to develop and commercialize product candidates. For each in-license transaction, we evaluate whether we have acquired processes or activities along with inputs that would be sufficient to constitute a business\u201d as defined under U.S. GAAP. A business\u201d as defined under U.S. GAAP consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to create outputs. Although businesses usually have outputs, outputs are not required for an integrated set of activities to qualify as a business. When we determine that we have not acquired sufficient processes or activities to constitute a business, any up-front payments, as well as milestone payments, are immediately expensed as acquired research and development in the period in which they are incurred.\nWarrants\nWe account for our issued warrants as either liability or equity in accordance with ASC 480-10, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, or ASC 480-10, or ASC 815-40, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company's Own Stock, or ASC 815-40. Under ASC 480-10, warrants are considered liability if they are mandatorily redeemable and they require settlement in cash or other assets, or a variable number of shares. If warrants do not meet liability classification under ASC 480-10, we consider the requirements of ASC 815-40 to determine whether the warrants should be classified as liability or equity. Under ASC 815-40, contracts that may require settlement for cash are liabilities, regardless of the probability of the occurrence of the triggering event. Liability classified warrants are measured at fair value on the issuance date and at the end of each reporting period. Any change in the fair value of the warrants after the issuance date is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as a gain or loss. If warrants do not require liability classification under ASC 815-40, in order to conclude warrants should be classified as equity, the Company assesses whether the warrants are indexed to its common stock and whether the warrants are classified as equity under ASC 815-40 or other applicable GAAP. Equity classified warrants are accounted for at fair value on the issuance date with no changes in fair value recognized after the issuance date.\nOn December 8, 2020, through a private placement, we issued 10,312,500 shares of our common stock and, in lieu of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of common stock, and, in each case, accompanying warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 2,828,125 additional shares of common stock (or pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock in lieu thereof) at a price of $8.00 per share and accompanying warrant (or $7.99 per pre-funded warrant and accompanying warrant). The private placement resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of $90.5 million, before $0.4 million of transaction costs.\nIn the event of certain fundamental transactions, the holders of warrants may require us to make a payment based on a Black-Scholes valuation, using specified inputs. The holders of the pre-funded warrants issued in the December 2020 private placement do not have similar rights. Therefore, we accounted for the warrants as a liability, while the pre-funded warrants met the permanent equity criteria classification. The pre-funded warrants are classified as a component of permanent equity because they are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the shares of common stock with which they were issued, are immediately exercisable, do not embody an obligation for us to repurchase those shares, and permit the holders to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise. In addition, the Pre-Funded Warrants do not provide any guarantee of value or return. The initial fair value of the warrants at issuance was $19.3 million, determined using Black-Scholes valuation model. We remeasured the warrant's fair value at December 31, 2020 as $19.7 million. The change in fair value of $0.4 was recorded in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for our stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of restricted stock units and stock option awards, to be recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of operations based on their grant date fair values. Effective January 1, 2019, grants of restricted stock units and stock option awards to other service providers, referred to as non-employees, are measured based on the grant-date fair value of the award and expensed in our consolidated statement of operations over the vesting period. Through December 31, 2018, grants of restricted stock unit and stock option awards to non-employees were required to be recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of operations based on their vesting date fair values. We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Prior to June 30, 2016, we were a private company and, therefore, lack company-specific historical and implied volatility information. As a result, we estimate our expected stock volatility based on a combination of our historical volatility and that of a publicly traded set of peer companies. We expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our own traded stock price. The expected term of our stock options has been determined utilizing the simplified\u201d method for awards that qualify as plain-vanilla\u201d options. Through December 31, 2018, the expected term of stock options granted to non-employees was equal to the contractual term of the option award. Effective January 1, 2019, the expected term of stock options to non-employees can be determined using either the contractual term of the option award or the simplified\u201d method. We elected to continue to use the contractual term in determining the expected term of stock option to non-employees. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We use the value of our common stock to determine the fair value of restricted stock awards.\nWe expense the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees and non-employees on a straight-line basis over the associated service period, which is generally the vesting period. We account for forfeitures as they occur instead of estimating forfeitures at the time of grant. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will be for only those options that vest.\nCompensation expense for discounted purchases under the employee stock purchase plan is measured using the Black-Scholes model to compute the fair value of the lookback provision plus the purchase discount and is recognized as compensation expense over the offering period.\nFor stock-based awards that contain performance-based milestones, we record stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the accelerated attribution model. Management evaluates when the achievement of a performance-based milestone is probable based on the expected satisfaction of the performance conditions as of the reporting date. For certain of our performance-based awards, notwithstanding any vesting in accordance with the achievement of performance-based milestones, such awards vest in full on the sixth anniversary of the vesting commencement date. Compensation expense for such awards is recognized over the six-year vesting period unless management determines that the achievement of any performance-based milestones is probable, in which case expense is accelerated.\nWe have computed the fair value of stock options at the date of grant using the following weighted-average assumptions:\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

The decrease in interest income during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to lower yield on our investments in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities due to capital market conditions in light of the COVID-19 pandemic during the majority of the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense was related to our credit facility with Oxford Finance, LLC, or Oxford, and equipment financing arrangements. The increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven by proceeds of $39.6 million, net of issuance costs, from our credit facility with Oxford, which was drawn in two tranches in February 2020 and December 2020.\nChange in fair value of warrant liability\nThe increase in in the change in fair value of warrant liability during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was a result of the remeasurement of the fair values of warrants issued in connection with the private placement financing in December 2020.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, together with the changes in those items in dollars (in thousands):\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollar Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Statements of Operations Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (68\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (77,741\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (64,296\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,445\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (72\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (71\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (75,438\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (62,279\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13,159\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized approximately $2.0 million and $2.1 million of revenue, respectively, all of which was attributable to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased by approximately $8.0 million, or 16%, from $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $58.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The change in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to an increase in employee-related costs, including salary, benefits and stock-based compensation, primarily due to our increased headcount period over period.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was derived from our investments in cash equivalents and marketable securities. The increase in interest income from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to higher average cash balances during 2019 as compared to 2018.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was related to our equipment financing arrangements. The increase in interest expense from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019, was due to a new equipment financing lease entered into during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nWe funded our operations from inception through December 31, 2020 primarily through the sale of equity securities, through license and collaboration agreements, including those with Incyte and GBT, and through the credit facility with Oxford.\nOn February 12, 2020, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, or the Loan Agreement, with Oxford. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, a term loan of up to an aggregate principal amount of $60.0 million is available to the Company. A $20.0 million term loan was funded on February 12, 2020, and another $20.0 million term loan was funded on December 23, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, $20.0 million remains available under the Loan Agreement, at the sole discretion of Oxford.\nOn June 12, 2020, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to register for sale from time to time up to $300.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units in one or more registered offerings. The registration statement was declared effective on June 22, 2020. Further, in June 2020, we entered into an at-the-market sales agreement, or the 2020 sales agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million through Cowen pursuant to the registration statement.\nUpon entry into the 2020 sales agreement, we terminated our prior at-the-market sales facility pursuant to the original sales agreement with Cowen, dated July 20, 2017, or the 2017 sales agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued $12.3 million in common stock under the 2017 sales agreement. We did not issue any shares of common stock pursuant to the 2020 sales agreement during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $75.0 million of our common stock remained available for future issuance under the 2020 sales agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $300.0 million of securities remained available for issuance under the shelf registration statement.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $174.0 million.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (57,364\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (60,253\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (40,315\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,734\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,643\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 142,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 132,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,997\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nThe use of cash in all periods presented resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $57.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $60.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a $20.0 million collection of the advanced payment pursuant to our collaboration agreement with GBT, offset by higher operating expenses associated with our ongoing preclinical and clinical development activities and the asset acquisition of SY-2101 during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $60.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $40.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a $13.1 million increase in our net loss from continuing operations and proceeds received upon entry into the Incyte target discovery collaboration during the year ended December 31, 2018 that did not reoccur in 2019.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $46.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $11.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to our reinvestment of $50.0 million of our funds from marketable securities upon their maturities into cash equivalents during the year ended December 31, 2020, and our purchase of $12.6 million of property and equipment for the buildout of our corporate headquarters during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $11.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $10.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to $12.6 million of purchases of property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the buildout of our corporate headquarters during the year ending December 31, 2019. This amount was offset by net maturities of marketable securities of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to net purchases of $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $143.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $66.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was the result of net proceeds of $39.6 million drawn from our credit facility with Oxford, $90.4 million from the issuance of securities in the December 2020 private placement, $11.9 million from the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to the 2017 sales agreement, $1.1 million from the issuance of shares of our common stock through our employee benefit plan and $0.4 million from issuance of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan, offset by payments of $0.2 million under our capital lease obligations and payments of $0.2 million of offering costs. Cash provided by financing activities for year ended December 31, 2019 of $66.0 million was primarily due to $65.0 million in net proceeds raised through two concurrent public offerings of equity securities that closed in April 2019.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $66.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $69.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to $65.0 million in net proceeds raised through two concurrent public offerings of equity securities that closed in April 2019, $0.8 million in net proceeds through the use of our at-the-market sales agreement, $0.2 million in proceeds through the sale of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan, and $0.2 million in proceeds through the exercise of stock options, offset by payments of $0.2 million under our capital lease obligations. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to net proceeds of $42.8 million from the sale of our common stock in an underwritten public offering in February 2018, $1.4 million in proceeds from our February 2018 private placement, $7.7 million in proceeds attributable to the equity investment made by Incyte in connection with entry into our target discovery collaboration, $16.6 million in net proceeds through the use of our at-the-market sales facility, and $0.6 million from the exercise of employee stock options, offset by net payments under our capital lease obligations.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue to advance our clinical trials of SY-1425, SY-2101 and SY-5609, seek to develop companion diagnostic tests for use with our product candidates, initiate new research and preclinical development projects and seek marketing approval for any product candidates that we successfully develop. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to establishing sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure to commercialize such products. We will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, eliminate, or out-license our research and development programs or future commercialization rights to our product candidates.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2020, together with the net proceeds from the underwritten public offering of our common stock that closed in January 2021, will enable us to fund our planned operating expense and capital expenditure requirements into 2023.\nOur future funding requirements, both short-term and long-term, will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of SY-1425, SY-2101 and SY-5609 and any associated companion diagnostic tests;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 248: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> research and preclinical development efforts for any future product candidates that we may develop;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the number of future product candidates that we pursue and their development requirements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to enter into, and the terms and timing of, any collaborations, licensing agreements or other arrangements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> whether a drug candidate will be nominated to enter investigational new drug application-enabling studies under our sickle cell disease collaboration with GBT, whether GBT will exercise its option to exclusively license intellectual property arising from the collaboration, whether and when any option exercise fees, milestone payments or royalties under the collaboration agreement with GBT will ever be paid, and whether we exercise our U.S. co-promotion option under the GBT agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 252: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> whether our target discovery collaboration with Incyte will yield any validated targets, whether Incyte will exercise any of its options to exclusively license intellectual property directed to such targets, and whether and when any of the target validation fees, option exercise fees, milestone payments or royalties under the collaboration agreement with Incyte will ever be paid;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 254: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of commercialization activities for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval to the extent such costs are not the responsibility of any future collaborators, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 255: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of acquiring potential new product candidates or technology;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 256: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of any physician education programs relating to selecting and treating genomically defined patient populations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 257: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the timing and amount of milestone and other payments due to licensors for patent and technology rights used in our gene control platform or to TMRC Co.

In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our common stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, rules.\nJOBS Act\nIn April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company, or EGC, can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an EGC can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.\nAs an EGC, we intend to rely on the exemption from the requirement to provide an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and with the exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding\nmandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an EGC until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the closing of our IPO; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under SEC rules.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Based on our unique ability to elucidate regulatory regions of the genome, we aim to develop medicines that provide a profound benefit for patients with diseases that have eluded other genomics-based approaches. We are currently focused on developing treatments for cancer and diseases resulting from mutations of a single gene, also known as monogenic diseases, and building a clinical stage pipeline of gene control medicines.\nOur lead product candidates are:\n \u2022 SY-1425, a selective retinoic acid receptor alpha, or RAR\u03b1, agonist that we are evaluating in a Phase 3 clinical trial in combination with azacitidine in a genomically defined subset of patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, or HR-MDS, and that we plan to evaluate in a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine in a genomically defined subset of newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, who are not suitable candidates for standard intensive chemotherapy; \n \u2022 SY-2101, a novel oral form of arsenic trioxide, or ATO, which we plan to evaluate in a dose confirmation study, followed by a Phase 3 clinical trial, in patients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia, or APL; and \n \u2022 SY-5609, a highly selective and potent oral inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7, or CDK7, that we are currently evaluating in the dose escalation portion of a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with select advanced solid tumors. \nWe also have multiple preclinical and discovery programs in oncology and monogenic diseases such as sickle cell disease and myotonic dystrophy type 1. We expect to nominate our next development candidate to enter investigational new drug application, or IND, enabling preclinical studies in 2022. In December 2019, we entered into a collaboration with Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc., or GBT, to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. We also use our gene control platform in collaboration with third parties to identify and validate targets in diseases beyond our current areas of focus. To this end, we entered into a target discovery, research collaboration and option agreement with Incyte Corporation, or Incyte, in January 2018, under which we are using our platform to identify novel therapeutic targets with a focus on myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nSY-1425\nAt the 62nd American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition held in December 2020, or ASH 2020, we presented new data from our fully enrolled Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine in newly diagnosed AML patients who are not suitable candidates for standard chemotherapy, as well as in relapsed or refractory, or R/R, AML patients who have been prospectively selected using our proprietary RARA, the gene that codes for RAR\u03b1 biomarker. As of an October 1, 2020 data cut-off, 51 newly diagnosed unfit AML patients, including both RARA-positive and RARA-negative patients, were eligible for a safety analysis. Among these patients, SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine was generally well-tolerated, with no evidence of increased toxicity relative to either as a single agent, including rates of myelosuppression that were comparable to single-agent azacitidine. As of the data cut-off, of the 18 RARA-positive patients that were evaluable for clinical response, the overall response rate, or ORR, was 67%, with a composite complete response rate of 61%, with 50% of patients achieving complete response, or CR, and 11% achieving a complete response with incomplete blood count recovery, or CRi. The median time to initial response was 1.2 months, the median duration of response was 10.8 months, and the median overall survival, or OS, among patients who achieved a CR or CRi was 18 months. As of the data cut-off, of the 28 RARA-negative patients that were evaluable for clinical response, the\nORR was 43%, with a composite complete response rate of 32%, with 25% of patients achieving CR and 7% achieving CRi. The median time to initial response was 3.0 months, and the median duration of response was 10.3 months. We also presented new translational data demonstrating that most RARA-positive newly diagnosed unfit AML patients have a monocytic disease phenotype that is highly correlated with resistance to upfront treatment with venetoclax and azacitidine. These data suggest that the RARA biomarker not only selects for patients who are more likely to respond to treatment with SY-1425 but also for patients who are less likely to respond to treatment with venetoclax and azacitidine. Approximately 18,000 patients are diagnosed with unfit AML in the United States and Europe annually and we expect the overall total addressable market opportunity for AML to grow to be in excess of $2 billion by 2029. At ASH 2020, we also announced that SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine was generally well-tolerated in the R/R AML patient population. Among the 21 R/R AML patients who were evaluable for clinical response as of the data cut-off, the ORR was 19%, and the median OS was 5.9 months. In hypomethylating agent, or HMA, and venetoclax na\u00efve patients, the ORR was 43%.\nBased on these data and our assessment of ongoing areas of high unmet need, we are advancing SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine into a registration-enabling Phase 3 clinical trial in RARA-positive newly diagnosed HR-MDS patients. HR-MDS is a hematologic malignancy that is closely related to AML, and as in AML, about 30% of HR-MDS patients are RARA-positive. Approximately 15,000 patients are diagnosed with HR-MDS in the United States and Europe annually and we expect the total addressable market opportunity for HR-MDS to grow to be in excess of $1 billion by 2029. We plan to enroll approximately 190 RARA-positive newly diagnosed HR-MDS patients in the double-blind placebo-controlled trial, randomized 2:1 to receive SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine or placebo with azacitidine, respectively. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the CR rate. We opened the Phase 3 clinical trial for enrollment in February 2021 and are actively screening patients. The trial, if successful, could enable us to submit to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, a new drug application, or NDA, as early as 2024. In addition, we plan to advance SY-1425 in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine in RARA-positive newly diagnosed unfit AML patients. The trial is designed with a single-arm safety lead-in to confirm the dosing regimen of the triplet to be used in the randomized portion of the Phase 2 clinical trial, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of SY-1425 in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine compared to venetoclax and azacitidine in approximately 80 patients randomized 1:1. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the composite CR rate. The trial will also evaluate the triplet as a salvage therapy in patients who do not respond to venetoclax and azacitidine. We expect to initiate the Phase 2 clinical trial in the second half of 2021, and we expect to report initial data from the trial in 2022.\nSY-2101\nIn December 2020, we acquired from Orsenix, LLC, or Orsenix, a novel oral form of ATO, which we refer to as SY-2101. SY-2101 is in development for the treatment of APL, a subtype of AML defined by a fusion of the RARA and promyelocytic leukemia, or PML, genes. Approximately 2,000 patients are diagnosed with APL in the United States and Europe annually, representing a potential total addressable market opportunity for APL of approximately $250 million based on current pricing estimates. An intravenously administered, or IV, formulation of ATO is approved for use in combination with All-Trans-Retinoic-Acid, or ATRA, in patients with newly diagnosed APL and, while curative in more than 80% of patients, its administration requires up to 140 two- to four-hour infusions over the typical course of induction and consolidation treatment. Because SY-2101 is dosed orally once daily, we believe it has the potential to become the standard-of-care frontline therapy for APL by providing comparable efficacy with a substantially more convenient option that reduces the treatment burden on patients, improving access, and lowering costs to the healthcare system. In a Phase 1 clinical trial, SY-2101 demonstrated bioavailability, pharmacokinetic, or PK, exposures similar to IV ATO, and a generally well-tolerated safety profile. We plan to initiate a dose confirmation study of SY-2101 in the second half of 2021 and anticipate reporting confirmatory dose and PK data in the first half of 2022. Following confirmation of a dose that demonstrates comparable PK to IV ATO, we intend to initiate a registration-enabling Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with newly diagnosed APL in 2022 which, if successful, could enable us to submit an NDA as early as 2024.\nSY-5609\nIn January 2020, we dosed the first patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial of SY-5609 in patients with select advanced solid tumors, including breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian and pancreatic cancers, and in solid tumors of any histology having retinoblastoma-pathway, or Rb pathway, alterations. The primary objectives of this trial are to assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of SY-5609, with the goal of establishing a maximum tolerated dose. Additional objectives include assessments of anti-tumor activity, PK, pharmacodynamics, or PD, and potential predictive biomarkers, including Rb pathway alterations. In June 2020, we began enrolling patients in a trial cohort assessing the safety of escalating doses of SY-5609 in combination with fulvestrant in HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients who have progressed after\ntreatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. In a future expansion portion of the Phase 1 clinical trial, multiple cohorts are planned to further evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of SY-5609 as both a single agent and in combination with other therapies.\nAt the 32nd EORTC-NCI-AACR Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics Symposium held in October 2020, or ENA 2020, we reported initial safety, PK, and PD data from the ongoing Phase 1 study of SY-5609. These data demonstrated proof of mechanism and support our ongoing development of SY-5609 for difficult-to-treat cancers. As of an August 21, 2020 data cut-off, 17 patients had been enrolled in the trial and were eligible for safety, PK and PD analysis. Patients were either treated with continuous daily dosing of single-agent SY-5609 at 1, 3, 4 or 5 mg, or for three weeks on and one week off at 3 mg in combination with fulvestrant. The data showed that SY-5609 demonstrated dose-dependent increases in POLR2A mRNA expression, a PD marker being used in the trial to measure CDK7 biological activity. Notably, increases in POLR2A in patients treated at 3 mg daily reached levels associated with tumor regressions in preclinical models, as well as with levels of CDK7 target engagement at which a clinical response and apoptosis were observed in a trial of patients treated with SY-1365, an IV CDK7 inhibitor that we had been developing in a Phase 1 clinical trial before we made the portfolio decision in October 2019 to discontinue its further development and prioritize the development of SY-5609. SY-5609 demonstrated approximately dose-proportional PK as both a single agent and in combination, minimal accumulation with repeat dosing, and a steady state half-life compatible with once-daily dosing. The majority of adverse events reported with SY-5609 as a single agent were low grade. The most common adverse events were nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, platelet count decrease, and vomiting. The safety profile of SY-5609 in combination with fulvestrant was consistent with that of single-agent SY-5609. Five of the 13 patients treated with single-agent SY-5609 were response evaluable, and of those, three achieved stable disease and two had progressive disease; one of the four patients treated in the combination cohort was response evaluable and had progressive disease. The maximum tolerated dose for continuous daily dosing was achieved at 3 mg. The Phase 1 clinical trial continues to actively enroll patients with select solid tumors, with additional cohort extensions in select populations. Alternate dosing regimens are also being explored in the trial. We expect to report additional dose escalation data, including clinical activity data, in the third quarter of 2021, and to initiate the expansion portion of the Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half of 2021.\nRecent Developments\nOn January 22, 2021, we issued and sold an aggregate of 5,400,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $14.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $75.6 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other transaction expenses of approximately $4.8 million. The public offering was made pursuant to an underwriting agreement between us and Cowen and Company, LLC and Piper Sandler & Co., as representatives of the several underwriters, on January 19, 2021. The public offering price was $14.00 per share, and the underwriters agreed to purchase shares from us pursuant to the underwriting agreement at a price of $13.16 per share. The shares were issued pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was filed with the SEC on June 12, 2020 and declared effective by the SEC on June 22, 2020.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized approximately $15.1 million of revenue, $11.7 million of which was related to our collaboration with GBT and $3.4 million of which was related to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $2.0 million and $2.1 million of revenue, respectively, all of which was attributable to our collaboration agreement with Incyte.\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including development of our gene control platform and the development of our product candidates, which include:\n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries and benefits; \n \u2022 stock-based compensation expense; \n \u2022 external costs of funding activities performed by third parties that conduct research and development on our behalf and of purchasing supplies used in designing, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials; \n \u2022 consulting, licensing and professional fees related to research and development activities; and \n \u2022 facilities costs, depreciation and amortization and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other operating costs. \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments made to vendors for goods or services that will be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development, until related goods or services are provided.\nWe typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our research and development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, other internal costs or certain external consultant costs to specific product candidates or development programs.\nThe following table summarizes our external research and development expenses by program, as well as expenses not allocated to programs, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SY-1425 external costs (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SY-5609 and other CDK7 program external costs (1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SY-2101 program external costs (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other research and platform program external costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facilities and other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The results for the year ended December 31, 2019 include credits of $1.9 million and $1.2 million for our SY-1425 and SY-1365 clinical trials, respectively, due to a change in estimate of costs incurred over the life of these clinical trials through March 31, 2019. \n (2) Our SY-1365 clinical trial costs are included within this caption as part of our CDK7 programs. In October 2019 we announced our decision to discontinue further development of SY-1365, which was completed during the year ended December 31, 2020. \n (3) In December 2020, we acquired SY-2101, a product candidate in development for the treatment of APL, from Orsenix. In connection with this acquisition, we made an up-front payment of $12.0 million to Orsenix, which we recorded as research and development expenses. \nWe expect our research and development expenses will increase for the foreseeable future as we seek to advance our programs. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales of our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing such product candidates, including the uncertainty of:\n \u2022 successful completion of preclinical studies, including activities related to preparation of investigational new drug applications, or INDs, and minimally efficacious dose studies in animals, where applicable and required, under the requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or another regulatory authority; \n \u2022 approval of INDs for our product candidates to commence planned or future clinical trials; \n \u2022 successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials; \n \u2022 successful data from our clinical programs that support an acceptable benefit-risk profile of our product candidates in the intended populations; \n \u2022 successful development, and subsequent clearance or approval, of companion diagnostic tests for use in identifying potential patients; \n \u2022 receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u2022 establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply and commercial manufacturing and, where applicable, commercial manufacturing capabilities; \n \u2022 establishment and maintenance of patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; \n \u2022 commercial launch of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; \n \u2022 enforcement and defense of intellectual property rights and claims; \n \u2022 maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval; \n \u2022 retention of key research and development personnel; and \n \u2022 the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nAny changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates in preclinical and clinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our planned clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, information technology and administrative functions. Other significant costs include corporate facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees related to patent and corporate matters, and fees for accounting and consulting services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our product candidates.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments in marketable securities, including the related amortization of premium and discounts.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest, amortization of debt discount, and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our loans payable, and interest on finance lease arrangements.\nChange in Fair Value of Warrant Liability\nChange in fair value of warrant liability is the result of the remeasurement of the fair value of our warrant liability at each reporting period end.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in\ncircumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.\nRevenue\nTo date our only revenue has consisted of collaboration and license revenue. We have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized approximately $15.1 million of revenue, $11.7 million of which was related to our collaboration with GBT and $3.4 million of which was related to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized revenue of $2.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively, all of which was attributable to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte.\nWe recognize revenue in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606. ASC 606 applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps:\n (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; \n (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; \nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (iii)\n</td> <td> determine the transaction price;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and \n (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. \nWe only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations, and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into agreements that are within the scope of ASC 606. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following: non-refundable, up-front license fees, prepaid research and development services, development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products. Each of these payments would result in license and collaboration revenues, except for revenues from royalties on net sales of licensed products, which will be classified as royalty revenues.\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC 808, to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of ASC 606. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to ASC 606. For those elements of the arrangement that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 606, we apply the five-step model described above.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nExpenditures relating to research and development are expensed in the period incurred. Research and development expenses consist of both internal and external costs associated with the development of our gene control platform and product candidates. Research and development costs include salaries and benefits, materials and supplies, external research, preclinical and clinical development expenses, stock-based compensation expense and facilities costs. Facilities costs primarily include the allocation of rent, utilities, depreciation and amortization.\nIn certain circumstances, we are required to make nonrefundable advance payments to vendors for goods or services that will be received in the future for use in research and development activities. In such circumstances, the nonrefundable advance payments are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development, until related goods or services are provided.\nWe record accruals for estimated ongoing research costs. When evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities, we analyze progress of the work being performed, including the phase or completion of the event, invoices received and costs. Significant judgements and estimates may be made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ from our estimates.\nWe may in-license the rights to develop and commercialize product candidates. For each in-license transaction, we evaluate whether we have acquired processes or activities along with inputs that would be sufficient to constitute a business\u201d as defined under U.S. GAAP. A business\u201d as defined under U.S. GAAP consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to create outputs. Although businesses usually have outputs, outputs are not required for an integrated set of activities to qualify as a business. When we determine that we have not acquired sufficient processes or activities to constitute a business, any up-front payments, as well as milestone payments, are immediately expensed as acquired research and development in the period in which they are incurred.\nWarrants\nWe account for our issued warrants as either liability or equity in accordance with ASC 480-10, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, or ASC 480-10, or ASC 815-40, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company's Own Stock, or ASC 815-40. Under ASC 480-10, warrants are considered liability if they are mandatorily redeemable and they require settlement in cash or other assets, or a variable number of shares. If warrants do not meet liability classification under ASC 480-10, we consider the requirements of ASC 815-40 to determine whether the warrants should be classified as liability or equity. Under ASC 815-40, contracts that may require settlement for cash are liabilities, regardless of the probability of the occurrence of the triggering event. Liability classified warrants are measured at fair value on the issuance date and at the end of each reporting period. Any change in the fair value of the warrants after the issuance date is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as a gain or loss. If warrants do not require liability classification under ASC 815-40, in order to conclude warrants should be classified as equity, the Company assesses whether the warrants are indexed to its common stock and whether the warrants are classified as equity under ASC 815-40 or other applicable GAAP. Equity classified warrants are accounted for at fair value on the issuance date with no changes in fair value recognized after the issuance date.\nOn December 8, 2020, through a private placement, we issued 10,312,500 shares of our common stock and, in lieu of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of common stock, and, in each case, accompanying warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 2,828,125 additional shares of common stock (or pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock in lieu thereof) at a price of $8.00 per share and accompanying warrant (or $7.99 per pre-funded warrant and accompanying warrant). The private placement resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of $90.5 million, before $0.4 million of transaction costs.\nIn the event of certain fundamental transactions, the holders of warrants may require us to make a payment based on a Black-Scholes valuation, using specified inputs. The holders of the pre-funded warrants issued in the December 2020 private placement do not have similar rights. Therefore, we accounted for the warrants as a liability, while the pre-funded warrants met the permanent equity criteria classification. The pre-funded warrants are classified as a component of permanent equity because they are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the shares of common stock with which they were issued, are immediately exercisable, do not embody an obligation for us to repurchase those shares, and permit the holders to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise. In addition, the Pre-Funded Warrants do not provide any guarantee of value or return. The initial fair value of the warrants at issuance was $19.3 million, determined using Black-Scholes valuation model. We remeasured the warrant's fair value at December 31, 2020 as $19.7 million. The change in fair value of $0.4 was recorded in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for our stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of restricted stock units and stock option awards, to be recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of operations based on their grant date fair values. Effective January 1, 2019, grants of restricted stock units and stock option awards to other service providers, referred to as non-employees, are measured based on the grant-date fair value of the award and expensed in our consolidated statement of operations over the vesting period. Through December 31, 2018, grants of restricted stock unit and stock option awards to non-employees were required to be recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of operations based on their vesting date fair values. We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Prior to June 30, 2016, we were a private company and, therefore, lack company-specific historical and implied volatility information. As a result, we estimate our expected stock volatility based on a combination of our historical volatility and that of a publicly traded set of peer companies. We expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our own traded stock price. The expected term of our stock options has been determined utilizing the simplified\u201d method for awards that qualify as plain-vanilla\u201d options. Through December 31, 2018, the expected term of stock options granted to non-employees was equal to the contractual term of the option award. Effective January 1, 2019, the expected term of stock options to non-employees can be determined using either the contractual term of the option award or the simplified\u201d method. We elected to continue to use the contractual term in determining the expected term of stock option to non-employees. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We use the value of our common stock to determine the fair value of restricted stock awards.\nWe expense the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees and non-employees on a straight-line basis over the associated service period, which is generally the vesting period. We account for forfeitures as they occur instead of estimating forfeitures at the time of grant. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will be for only those options that vest.\nCompensation expense for discounted purchases under the employee stock purchase plan is measured using the Black-Scholes model to compute the fair value of the lookback provision plus the purchase discount and is recognized as compensation expense over the offering period.\nFor stock-based awards that contain performance-based milestones, we record stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the accelerated attribution model. Management evaluates when the achievement of a performance-based milestone is probable based on the expected satisfaction of the performance conditions as of the reporting date. For certain of our performance-based awards, notwithstanding any vesting in accordance with the achievement of performance-based milestones, such awards vest in full on the sixth anniversary of the vesting commencement date. Compensation expense for such awards is recognized over the six-year vesting period unless management determines that the achievement of any performance-based milestones is probable, in which case expense is accelerated.\nWe have computed the fair value of stock options at the date of grant using the following weighted-average assumptions:\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

A slight decrease in consulting and outside services fees led to a decrease in general and administrative expense of approximately $0.2 million, or 1%, from $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest income\nInterest income was derived from our investments in cash equivalents and marketable securities. The decrease in interest income during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to lower yield on our investments in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities due to capital market conditions in light of the COVID-19 pandemic during the majority of the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense was related to our credit facility with Oxford Finance, LLC, or Oxford, and equipment financing arrangements. The increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven by proceeds of $39.6 million, net of issuance costs, from our credit facility with Oxford, which was drawn in two tranches in February 2020 and December 2020.\nChange in fair value of warrant liability\nThe increase in in the change in fair value of warrant liability during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was a result of the remeasurement of the fair values of warrants issued in connection with the private placement financing in December 2020.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, together with the changes in those items in dollars (in thousands):\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollar Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Statements of Operations Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (68\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (77,741\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (64,296\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,445\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (72\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (71\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (75,438\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (62,279\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13,159\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized approximately $2.0 million and $2.1 million of revenue, respectively, all of which was attributable to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased by approximately $8.0 million, or 16%, from $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $58.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The change in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to an increase in employee-related costs, including salary, benefits and stock-based compensation, primarily due to our increased headcount period over period.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was derived from our investments in cash equivalents and marketable securities. The increase in interest income from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to higher average cash balances during 2019 as compared to 2018.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was related to our equipment financing arrangements. The increase in interest expense from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019, was due to a new equipment financing lease entered into during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nWe funded our operations from inception through December 31, 2020 primarily through the sale of equity securities, through license and collaboration agreements, including those with Incyte and GBT, and through the credit facility with Oxford.\nOn February 12, 2020, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, or the Loan Agreement, with Oxford. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, a term loan of up to an aggregate principal amount of $60.0 million is available to the Company. A $20.0 million term loan was funded on February 12, 2020, and another $20.0 million term loan was funded on December 23, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, $20.0 million remains available under the Loan Agreement, at the sole discretion of Oxford.\nOn June 12, 2020, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to register for sale from time to time up to $300.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units in one or more registered offerings. The registration statement was declared effective on June 22, 2020. Further, in June 2020, we entered into an at-the-market sales agreement, or the 2020 sales agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million through Cowen pursuant to the registration statement.\nUpon entry into the 2020 sales agreement, we terminated our prior at-the-market sales facility pursuant to the original sales agreement with Cowen, dated July 20, 2017, or the 2017 sales agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued $12.3 million in common stock under the 2017 sales agreement. We did not issue any shares of common stock pursuant to the 2020 sales agreement during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $75.0 million of our common stock remained available for future issuance under the 2020 sales agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $300.0 million of securities remained available for issuance under the shelf registration statement.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $174.0 million.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (57,364\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (60,253\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (40,315\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,734\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,643\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 142,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 132,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,997\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nThe use of cash in all periods presented resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $57.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $60.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a $20.0 million collection of the advanced payment pursuant to our collaboration agreement with GBT, offset by higher operating expenses associated with our ongoing preclinical and clinical development activities and the asset acquisition of SY-2101 during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $60.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $40.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a $13.1 million increase in our net loss from continuing operations and proceeds received upon entry into the Incyte target discovery collaboration during the year ended December 31, 2018 that did not reoccur in 2019.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $46.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $11.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to our reinvestment of $50.0 million of our funds from marketable securities upon their maturities into cash equivalents during the year ended December 31, 2020, and our purchase of $12.6 million of property and equipment for the buildout of our corporate headquarters during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $11.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $10.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to $12.6 million of purchases of property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the buildout of our corporate headquarters during the year ending December 31, 2019. This amount was offset by net maturities of marketable securities of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to net purchases of $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $143.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $66.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was the result of net proceeds of $39.6 million drawn from our credit facility with Oxford, $90.4 million from the issuance of securities in the December 2020 private placement, $11.9 million from the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to the 2017 sales agreement, $1.1 million from the issuance of shares of our common stock through our employee benefit plan and $0.4 million from issuance of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan, offset by payments of $0.2 million under our capital lease obligations and payments of $0.2 million of offering costs. Cash provided by financing activities for year ended December 31, 2019 of $66.0 million was primarily due to $65.0 million in net proceeds raised through two concurrent public offerings of equity securities that closed in April 2019.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $66.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $69.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to $65.0 million in net proceeds raised through two concurrent public offerings of equity securities that closed in April 2019, $0.8 million in net proceeds through the use of our at-the-market sales agreement, $0.2 million in proceeds through the sale of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan, and $0.2 million in proceeds through the exercise of stock options, offset by payments of $0.2 million under our capital lease obligations. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to net proceeds of $42.8 million from the sale of our common stock in an underwritten public offering in February 2018, $1.4 million in proceeds from our February 2018 private placement, $7.7 million in proceeds attributable to the equity investment made by Incyte in connection with entry into our target discovery collaboration, $16.6 million in net proceeds through the use of our at-the-market sales facility, and $0.6 million from the exercise of employee stock options, offset by net payments under our capital lease obligations.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue to advance our clinical trials of SY-1425, SY-2101 and SY-5609, seek to develop companion diagnostic tests for use with our product candidates, initiate new research and preclinical development projects and seek marketing approval for any product candidates that we successfully develop. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to establishing sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure to commercialize such products. We will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, eliminate, or out-license our research and development programs or future commercialization rights to our product candidates.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2020, together with the net proceeds from the underwritten public offering of our common stock that closed in January 2021, will enable us to fund our planned operating expense and capital expenditure requirements into 2023.\nOur future funding requirements, both short-term and long-term, will depend on many factors, including:\n \u2022 the scope, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of SY-1425, SY-2101 and SY-5609 and any associated companion diagnostic tests; \n \u2022 research and preclinical development efforts for any future product candidates that we may develop; \n \u2022 the number of future product candidates that we pursue and their development requirements; \n \u2022 our ability to enter into, and the terms and timing of, any collaborations, licensing agreements or other arrangements; \n \u2022 whether a drug candidate will be nominated to enter investigational new drug application-enabling studies under our sickle cell disease collaboration with GBT, whether GBT will exercise its option to exclusively license intellectual property arising from the collaboration, whether and when any option exercise fees, milestone payments or royalties under the collaboration agreement with GBT will ever be paid, and whether we exercise our U.S. co-promotion option under the GBT agreement; \n \u2022 whether our target discovery collaboration with Incyte will yield any validated targets, whether Incyte will exercise any of its options to exclusively license intellectual property directed to such targets, and whether and when any of the target validation fees, option exercise fees, milestone payments or royalties under the collaboration agreement with Incyte will ever be paid; \n \u2022 the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals; \n \u2022 the costs of commercialization activities for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval to the extent such costs are not the responsibility of any future collaborators, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities; \n \u2022 the costs of acquiring potential new product candidates or technology; \n \u2022 the costs of any physician education programs relating to selecting and treating genomically defined patient populations; \n \u2022 the timing and amount of milestone and other payments due to licensors for patent and technology rights used in our gene control platform or to TMRC Co. Ltd., or TMRC, associated with the development, manufacture and commercialization of SY-1425; \n \u2022 the timing and amount of milestone payments due to Orsenix associated with the development and commercialization of SY-2101; \n \u2022 revenue received from commercial sales, if any, of our current and future product candidates; \n \u2022 our headcount growth and associated costs as we advance our research and development programs and establish a commercial infrastructure; \n \u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property related claims; and \n \u2022 the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes many years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our common stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, rules.\nJOBS Act\nIn April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company, or EGC, can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an EGC can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.\nAs an EGC, we intend to rely on the exemption from the requirement to provide an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and with the exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding\nmandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an EGC until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the closing of our IPO; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under SEC rules.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the section titled Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company seeking to redefine the power of small molecules to control the expression of genes. Based on our unique ability to elucidate regulatory regions of the genome, we aim to develop medicines that provide a profound benefit for patients with diseases that have eluded other genomics-based approaches. We are currently focused on developing treatments for cancer and diseases resulting from mutations of a single gene, also known as monogenic diseases, and building a clinical stage pipeline of gene control medicines.\nOur lead product candidates are:\n \u2022 SY-1425, a selective retinoic acid receptor alpha, or RAR\u03b1, agonist that we are evaluating in a Phase 3 clinical trial in combination with azacitidine in a genomically defined subset of patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, or HR-MDS, and that we plan to evaluate in a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine in a genomically defined subset of newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, who are not suitable candidates for standard intensive chemotherapy; \n \u2022 SY-2101, a novel oral form of arsenic trioxide, or ATO, which we plan to evaluate in a dose confirmation study, followed by a Phase 3 clinical trial, in patients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia, or APL; and \n \u2022 SY-5609, a highly selective and potent oral inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7, or CDK7, that we are currently evaluating in the dose escalation portion of a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with select advanced solid tumors. \nWe also have multiple preclinical and discovery programs in oncology and monogenic diseases such as sickle cell disease and myotonic dystrophy type 1. We expect to nominate our next development candidate to enter investigational new drug application, or IND, enabling preclinical studies in 2022. In December 2019, we entered into a collaboration with Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc., or GBT, to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. We also use our gene control platform in collaboration with third parties to identify and validate targets in diseases beyond our current areas of focus. To this end, we entered into a target discovery, research collaboration and option agreement with Incyte Corporation, or Incyte, in January 2018, under which we are using our platform to identify novel therapeutic targets with a focus on myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nSY-1425\nAt the 62nd American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition held in December 2020, or ASH 2020, we presented new data from our fully enrolled Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine in newly diagnosed AML patients who are not suitable candidates for standard chemotherapy, as well as in relapsed or refractory, or R/R, AML patients who have been prospectively selected using our proprietary RARA, the gene that codes for RAR\u03b1 biomarker. As of an October 1, 2020 data cut-off, 51 newly diagnosed unfit AML patients, including both RARA-positive and RARA-negative patients, were eligible for a safety analysis. Among these patients, SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine was generally well-tolerated, with no evidence of increased toxicity relative to either as a single agent, including rates of myelosuppression that were comparable to single-agent azacitidine. As of the data cut-off, of the 18 RARA-positive patients that were evaluable for clinical response, the overall response rate, or ORR, was 67%, with a composite complete response rate of 61%, with 50% of patients achieving complete response, or CR, and 11% achieving a complete response with incomplete blood count recovery, or CRi. The median time to initial response was 1.2 months, the median duration of response was 10.8 months, and the median overall survival, or OS, among patients who achieved a CR or CRi was 18 months. As of the data cut-off, of the 28 RARA-negative patients that were evaluable for clinical response, the\nORR was 43%, with a composite complete response rate of 32%, with 25% of patients achieving CR and 7% achieving CRi. The median time to initial response was 3.0 months, and the median duration of response was 10.3 months. We also presented new translational data demonstrating that most RARA-positive newly diagnosed unfit AML patients have a monocytic disease phenotype that is highly correlated with resistance to upfront treatment with venetoclax and azacitidine. These data suggest that the RARA biomarker not only selects for patients who are more likely to respond to treatment with SY-1425 but also for patients who are less likely to respond to treatment with venetoclax and azacitidine. Approximately 18,000 patients are diagnosed with unfit AML in the United States and Europe annually and we expect the overall total addressable market opportunity for AML to grow to be in excess of $2 billion by 2029. At ASH 2020, we also announced that SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine was generally well-tolerated in the R/R AML patient population. Among the 21 R/R AML patients who were evaluable for clinical response as of the data cut-off, the ORR was 19%, and the median OS was 5.9 months. In hypomethylating agent, or HMA, and venetoclax na\u00efve patients, the ORR was 43%.\nBased on these data and our assessment of ongoing areas of high unmet need, we are advancing SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine into a registration-enabling Phase 3 clinical trial in RARA-positive newly diagnosed HR-MDS patients. HR-MDS is a hematologic malignancy that is closely related to AML, and as in AML, about 30% of HR-MDS patients are RARA-positive. Approximately 15,000 patients are diagnosed with HR-MDS in the United States and Europe annually and we expect the total addressable market opportunity for HR-MDS to grow to be in excess of $1 billion by 2029. We plan to enroll approximately 190 RARA-positive newly diagnosed HR-MDS patients in the double-blind placebo-controlled trial, randomized 2:1 to receive SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine or placebo with azacitidine, respectively. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the CR rate. We opened the Phase 3 clinical trial for enrollment in February 2021 and are actively screening patients. The trial, if successful, could enable us to submit to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, a new drug application, or NDA, as early as 2024. In addition, we plan to advance SY-1425 in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine in RARA-positive newly diagnosed unfit AML patients. The trial is designed with a single-arm safety lead-in to confirm the dosing regimen of the triplet to be used in the randomized portion of the Phase 2 clinical trial, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of SY-1425 in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine compared to venetoclax and azacitidine in approximately 80 patients randomized 1:1. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the composite CR rate. The trial will also evaluate the triplet as a salvage therapy in patients who do not respond to venetoclax and azacitidine. We expect to initiate the Phase 2 clinical trial in the second half of 2021, and we expect to report initial data from the trial in 2022.\nSY-2101\nIn December 2020, we acquired from Orsenix, LLC, or Orsenix, a novel oral form of ATO, which we refer to as SY-2101. SY-2101 is in development for the treatment of APL, a subtype of AML defined by a fusion of the RARA and promyelocytic leukemia, or PML, genes. Approximately 2,000 patients are diagnosed with APL in the United States and Europe annually, representing a potential total addressable market opportunity for APL of approximately $250 million based on current pricing estimates. An intravenously administered, or IV, formulation of ATO is approved for use in combination with All-Trans-Retinoic-Acid, or ATRA, in patients with newly diagnosed APL and, while curative in more than 80% of patients, its administration requires up to 140 two- to four-hour infusions over the typical course of induction and consolidation treatment. Because SY-2101 is dosed orally once daily, we believe it has the potential to become the standard-of-care frontline therapy for APL by providing comparable efficacy with a substantially more convenient option that reduces the treatment burden on patients, improving access, and lowering costs to the healthcare system. In a Phase 1 clinical trial, SY-2101 demonstrated bioavailability, pharmacokinetic, or PK, exposures similar to IV ATO, and a generally well-tolerated safety profile. We plan to initiate a dose confirmation study of SY-2101 in the second half of 2021 and anticipate reporting confirmatory dose and PK data in the first half of 2022. Following confirmation of a dose that demonstrates comparable PK to IV ATO, we intend to initiate a registration-enabling Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with newly diagnosed APL in 2022 which, if successful, could enable us to submit an NDA as early as 2024.\nSY-5609\nIn January 2020, we dosed the first patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial of SY-5609 in patients with select advanced solid tumors, including breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian and pancreatic cancers, and in solid tumors of any histology having retinoblastoma-pathway, or Rb pathway, alterations. The primary objectives of this trial are to assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of SY-5609, with the goal of establishing a maximum tolerated dose. Additional objectives include assessments of anti-tumor activity, PK, pharmacodynamics, or PD, and potential predictive biomarkers, including Rb pathway alterations. In June 2020, we began enrolling patients in a trial cohort assessing the safety of escalating doses of SY-5609 in combination with fulvestrant in HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients who have progressed after\ntreatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. In a future expansion portion of the Phase 1 clinical trial, multiple cohorts are planned to further evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of SY-5609 as both a single agent and in combination with other therapies.\nAt the 32nd EORTC-NCI-AACR Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics Symposium held in October 2020, or ENA 2020, we reported initial safety, PK, and PD data from the ongoing Phase 1 study of SY-5609. These data demonstrated proof of mechanism and support our ongoing development of SY-5609 for difficult-to-treat cancers. As of an August 21, 2020 data cut-off, 17 patients had been enrolled in the trial and were eligible for safety, PK and PD analysis. Patients were either treated with continuous daily dosing of single-agent SY-5609 at 1, 3, 4 or 5 mg, or for three weeks on and one week off at 3 mg in combination with fulvestrant. The data showed that SY-5609 demonstrated dose-dependent increases in POLR2A mRNA expression, a PD marker being used in the trial to measure CDK7 biological activity. Notably, increases in POLR2A in patients treated at 3 mg daily reached levels associated with tumor regressions in preclinical models, as well as with levels of CDK7 target engagement at which a clinical response and apoptosis were observed in a trial of patients treated with SY-1365, an IV CDK7 inhibitor that we had been developing in a Phase 1 clinical trial before we made the portfolio decision in October 2019 to discontinue its further development and prioritize the development of SY-5609. SY-5609 demonstrated approximately dose-proportional PK as both a single agent and in combination, minimal accumulation with repeat dosing, and a steady state half-life compatible with once-daily dosing. The majority of adverse events reported with SY-5609 as a single agent were low grade. The most common adverse events were nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, platelet count decrease, and vomiting. The safety profile of SY-5609 in combination with fulvestrant was consistent with that of single-agent SY-5609. Five of the 13 patients treated with single-agent SY-5609 were response evaluable, and of those, three achieved stable disease and two had progressive disease; one of the four patients treated in the combination cohort was response evaluable and had progressive disease. The maximum tolerated dose for continuous daily dosing was achieved at 3 mg. The Phase 1 clinical trial continues to actively enroll patients with select solid tumors, with additional cohort extensions in select populations. Alternate dosing regimens are also being explored in the trial. We expect to report additional dose escalation data, including clinical activity data, in the third quarter of 2021, and to initiate the expansion portion of the Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half of 2021.\nRecent Developments\nOn January 22, 2021, we issued and sold an aggregate of 5,400,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $14.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $75.6 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other transaction expenses of approximately $4.8 million. The public offering was made pursuant to an underwriting agreement between us and Cowen and Company, LLC and Piper Sandler & Co., as representatives of the several underwriters, on January 19, 2021. The public offering price was $14.00 per share, and the underwriters agreed to purchase shares from us pursuant to the underwriting agreement at a price of $13.16 per share. The shares were issued pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was filed with the SEC on June 12, 2020 and declared effective by the SEC on June 22, 2020.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized approximately $15.1 million of revenue, $11.7 million of which was related to our collaboration with GBT and $3.4 million of which was related to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $2.0 million and $2.1 million of revenue, respectively, all of which was attributable to our collaboration agreement with Incyte.\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including development of our gene control platform and the development of our product candidates, which include:\n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries and benefits; \n \u2022 stock-based compensation expense; \n \u2022 external costs of funding activities performed by third parties that conduct research and development on our behalf and of purchasing supplies used in designing, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials; \n \u2022 consulting, licensing and professional fees related to research and development activities; and \n \u2022 facilities costs, depreciation and amortization and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other operating costs. \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments made to vendors for goods or services that will be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development, until related goods or services are provided.\nWe typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our research and development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, other internal costs or certain external consultant costs to specific product candidates or development programs.\nThe following table summarizes our external research and development expenses by program, as well as expenses not allocated to programs, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\n\n (1) The results for the year ended December 31, 2019 include credits of $1.9 million and $1.2 million for our SY-1425 and SY-1365 clinical trials, respectively, due to a change in estimate of costs incurred over the life of these clinical trials through March 31, 2019. \n (2) Our SY-1365 clinical trial costs are included within this caption as part of our CDK7 programs. In October 2019 we announced our decision to discontinue further development of SY-1365, which was completed during the year ended December 31, 2020. \n (3) In December 2020, we acquired SY-2101, a product candidate in development for the treatment of APL, from Orsenix. In connection with this acquisition, we made an up-front payment of $12.0 million to Orsenix, which we recorded as research and development expenses. \nWe expect our research and development expenses will increase for the foreseeable future as we seek to advance our programs. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales of our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing such product candidates, including the uncertainty of:\n \u2022 successful completion of preclinical studies, including activities related to preparation of investigational new drug applications, or INDs, and minimally efficacious dose studies in animals, where applicable and required, under the requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or another regulatory authority; \n \u2022 approval of INDs for our product candidates to commence planned or future clinical trials; \n \u2022 successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials; \n \u2022 successful data from our clinical programs that support an acceptable benefit-risk profile of our product candidates in the intended populations; \n \u2022 successful development, and subsequent clearance or approval, of companion diagnostic tests for use in identifying potential patients; \n \u2022 receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u2022 establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply and commercial manufacturing and, where applicable, commercial manufacturing capabilities; \n \u2022 establishment and maintenance of patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; \n \u2022 commercial launch of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; \n \u2022 enforcement and defense of intellectual property rights and claims; \n \u2022 maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval; \n \u2022 retention of key research and development personnel; and \n \u2022 the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nAny changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates in preclinical and clinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our planned clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, information technology and administrative functions. Other significant costs include corporate facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees related to patent and corporate matters, and fees for accounting and consulting services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our product candidates.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments in marketable securities, including the related amortization of premium and discounts.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest, amortization of debt discount, and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our loans payable, and interest on finance lease arrangements.\nChange in Fair Value of Warrant Liability\nChange in fair value of warrant liability is the result of the remeasurement of the fair value of our warrant liability at each reporting period end.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in\ncircumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.\nRevenue\nTo date our only revenue has consisted of collaboration and license revenue. We have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized approximately $15.1 million of revenue, $11.7 million of which was related to our collaboration with GBT and $3.4 million of which was related to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized revenue of $2.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively, all of which was attributable to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte.\nWe recognize revenue in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606. ASC 606 applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps:\n (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; \n (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; \n\n (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and \n (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. \nWe only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations, and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into agreements that are within the scope of ASC 606. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following: non-refundable, up-front license fees, prepaid research and development services, development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products. Each of these payments would result in license and collaboration revenues, except for revenues from royalties on net sales of licensed products, which will be classified as royalty revenues.\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC 808, to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of ASC 606. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to ASC 606. For those elements of the arrangement that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 606, we apply the five-step model described above.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nExpenditures relating to research and development are expensed in the period incurred. Research and development expenses consist of both internal and external costs associated with the development of our gene control platform and product candidates. Research and development costs include salaries and benefits, materials and supplies, external research, preclinical and clinical development expenses, stock-based compensation expense and facilities costs. Facilities costs primarily include the allocation of rent, utilities, depreciation and amortization.\nIn certain circumstances, we are required to make nonrefundable advance payments to vendors for goods or services that will be received in the future for use in research and development activities. In such circumstances, the nonrefundable advance payments are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development, until related goods or services are provided.\nWe record accruals for estimated ongoing research costs. When evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities, we analyze progress of the work being performed, including the phase or completion of the event, invoices received and costs. Significant judgements and estimates may be made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ from our estimates.\nWe may in-license the rights to develop and commercialize product candidates. For each in-license transaction, we evaluate whether we have acquired processes or activities along with inputs that would be sufficient to constitute a business\u201d as defined under U.S. GAAP. A business\u201d as defined under U.S. GAAP consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to create outputs. Although businesses usually have outputs, outputs are not required for an integrated set of activities to qualify as a business. When we determine that we have not acquired sufficient processes or activities to constitute a business, any up-front payments, as well as milestone payments, are immediately expensed as acquired research and development in the period in which they are incurred.\nWarrants\nWe account for our issued warrants as either liability or equity in accordance with ASC 480-10, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, or ASC 480-10, or ASC 815-40, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company's Own Stock, or ASC 815-40. Under ASC 480-10, warrants are considered liability if they are mandatorily redeemable and they require settlement in cash or other assets, or a variable number of shares. If warrants do not meet liability classification under ASC 480-10, we consider the requirements of ASC 815-40 to determine whether the warrants should be classified as liability or equity. Under ASC 815-40, contracts that may require settlement for cash are liabilities, regardless of the probability of the occurrence of the triggering event. Liability classified warrants are measured at fair value on the issuance date and at the end of each reporting period. Any change in the fair value of the warrants after the issuance date is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as a gain or loss. If warrants do not require liability classification under ASC 815-40, in order to conclude warrants should be classified as equity, the Company assesses whether the warrants are indexed to its common stock and whether the warrants are classified as equity under ASC 815-40 or other applicable GAAP. Equity classified warrants are accounted for at fair value on the issuance date with no changes in fair value recognized after the issuance date.\nOn December 8, 2020, through a private placement, we issued 10,312,500 shares of our common stock and, in lieu of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of common stock, and, in each case, accompanying warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 2,828,125 additional shares of common stock (or pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock in lieu thereof) at a price of $8.00 per share and accompanying warrant (or $7.99 per pre-funded warrant and accompanying warrant). The private placement resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of $90.5 million, before $0.4 million of transaction costs.\nIn the event of certain fundamental transactions, the holders of warrants may require us to make a payment based on a Black-Scholes valuation, using specified inputs. The holders of the pre-funded warrants issued in the December 2020 private placement do not have similar rights. Therefore, we accounted for the warrants as a liability, while the pre-funded warrants met the permanent equity criteria classification. The pre-funded warrants are classified as a component of permanent equity because they are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the shares of common stock with which they were issued, are immediately exercisable, do not embody an obligation for us to repurchase those shares, and permit the holders to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise. In addition, the Pre-Funded Warrants do not provide any guarantee of value or return. The initial fair value of the warrants at issuance was $19.3 million, determined using Black-Scholes valuation model. We remeasured the warrant's fair value at December 31, 2020 as $19.7 million. The change in fair value of $0.4 was recorded in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for our stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of restricted stock units and stock option awards, to be recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of operations based on their grant date fair values. Effective January 1, 2019, grants of restricted stock units and stock option awards to other service providers, referred to as non-employees, are measured based on the grant-date fair value of the award and expensed in our consolidated statement of operations over the vesting period. Through December 31, 2018, grants of restricted stock unit and stock option awards to non-employees were required to be recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of operations based on their vesting date fair values. We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Prior to June 30, 2016, we were a private company and, therefore, lack company-specific historical and implied volatility information. As a result, we estimate our expected stock volatility based on a combination of our historical volatility and that of a publicly traded set of peer companies. We expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our own traded stock price. The expected term of our stock options has been determined utilizing the simplified\u201d method for awards that qualify as plain-vanilla\u201d options. Through December 31, 2018, the expected term of stock options granted to non-employees was equal to the contractual term of the option award. Effective January 1, 2019, the expected term of stock options to non-employees can be determined using either the contractual term of the option award or the simplified\u201d method. We elected to continue to use the contractual term in determining the expected term of stock option to non-employees. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We use the value of our common stock to determine the fair value of restricted stock awards.\nWe expense the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees and non-employees on a straight-line basis over the associated service period, which is generally the vesting period. We account for forfeitures as they occur instead of estimating forfeitures at the time of grant. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will be for only those options that vest.\nCompensation expense for discounted purchases under the employee stock purchase plan is measured using the Black-Scholes model to compute the fair value of the lookback provision plus the purchase discount and is recognized as compensation expense over the offering period.\nFor stock-based awards that contain performance-based milestones, we record stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the accelerated attribution model. Management evaluates when the achievement of a performance-based milestone is probable based on the expected satisfaction of the performance conditions as of the reporting date. For certain of our performance-based awards, notwithstanding any vesting in accordance with the achievement of performance-based milestones, such awards vest in full on the sixth anniversary of the vesting commencement date. Compensation expense for such awards is recognized over the six-year vesting period unless management determines that the achievement of any performance-based milestones is probable, in which case expense is accelerated.\nWe have computed the fair value of stock options at the date of grant using the following weighted-average assumptions:\n\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, together with the changes in those items in dollars (in thousands):\n\nRevenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized approximately $15.1 million of revenue, $11.7 million of which was attributable to our collaboration with GBT and $3.4 million of which was attributable to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $2.0 million of revenue, all of which was attributable to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased by approximately $17.8 million, or 31%, from $58.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $76.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, together with the changes to those items in dollars (in thousands):\n\nThe change in research and development expense was primarily attributable to research and development activities associated with advancing our lead clinical and preclinical programs and enhancing our internal capabilities, and included the following:\n \u2022 an increase of approximately $12.9 million, or 43%, in external research and development, primarily attributable to the $12.0 million paid to Orsenix for the acquisition of the SY-2101, and due to the increases in costs associated with the continued advancement of our existing clinical trials of SY-5609 and SY-1425 and advancement of our preclinical programs, including our sickle cell disease development activities in collaboration with GBT; \n \u2022 an increase of approximately $3.0 million, or 19%, for employee-related expenses, including increased salary and benefits primarily due to our increased headcount; \n \u2022 an increase of approximately $1.3 million, or 36%, for stock-based compensation, also primarily due to our increased headcount; and \n \u2022 an increase of approximately $0.7 million, or 13%, in facilities and other expenses primarily due to the rent expense related to the lease for our headquarters, over which we took possession for accounting purposes in May 2019. \nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense remained consistent during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. A slight decrease in consulting and outside services fees led to a decrease in general and administrative expense of approximately $0.2 million, or 1%, from $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest income\nInterest income was derived from our investments in cash equivalents and marketable securities. The decrease in interest income during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to lower yield on our investments in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities due to capital market conditions in light of the COVID-19 pandemic during the majority of the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense was related to our credit facility with Oxford Finance, LLC, or Oxford, and equipment financing arrangements. The increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven by proceeds of $39.6 million, net of issuance costs, from our credit facility with Oxford, which was drawn in two tranches in February 2020 and December 2020.\nChange in fair value of warrant liability\nThe increase in in the change in fair value of warrant liability during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was a result of the remeasurement of the fair values of warrants issued in connection with the private placement financing in December 2020.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, together with the changes in those items in dollars (in thousands):\n\nRevenue\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized approximately $2.0 million and $2.1 million of revenue, respectively, all of which was attributable to our target discovery collaboration with Incyte.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased by approximately $8.0 million, or 16%, from $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $58.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, together with the changes to those items in dollars (in thousands):\n\nThe change in research and development expense was primarily attributable to research and development activities associated with advancing our lead clinical and preclinical programs and enhancing our internal capabilities, and included the following:\n \u2022 an increase of approximately $4.0 million, or 35%, for increased employee-related expenses, including increased salary and benefits primarily due to our increased headcount; \n \u2022 an increase of approximately $1.1 million, or 44%, for stock-based compensation, also primarily due to our increased headcount; \n \u2022 an increase of approximately $1.7 million, or 90%, for consulting, licensing and professional fees, primarily due to increased fees in support of our SY-1425, SY-1365 and SY-5609 clinical trials and our other preclinical programs; and \n \u2022 an increase of approximately $1.4 million, or 35%, in facilities and other expenses, primarily due to the rent expense related to the lease for our headquarters, over which we took possession for accounting purposes in May 2019. \nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by approximately $5.3 million, or 33% from $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to an increase in employee-related costs, including salary, benefits and stock-based compensation, primarily due to our increased headcount period over period.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was derived from our investments in cash equivalents and marketable securities. The increase in interest income from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to higher average cash balances during 2019 as compared to 2018.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was related to our equipment financing arrangements. The increase in interest expense from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019, was due to a new equipment financing lease entered into during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nWe funded our operations from inception through December 31, 2020 primarily through the sale of equity securities, through license and collaboration agreements, including those with Incyte and GBT, and through the credit facility with Oxford.\nOn February 12, 2020, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, or the Loan Agreement, with Oxford. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, a term loan of up to an aggregate principal amount of $60.0 million is available to the Company. A $20.0 million term loan was funded on February 12, 2020, and another $20.0 million term loan was funded on December 23, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, $20.0 million remains available under the Loan Agreement, at the sole discretion of Oxford.\nOn June 12, 2020, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to register for sale from time to time up to $300.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units in one or more registered offerings. The registration statement was declared effective on June 22, 2020. Further, in June 2020, we entered into an at-the-market sales agreement, or the 2020 sales agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million through Cowen pursuant to the registration statement.\nUpon entry into the 2020 sales agreement, we terminated our prior at-the-market sales facility pursuant to the original sales agreement with Cowen, dated July 20, 2017, or the 2017 sales agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued $12.3 million in common stock under the 2017 sales agreement. We did not issue any shares of common stock pursuant to the 2020 sales agreement during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $75.0 million of our common stock remained available for future issuance under the 2020 sales agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $300.0 million of securities remained available for issuance under the shelf registration statement.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $174.0 million.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\n\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nThe use of cash in all periods presented resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $57.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $60.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a $20.0 million collection of the advanced payment pursuant to our collaboration agreement with GBT, offset by higher operating expenses associated with our ongoing preclinical and clinical development activities and the asset acquisition of SY-2101 during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $60.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $40.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a $13.1 million increase in our net loss from continuing operations and proceeds received upon entry into the Incyte target discovery collaboration during the year ended December 31, 2018 that did not reoccur in 2019.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $46.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $11.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to our reinvestment of $50.0 million of our funds from marketable securities upon their maturities into cash equivalents during the year ended December 31, 2020, and our purchase of $12.6 million of property and equipment for the buildout of our corporate headquarters during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $11.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $10.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to $12.6 million of purchases of property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the buildout of our corporate headquarters during the year ending December 31, 2019. This amount was offset by net maturities of marketable securities of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to net purchases of $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $143.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $66.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was the result of net proceeds of $39.6 million drawn from our credit facility with Oxford, $90.4 million from the issuance of securities in the December 2020 private placement, $11.9 million from the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to the 2017 sales agreement, $1.1 million from the issuance of shares of our common stock through our employee benefit plan and $0.4 million from issuance of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan, offset by payments of $0.2 million under our capital lease obligations and payments of $0.2 million of offering costs. Cash provided by financing activities for year ended December 31, 2019 of $66.0 million was primarily due to $65.0 million in net proceeds raised through two concurrent public offerings of equity securities that closed in April 2019.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $66.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $69.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to $65.0 million in net proceeds raised through two concurrent public offerings of equity securities that closed in April 2019, $0.8 million in net proceeds through the use of our at-the-market sales agreement, $0.2 million in proceeds through the sale of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan, and $0.2 million in proceeds through the exercise of stock options, offset by payments of $0.2 million under our capital lease obligations. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to net proceeds of $42.8 million from the sale of our common stock in an underwritten public offering in February 2018, $1.4 million in proceeds from our February 2018 private placement, $7.7 million in proceeds attributable to the equity investment made by Incyte in connection with entry into our target discovery collaboration, $16.6 million in net proceeds through the use of our at-the-market sales facility, and $0.6 million from the exercise of employee stock options, offset by net payments under our capital lease obligations.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue to advance our clinical trials of SY-1425, SY-2101 and SY-5609, seek to develop companion diagnostic tests for use with our product candidates, initiate new research and preclinical development projects and seek marketing approval for any product candidates that we successfully develop. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to establishing sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure to commercialize such products. We will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, eliminate, or out-license our research and development programs or future commercialization rights to our product candidates.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2020, together with the net proceeds from the underwritten public offering of our common stock that closed in January 2021, will enable us to fund our planned operating expense and capital expenditure requirements into 2023.\nOur future funding requirements, both short-term and long-term, will depend on many factors, including:\n \u2022 the scope, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of SY-1425, SY-2101 and SY-5609 and any associated companion diagnostic tests; \n \u2022 research and preclinical development efforts for any future product candidates that we may develop; \n \u2022 the number of future product candidates that we pursue and their development requirements; \n \u2022 our ability to enter into, and the terms and timing of, any collaborations, licensing agreements or other arrangements; \n \u2022 whether a drug candidate will be nominated to enter investigational new drug application-enabling studies under our sickle cell disease collaboration with GBT, whether GBT will exercise its option to exclusively license intellectual property arising from the collaboration, whether and when any option exercise fees, milestone payments or royalties under the collaboration agreement with GBT will ever be paid, and whether we exercise our U.S. co-promotion option under the GBT agreement; \n \u2022 whether our target discovery collaboration with Incyte will yield any validated targets, whether Incyte will exercise any of its options to exclusively license intellectual property directed to such targets, and whether and when any of the target validation fees, option exercise fees, milestone payments or royalties under the collaboration agreement with Incyte will ever be paid; \n \u2022 the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals; \n \u2022 the costs of commercialization activities for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval to the extent such costs are not the responsibility of any future collaborators, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities; \n \u2022 the costs of acquiring potential new product candidates or technology; \n \u2022 the costs of any physician education programs relating to selecting and treating genomically defined patient populations; \n \u2022 the timing and amount of milestone and other payments due to licensors for patent and technology rights used in our gene control platform or to TMRC Co. Ltd., or TMRC, associated with the development, manufacture and commercialization of SY-1425; \n \u2022 the timing and amount of milestone payments due to Orsenix associated with the development and commercialization of SY-2101; \n \u2022 revenue received from commercial sales, if any, of our current and future product candidates; \n \u2022 our headcount growth and associated costs as we advance our research and development programs and establish a commercial infrastructure; \n \u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property related claims; and \n \u2022 the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes many years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our common stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, rules.\nJOBS Act\nIn April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company, or EGC, can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an EGC can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.\nAs an EGC, we intend to rely on the exemption from the requirement to provide an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and with the exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding\nmandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an EGC until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the closing of our IPO; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under SEC rules.", "item_7_tables": "Table 211: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td>
