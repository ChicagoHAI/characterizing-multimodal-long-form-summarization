Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods.\nOverview\nSince our inception in 1991, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to the research, development, clinical testing and commercialization of the INTERCEPT Blood System. The INTERCEPT Blood System is designed for three blood components: platelets, plasma and red blood cells. The INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets, or platelet system, and the INTERCEPT Blood System for plasma, or plasma system, have received CE marks and FDA approval and are being marketed and sold in a number of countries around the world.\nThe platelet system is approved in the U.S. for ex vivo preparation of pathogen-reduced apheresis platelet components in order to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infection, or TTI, including sepsis, and to potentially reduce the risk of transfusion-associated graft versus host disease or TA-GVHD. The plasma system is approved in the U.S. for ex vivo preparation of plasma in order to reduce the risk of TTI when treating patients requiring therapeutic plasma transfusion.\nThe INTERCEPT Blood System for red blood cells, or the red blood cell system, is currently in development and has not been commercialized anywhere in the world. We completed our European Phase III clinical trial of our red blood cell system for acute anemia patients and have another ongoing European Phase III clinical trial of our red blood cell system for chronic anemia patients. Although we plan to complete additional development activities to support an anticipated CE mark submission for the red blood cell system, such development activities, including any additional studies that may be required by the FDA prior to its review of any proposed U.S. Phase III clinical trial protocol, could prolong development of our red blood cell system, and we do not expect to receive any regulatory approvals of our red blood cell system in the next twelve months, if ever. We understand that while the acute anemia Phase III clinical trial in Europe may be sufficient to receive CE mark approval in Europe, we may need to generate additional safety data from commercial use and/or achieve a successful outcome in the ongoing chronic anemia Phase III clinical trial of our red blood cell system in order to achieve broad market acceptance. In addition, these trials may need to be supplemented by additional, successful Phase III clinical trials for approval in certain countries. If such additional Phase III clinical trials are required, they would likely need to demonstrate equivalency of INTERCEPT-treated red blood cells compared to conventional red blood cells and significantly lower lifespan for INTERCEPT-treated red blood cells compared to non-treated red blood cells may limit our ability to obtain any regulatory approvals for the red blood cell system. As part of our development activities, we will need to successfully complete a number of in vitro studies prior to receiving any regulatory approvals in Europe and we will need to successfully complete additional activities, including a license-enabling Phase III clinical trial in the U.S., prior to receiving any regulatory approvals in the U.S. Successful completion of these activities may require capital beyond that which we currently have or that may be available to us under our agreement with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, and we may be required to obtain additional capital in order to complete the development of and obtain any regulatory approvals for the red blood cell system. If we experience delays in testing, conducting trials or obtaining approvals, our product development costs will increase.\nIn 2016, we entered into a five-year agreement with BARDA, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, to receive funding of up to $41.6 million with a total funding opportunity of up to $185.0 million to support the development of our red blood cell system, including clinical and regulatory development programs in support of potential licensure, and development, manufacturing and scale-up activities, as well as activities related to broader implementation of all three INTERCEPT systems in areas of Zika virus risk. Under the contract, BARDA reimburses us as allowable direct contract costs are incurred plus allowable indirect costs. See BARDA\u201d below for more information.\nOur near-term capital requirements are dependent on various factors, including operating costs and working capital investments associated with commercializing the INTERCEPT Blood System, including in connection with the continuing U.S. commercial launch of our platelet and plasma systems, commitments to fund projects with Fresenius, costs to develop different configurations of existing products and new products, including our illuminator, costs associated with planning, enrolling and completing ongoing studies, and the post-approval studies we are required to conduct in connection with the FDA approval of the platelet system, costs associated with pursuing potential regulatory approvals in other geographies where we do not currently sell our platelet and plasma systems, costs associated with conducting in vitro studies and clinical development of our red blood cell system in Europe and the U.S., including our ongoing European Phase III clinical trial of our red blood cell system for chronic anemia patients, costs associated with performing the agreed-upon activities under our BARDA agreement, and costs related to creating, maintaining and defending our intellectual property. Our long-term capital requirements will also be dependent on the success of our sales efforts, competitive developments, the timing, costs and magnitude of our longer-term clinical trials and other development activities related to our platelet, plasma and red blood cell systems, including required post-approval studies for the platelet system, market preparedness and product launch activities\nfor any of our products in geographies where we do not currently sell our products, and regulatory factors. Until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and generate positive net cash flows from operations, which we may never do, meeting our long-term capital requirements is in large part reliant on continued access to funds under our BARDA agreement and the public and private equity and debt capital markets, as well as on collaborative arrangements with partners, augmented by cash generated from operations and interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances. We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, as well as cash received from product sales and under our agreement with BARDA, will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. We have based our cash sufficiency estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect or in excess of amounts than we currently expect, which could adversely affect our commercialization and clinical development activities.\nWe have borrowed and in the future may borrow additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund future growth, including pursuant to our loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance, as described below, or potentially pursuant to new arrangements with different lenders. We may borrow funds on terms that may include restrictive covenants, including covenants that restrict the operation of our business, liens on assets, high effective interest rates and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets. In addition, we may continue to pursue access to the equity capital markets to support our development efforts and operations. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies, grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, or issue equity that may be substantially dilutive to our stockholders.\nAs a result of economic conditions, general global economic uncertainty and other factors, we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will be able to obtain additional capital on reasonable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital due to the volatile global financial markets, general economic uncertainty or other factors, we may need to curtail planned development or commercialization activities. In addition, we may need to obtain additional funds to complete development activities for the red blood cell system necessary for potential regulatory approval in Europe, if costs are higher than anticipated or we encounter delays. We may need to obtain additional funding to conduct additional randomized controlled clinical trials for existing or new products, particularly if we are unable to access any portion of the funding contemplated by our BARDA agreement, and we may choose to defer such activities until we can obtain sufficient additional funding or, at such time, our existing operations provide sufficient cash flow to conduct these trials.\nAlthough we received FDA approval of our platelet and plasma systems in December 2014, our commercial efforts will be largely focused on implementing INTERCEPT to customers with whom we have previously signed agreements and developing awareness of INTERCEPT's product profile relative to other platelet and plasma products, including conventional, un-treated components. Significant product revenue from customers in the U.S. may not occur, if at all, until we have been able to successfully implement the platelet and plasma systems and demonstrate that they are economical, safe and efficacious for potential customers. We recognize product revenues from the sale of our platelet and plasma systems in a number of countries around the world including those in Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, or CIS, and the Middle East. If we are unable to gain widespread commercial adoption in markets where our blood safety products are approved for commercialization, including the U.S., we will have difficulties achieving profitability. In order to commercialize all of our products and product candidates, we will be required to conduct significant research, development, preclinical and clinical evaluation, commercialization and regulatory compliance activities for our products and product candidates, which, together with anticipated selling, general and administrative expenses, are expected to result in substantial losses. Accordingly, we may never achieve a profitable level of operations in the future.\nIn addition to the product revenues from sales of our platelet and plasma systems, we anticipate that we will continue to recognize revenue from our BARDA agreement. We recognize revenue associated with the BARDA agreement as qualified costs are incurred for reimbursement over the performance period.\nAduro Biotech\nWe hold an investment in Aduro Biotech Inc., or Aduro, common stock totaling 346,700 shares. Aduro trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol ADRO\u201d. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of Aduro's common stock was $11.40 per share. We account for the investment in Aduro as an available-for-sale security on our consolidated balance sheet and adjust the carrying value of this investment to fair value each quarterly reporting period with changes in fair value recorded within other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Prior to Aduro's initial public offering in April 2015, we held the investment in Aduro at zero on our consolidated balance sheet.\nFresenius\nThrough June 30, 2015, we paid royalties to Fenwal Inc., or Fenwal, a subsidiary of Fresenius Kabi AG, or Fresenius, on INTERCEPT Blood System product sales under certain agreements that arose from the sale of the transfusion therapies division of Baxter International Inc., or Baxter, in 2007 to Fenwal (Fenwal was subsequently acquired by Fresenius in 2012), at rates that varied by product: 10% of product sales for the platelet system and 3% of product sales for the plasma system. Fresenius assumed Fenwal's rights and obligations under those agreements, including our manufacturing and supply agreement. In this report, references to Fresenius include references to its predecessors-in-interest, Fenwal and Baxter.\nIn November 2013, we amended our manufacturing and supply agreement with Fresenius with the new terms effective January 1, 2014, which we refer to as the 2013 Agreement. Under the 2013 Agreement, Fresenius was obligated to sell, and we were obligated to purchase up to a certain specified annual volume of finished disposable kits for the platelet and plasma systems from Fresenius for both clinical and commercial use. Once the specified annual volume of disposable kits was purchased from Fresenius, we were able to purchase additional quantities of disposable kits from other third-party manufacturers. The amended terms also provided for fixed pricing for finished kits with successive decreasing pricing tiers at various annual production volumes. In addition, the 2013 Agreement required us to purchase additional specified annual volumes of sets if and when an additional Fresenius manufacturing site was identified and qualified to make INTERCEPT disposable kits, subject to mutual agreement on pricing for disposable kits manufactured at the additional site. Fresenius was also obligated to purchase and maintain specified inventory levels of our proprietary inactivation compounds and compound adsorption devices from us at fixed prices.\nIn October 2015, we entered into a ten year Amended and Restated Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, or the 2015 Agreement, with Fresenius, which amended and restated the 2013 Agreement. Under the 2015 Agreement, Fresenius continues to be obligated to sell and we are obligated to purchase finished disposable kits for our platelet, plasma and red blood cell systems. The 2015 Agreement permits us to purchase platelet, plasma and red blood cell systems from third parties to the extent necessary to maintain supply qualifications with such third parties or where local or regional manufacturing is needed to obtain product registrations or sales. Pricing terms are initially fixed and decline at specified annual production levels, and are subject to certain adjustments after the initial pricing term.\nUnder the 2015 Agreement, we are no longer required to make royalty payments to Fenwal for the sale of products after June 30, 2015. Under the 2015 Agreement, we maintain the amounts due from the components sold to Fresenius as a current asset on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets until such time as we purchase finished disposable kits using those components. The 2015 Agreement also requires us to make certain payments totaling \u20ac8.6 million, or the Manufacturing and Development Payments, to Fresenius in 2016 and on December 31 of the earlier of (a) the year of achievement of certain production volumes or (b) 2022. Because these payments represent unconditional payment obligations, we recognize our liability for these payments at their net present value. The Manufacturing and Development Payments liability is accreted through interest expense based on the estimated timing of its ultimate settlement. As of December 31, 2016, we had accrued $4.8 million (\u20ac4.5 million) related to the Manufacturing and Development Payments.\nThe Manufacturing and Development Payments will be made to support certain projects Fresenius will perform on our behalf related to research and development, or R&D activities and manufacturing efficiency activities. We allocated $4.8 million to R&D activities and $2.4 million to manufacturing efficiency activities based on their market value in October 2015. The prepaid asset related to amounts paid up front for the R&D activities to be conducted by Fresenius on our behalf is expensed over the period which such activities occur. The manufacturing efficiency asset is expensed on a straight line basis over the life of the 2015 Agreement.\nThe initial term of the 2015 Agreement extends through July 1, 2025, or the Initial Term, and is automatically renewed thereafter for additional two year terms, or Renewal Terms, subject to termination by either party upon (i) two years written notice prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or (ii) one year written notice prior to the expiration of any Renewal Term. Under the 2015 Agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase certain assets and assume certain liabilities from Fresenius. In the event that Fresenius refuses or is unable to continue operating under the 2015 Agreement, we may be unable to maintain inventory levels or otherwise meet customer demand, and our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.\nLikewise, if we conclude that supply of the INTERCEPT Blood System or components from Fresenius and others is uncertain, we may choose to build and maintain inventories of raw materials, work-in-process components, or finished goods, which would consume capital resources faster than we anticipate and may cause our supply chain to be less efficient. Like most regulated manufacturing processes, our ability to produce our products is dependent on our or Fresenius' ability to source components and raw materials which may at times be in short demand or obsolete. In such cases, we and/or Fresenius may need to source, qualify and obtain approval for replacement materials or components which would likely prove to be disruptive and consume capital resources sooner than we anticipate.\nBARDA\nIn June 2016, we entered into an agreement with BARDA to support our development and implementation of pathogen reduction technology for platelet, plasma, and red blood cells, including access to funding that could potentially support various activities, including funding studies necessary to support a potential PMA submission to the FDA for the red blood cell system, and acceleration of commercial scale up activities to facilitate potential adoption of the red blood cell system by U.S. blood centers.\nThe five-year agreement with BARDA includes a base period, or the Base Period, and options, or Option Periods. The five-year agreement, as amended by BARDA, and Option Periods exercised include committed funding of up to $41.6 million for clinical development of the red blood cell system and subsequent Option Periods that, if exercised by BARDA and completed, would bring the total funding opportunity to $185.0 million over the five-year agreement period. If exercised by BARDA, each subsequent option would fund activities related to broader implementation of the platelet and plasma system or the red blood cell system in areas of Zika virus risk, clinical and regulatory development programs in support of the potential licensure of the red blood cell system in the U.S., and development, manufacturing and scale-up activities for the red blood cell system. We would be responsible for co-investment of up to $15.0 million, if certain options were to be exercised. BARDA will make periodic assessments of our progress and the continuation of the agreement is based on our success in completing the required tasks under the Base Period and each Option Period (if and to the extent any Option Periods are exercised by BARDA). BARDA has rights under certain contract clauses to terminate the agreement, including the ability to terminate for convenience at any time.\nUnder the agreement, we are reimbursed and recognize revenue as qualified direct contract costs are incurred plus allowable indirect costs, based on approved provisional indirect billing rates, which permit recovery of fringe benefits, overhead and general and administrative expenses. Amounts payable under the BARDA agreement are subject to future audits at the discretion of government. These audits could result in an adjustment to revenue previously reported, which adjustments potentially could be significant.\nEquity and Debt Agreements\nCantor\nOn May 5, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement, dated August 31, 2012, as previously amended on March 21, 2014, which together we refer to as the Amended Cantor Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor, that provides for the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock over the term of the Amended Cantor Agreement having an aggregate offering price of up to $132.2 million through Cantor. Under the Amended Cantor Agreement, Cantor acts as our sales agent and receives compensation based on an aggregate of 2% of the gross proceeds on the sale price per share of our common stock. The issuance and sale of these shares by us pursuant to the Amended Cantor Agreement are deemed an at-the-market\u201d offering and are available under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. During the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, 3.5 million and zero shares, respectively, of our common stock were sold under the Amended Cantor Agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $22.0 million and zero, respectively. At December 31, 2016, we had $62.3 million of common stock available to be sold under the Amended Cantor Agreement, subject to the continued effectiveness of our current shelf registration statement or an effective replacement registration statement.\nDebt Agreement\nOn June 30, 2014, we entered into a five year loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance, or the Term Loan Agreement. On June 30, 2014, we received $10.0 million from the first tranche, or Term Loan A. On June 15, 2015, we received $10.0 million from the second tranche, or Term Loan B. On September 29, 2015, the Term Loan Agreement was amended to extend (i) the period in which the third tranche could have been drawn and (ii) the interest-only period for all advances under the Term Loan Agreement. Term Loan A bears an interest rate of 6.95%, and Term Loan B bears an interest rate of 7.01%. Term Loans A and B mature on June 1, 2019. Following the amendment to Term Loan Agreement, we were required to make interest only payments through June 2016 followed by thirty-six months of equal principal and interest payments thereafter. On July 28, 2016, the Term Loan Agreement was again amended to include an additional interest-only period for all advances under the Term Loan Agreement. As amended, we are required to make interest only payments from August 2016 through January 2017, followed by twenty-nine months of equal principal and interest payments thereafter. We are also required to make a final payment equal to 7% of the principal amounts of the Term Loans drawn payable on the earlier to occur of maturity or prepayment. We pledged all current and future assets, excluding our intellectual property and 35% of our investment in our subsidiary, Cerus Europe B.V., as security for borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement. The Term Loan Agreement contains certain nonfinancial covenants, with which we were in compliance at December 31, 2016. For additional discussion on the Term Loan Agreement, see Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements-Debt.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies and Management Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, certain accrued liabilities, valuation and impairment of purchased intangibles and goodwill, valuation of stock options under share-based payments, valuation allowance of our deferred tax assets and uncertain income tax positions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:\n\u2022 Revenue-We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 605-25, Revenue Recognition - Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,\u201d as applicable. Revenue is recognized when (i) persuasive evidence of the agreement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) pricing is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured.\nRevenue related to product sales is generally recognized when we fulfill our obligations for each element of an agreement. For all sales of our INTERCEPT Blood System products, we use a binding purchase order or signed sales contract as evidence of a written agreement. We sell our platelet and plasma systems directly to blood banks, hospitals, universities, government agencies, as well as to distributors in certain regions. Generally, our contracts with our customers do not provide for open return rights, except within a reasonable time after receipt of goods in the case of defective or non-conforming product. For revenue arrangements with multiple elements, we determine whether the delivered elements meet the criteria as separate units of accounting. Such criteria require that the deliverable have stand-alone value to the customer and that if a general right of return exists relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in the control. Once we determine if the deliverable meets the criteria for a separate unit of accounting, we must determine how the consideration should be allocated between the deliverables and how the separate units of accounting should be recognized as revenue. Consideration received is allocated to elements that are identified as discrete units of accounting. Because we have no vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for our systems, the allocation of revenue is based on best estimated selling price for the platelet and plasma systems sold. The objective of best estimated selling price is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale, had the product been sold on a stand-alone basis. We determine best estimated selling price for our platelet and plasma systems by considering multiple factors.\n\u2022 Government contracts revenue - Revenue related to the cost reimbursement provisions under our BARDA agreement is recognized as the allowable direct contract costs plus allowable indirect costs are incurred based on approved provisional indirect billing rates, which permit recovery of fringe benefits, overhead and general and administrative expenses. Direct costs incurred under cost reimbursable contracts are recorded as research and development expenses or general and administrative expenses. Payments to us pursuant to our BARDA agreement are provisional payments subject to adjustment upon audit by the government. These audits could result in an adjustment to revenue previously reported, which adjustments potentially could be significant. Management believes that revenue for periods not yet audited has been recorded in amounts that are expected to be realized upon final audit and settlement. When the final determination of the allowable costs for any year has been made, revenue and billings may be adjusted accordingly in the period that the adjustment is known.\n\u2022 Inventories-We own certain components of INTERCEPT disposable kits in the form of work-in-process inventory and finished goods, UVA illuminators, and certain replacement parts for our illuminators. While it is not customary for our inventory production cycle to exceed twelve months, our supply chain for certain of these components, held as work-in-process on our consolidated balance sheets, could potentially take in excess of one year to complete production before being utilized in finished INTERCEPT disposable kits. We maintain an inventory balance based on our current sales projections, and at each reporting period, we evaluate whether our work-in-process inventory will be consumed in production of finished units in order to sell to existing and prospective customers within the next twelve-month period. We use judgment to factor in lead times for the production of our finished units to meet forecasted demands. If actual results differ from those estimates, work-in-process inventory could potentially accumulate for periods exceeding one year.\nInventory is recorded at the lower of cost, determined on a first in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Our platelet and plasma systems' disposable kits generally have a two-year shelf life from the date of manufacture.\nIlluminators and replacement parts do not have regulated expiration dates. We use significant judgment to analyze and determine if the composition of our inventory is obsolete, slow-moving, or unsalable and frequently review such determinations. We write-down\nspecifically identified unusable, obsolete, slow-moving, or known unsalable inventory that has no alternative use in the period that it is first recognized by using a number of factors including product expiration dates, open and unfulfilled orders, and sales forecasts. Any write-down of our inventory to net realizable value establishes a new cost basis and will be maintained even if certain circumstances suggest that the inventory is recoverable in subsequent periods. Costs associated with the write-down of inventory are recorded in Cost of product revenue\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\u2022 Accrued liabilities-We record accrued liabilities for expenses related to certain contract research activities and development services, including those related to clinical trials, preclinical safety studies and external laboratory studies, as well as development activities being performed by third parties. Some of those accrued liabilities are based on estimates because billings for these activities may not occur on a timely basis consistent with the performance of the services. Specifically, accruals for clinical trials require us to make estimates surrounding costs associated with patients at various stages of the clinical trial, pass through costs to clinical sites, contract research organization costs including fees, database development, and reporting costs, among others.\n\u2022 Goodwill and intangible assets-In August 2010, we acquired certain assets from BioOne. We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations.\u201d In connection with the acquisition, we used significant judgment, including, but not limited to, judgments as to cash flows, discount rates, and economic lives, in identifying the assets acquired and in determining the fair values to record the purchased assets on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, under ASC Topic 805, we were required to assess the fair value of the non-controlling interest that we held in BioOne prior to the acquisition. We determined that a considerable amount of the purchase consideration was goodwill, which represents value unique to us as the holder of worldwide rights to the INTERCEPT Blood System. We may be unable to realize the recorded value of the acquired assets and our assumptions may prove to be incorrect, which may require us to write-down or impair the value of the assets if and when facts and circumstances indicate a need to do so. We perform an impairment test on our goodwill annually on August 31 of each fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, we must then proceed with performing the quantitative two-step process to test goodwill for impairment; otherwise, goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is warranted. We may choose not to perform the qualitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment and proceed directly to the quantitative two-step process; however, we may revert to the qualitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment in any subsequent period. The first step of the two-step process compares the fair value of each reporting unit with the respective carrying amount, including goodwill. We have determined that we operate in one reporting unit and estimate the fair value of our one reporting unit using the enterprise approach under which we consider our quoted market capitalization as reported on the Nasdaq Global Market. We consider quoted market prices that are available in active markets to be the best evidence of fair value. We also consider other factors, which include future forecasted results, the economic environment and overall market conditions. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and, therefore, the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. The second step of the two-step process, which is used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of each reporting unit's goodwill with the respective carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. On August 31, 2016, we performed our annual review of goodwill as described above and determined that goodwill was not impaired during the year ended December 31, 2016. We will continue to monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of our intangible assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, we then measure the amount of the impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. No events or changes in circumstances arose during the year ended December 31, 2016, which would require us to test the recoverability of our intangible assets.\n\u2022 Stock-based compensation-We issue stock-based awards to our employees, contractors and members of our Board of Directors, as strategic, long-term incentives. We also maintain an active employee stock purchase plan within the meaning of Section 423(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. We record stock-based compensation expense for employee awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation.\u201d We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires that we use assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables to determine appropriate inputs to the model, which include the expected term of the grants, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, including forfeitures, our expected stock price volatility, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The grant-date fair value of stock-based awards is then recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period, and is adjusted for estimated forfeitures. To the extent that stock options contain performance criteria for vesting, stock-based compensation is recognized once the performance criteria are probable of being achieved.\nWe apply the provisions of ASC Topic 505-50, Equity Based Payment to Non-Employees\u201d for our stock-based awards issued to non-employees. Under those provisions, the measurement date at which the fair value of the stock-based award is measured is the earlier of\n(i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the grantee to earn the equity instrument is reached or (ii) the date at which the grantee's performance is complete.\n\u2022 Income taxes-Since our inception, we have accumulated significant net operating losses and research and development credits that may be used in future periods to offset future taxable income. We currently estimate that we may not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets. In addition, we may not generate future taxable income prior to the expiration of our net operating loss carry forwards and research and development credits. Timing and significance of any estimated future taxable income is highly subjective and is beyond the control of management due to uncertainties in market conditions, economic environments in which we operate, and timing of regulatory approval of our products. We do not recognize tax positions that do not have a greater than 50% likelihood of being recognized upon review by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Use of a valuation allowance is not an appropriate substitute for the derecognition of a tax position. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax expense. To date, we have not recognized any interest and penalties in our consolidated statements of operations, nor have we accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties. We continue to carry a full valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets. Although we believe it more likely than not that a taxing authority would agree with our current tax positions, there can be no assurance that the tax positions we have taken will be substantiated by a taxing authority if reviewed. Our U.S. federal tax returns from 1998 through 2015 and all our California tax returns through 2015 remain subject to examination by the taxing jurisdictions due to unutilized net operating losses and research credits.\nResults of Operations\nYears Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014\nRevenue\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Government contracts revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct revenue increased by $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, attributable mainly to increased illuminator sales primarily in the U.S market and increased sales volume of disposable platelet and plasma system kits in our European and Middle Eastern markets.\nProduct revenue decreased by $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The primary driver for the decline in reported product revenue was the weakening of the average Euro relative to our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, of approximately 16% during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During the periods presented, most of our product revenue was invoiced and transacted in Euros with reported revenue in U.S. dollars. The decrease in product revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 was partially offset by a higher unit sales volume of our disposable platelet and plasma system kits of 15%.\nWe anticipate product revenue will increase in future periods as the INTERCEPT Blood System gains market acceptance in geographies where commercialization efforts are underway, including anticipated contribution from U.S. sales and newly accessible geographies. However, deterioration in the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar and continued general declines in the economic climate in Russia and the CIS markets would adversely impact product revenue as the majority of our revenues are expected to come from Euro denominated markets and the CIS markets. As a result of these and other factors, the historical results may not be indicative of INTERCEPT Blood System revenue in the future.\nWe recognized $2.1 million revenue from our BARDA agreement during the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of the direct and indirect contract costs incurred in the Base Period and certain Option Periods under the BARDA agreement. We did not recognize any revenue from our BARDA agreement during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nCost of Product Revenue\nOur cost of product revenue consists of the cost of the INTERCEPT Blood System inventory sold; provisions for obsolete, slow-moving and unsaleable product; certain order fulfillment costs, to the extent applicable, costs for idle facilities, and, prior to October 19, 2015, royalties payable to Fenwal for product sales. Inventory is accounted for on a first-in, first-out basis.\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of product revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of product revenue decreased by $3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of the elimination of the royalty to Fenwal in the fourth quarter of 2015 and decreased obsolescence and manufacturing charges in 2016 compared to the prior year.\nCost of product revenue increased by $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily the result of higher unit sales volume and increase of $1.8 million in obsolescence and manufacturing charges, partially offset by inventory produced during periods of more favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Similar to our revenues, during the periods presented, a significant majority of our product was sourced from vendors transacting in Euros and reported by us in U.S. dollars. Per unit cost of product sold declined by 11.4% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014.\nOur realized gross margin on product sales was 45% during the year ended December 31, 2016, up from 31% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in gross margins on product sales was primarily due to the elimination of the royalty to Fenwal in the fourth quarter of 2015, decreased obsolescence and manufacturing charges, increased illuminator sales, and efficiencies realized related to inventory management during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOur gross margin on product sales was 31% during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 42% during the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in gross margins on product sales, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily due to the deterioration in the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar on current period revenues and increased obsolescence and manufacturing charges, partially offset by the impact on cost of revenues which were recorded at more favorable foreign exchange rates in effect at the time the inventory was purchased. In addition, increased period charges for outdated product also resulted in the overall decreases in gross margins during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nChanges in our gross margins are affected by various factors, including the exchange rate of the Euro relative to the U.S dollar, manufacturing and supply chain costs, the mix of product sold, and the mix of customers to which product is sold. Generally, we offer our distributors tiered volume discounts of varying magnitudes, depending on their annual purchases. We may encounter unforeseen manufacturing difficulties which, at a minimum, may lead to higher than anticipated costs, scrap rates, or delays in manufacturing products. In addition, we may face competition which may limit our ability to maintain existing selling prices for our products which in turn would negatively affect our reported gross margins. Our gross margins may be impacted in the future based on all of these criteria.\nWe expect to maintain inventory levels that will be sufficient to meet forecasted demand for a relatively short time period and plan to manufacture at levels above those produced in 2016.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses include salaries and related expenses for our scientific personnel, non-cash stock based compensation, payments to consultants, costs to prepare and conduct preclinical and clinical trials, third-party costs for development activities, certain regulatory costs, costs associated with our facility related infrastructure, and laboratory chemicals and supplies.\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses increased by $5.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to increased costs associated with clinical development of our red blood cell system, our pursuit of PMA supplement approvals for the platelet and plasma systems, and the initial activities under the BARDA agreement.\nResearch and development expenses increased by $3.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increased costs associated with pursuing potential label claim extensions for the platelet system in the U.S., conducting our IDE studies, development of a new generation of our illuminator, and development activities for our red blood cell program.\nWe expect to incur additional research and development costs associated with planning, enrolling and completing our required post-approval studies for the platelet system, pursuing potential regulatory approvals in other geographies where we do not currently sell our platelet and plasma systems, planning and conducting in vitro studies and clinical development of our red blood cell system in Europe and the U.S., completing activities to support a potential CE mark submission for our red blood cell system in Europe, and costs associated with performing the activities under our BARDA agreement. Due to the inherent uncertainties and risks associated with developing biomedical products, including, but not limited to, intense and changing government regulation, uncertainty of future preclinical studies and clinical trial results and uncertainty associated with manufacturing, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the costs to complete these research and development projects. We face numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the successful completion of our research and development projects, which risks and uncertainties are discussed in further detail under Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses include salaries and related expenses for administrative personnel, non-cash stock based compensation, expenses for our commercialization efforts in a number of countries around the world including those in U.S., Europe, the CIS and the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, and expenses for accounting, tax, internal control, legal, facility and infrastructure related expenses, and insurance premiums.\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $2.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to increased spending related to general corporate activities associated with the increased commercial activities targeting and servicing new and potential U.S. customers and the development activities under BARDA agreement.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $8.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increased spending related to activities associated with the U.S. launch of our plasma and platelet products which increased over the course of 2015 and to a lesser extent, increases in back-office support functions.\nWe anticipate our selling, general, and administrative spending to increase over the coming year, as we as we undertake additional activities associated with performing the activities under our BARDA agreement and continue to on-board commercial capabilities in the U.S., including incremental back-office support, sales and marketing personnel, as well as medical science liaisons to educate hospital and physicians on our products and drive hospital demand for INTERCEPT-treated blood components.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets relates to a license to commercialize the INTERCEPT Blood System in certain Asian countries. These intangible assets are being amortized over an estimated useful life of ten years and will be reviewed for impairment.\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmortization of intangible assets remained flat during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, as there were no changes to the composition of our intangible assets or the assumptions used to determine the useful lives. In addition, no impairment charges were recognized related to our intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nWe expect that the amortization of our intangible assets to remain relatively consistent in future periods, unless facts and circumstances arise which may result in our intangible assets being impaired.\nNon-Operating (Expense) Income, Net\nNon-operating (expense) income, net consists of mark-to-market adjustments related to the calculated fair value of our previously-outstanding warrants, foreign exchange gain (loss), interest charges incurred on our debt, and other non-operating gains and losses, including interest earned from our short-term investment portfolio.\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain from revaluation of warrant liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (54\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign exchange gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (396\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,296\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (105\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (69\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,445\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,705\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (599\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,506\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-operating (expense) income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,284\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (184\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (74\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWarrant liability\nIn August 2009 and November 2010, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2.4 million and 3.7 million shares of common stock, respectively, in connection with offerings of our common stock. In August 2014 and November of 2015, all of the outstanding August 2009 and November 2010 warrants, respectively, were exercised. The fair value of the outstanding warrants, which used the Black-Scholes model, was classified as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet and was adjusted at each subsequent reporting period, until such time the warrants were exercised. Upon exercise, the fair value of the warrants was reclassified from liabilities to stockholders' equity. We had no outstanding warrants during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nWe recorded a non-cash gain from the revaluation of the warrant liability of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a non-cash gain of $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This change is primarily due to the change in our underlying stock price as compared to the strike price of the warrants and the exercise of warrants during the current year.\nForeign exchange gain (loss)\nWe recorded a foreign exchange gain of less than $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a foreign exchange loss during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily attributable to favorable foreign currency variations between the Euro and U.S. dollar during the current year compared to unfavorable variations in the prior.\nForeign exchange loss decreased to $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a loss of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily attributable to stabilization of foreign currency variations between the Euro and U.S. dollar, our functional currency, in 2015 as compared to the Euro and U.S. dollar exchange rates in 2014.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased by $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, and increased by $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a higher effective interest rate and larger average outstanding debt balance under our Term Loan Agreement (see discussion under the heading Debt\u201d below), resulting from the drawdown of Term Loan B of $10.0 million in June 2015.\nOther income, net\nOther income, net increased by $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the realized gain from the sale of 50,000 shares of our Aduro common stock, and the increased interest income from our investments in marketable securities.\nOther income, net remained consistent during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,671\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (105\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,983\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a tax expense of $0.2 million, which was a result of our Cerus Europe B.V. subsidiary's operating profit.\nThe tax benefit of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the result of the increased value of our Aduro investment investments. The tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily consisted of foreign taxes of our wholly-owned subsidiary headquartered in Europe.\nWe do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations as we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. Due to our history of cumulative operating losses, management has concluded that, after considering all the available objective evidence, it is not likely that all our net deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, all of our U.S. deferred tax assets continue to be subject to a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn recent years, our sources of capital have primarily consisted of public issuance of common stock, debt instruments, and to a lesser extent, contribution from product sales and proceeds from government contracts.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $22.6 million, compared to $71.0 million at December 31, 2015. Our cash equivalents primarily consist of money market instruments, which are classified for accounting purposes as available-for-sale. In addition, we had $49.1 million of short-term investments and investments in marketable equity securities at December 31, 2016, and $36.9 million at December 31, 2015. We also had total indebtedness under our Term Loan Agreement of approximately $19.4 million at December 31, 2016, and $19.8 million at December 31, 2015. Excess cash is typically invested in highly liquid instruments of short-term investments with high-quality credit rated corporate and government agency fixed-income securities in accordance with our investment policy. At December 31, 2016, our $4.0 million investment in marketable equity securities related solely to our investment in Aduro.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $53.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $51.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily related to the increased cash spent for development activities for our red blood cell program and selling and administrative expenses related to our continuing U.S. commercial launch of our platelet and plasma systems, partially offset by a net increase in the combined total for our accounts payable and accrued liabilities as a result of the timing of payments during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was also impacted by payments to Fresenius related to the Manufacturing and Development Payments, and an increased inventory build during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the corresponding period in 2015.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $51.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $39.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily related to the level of cash spent for development activities for our red blood cell program, support of our expanded use IDE for treatment of platelets, and selling and administrative expenses related to the U.S. commercial launch of our platelet and plasma systems. Also contributing to this increase in net cash used in operating activities were changes in working capital resulting from a decrease in our accounts payable due to the accelerated timing of payments, coupled with an increase in accounts receivable during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the corresponding period in 2014.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.5 million of net cash provided during the year ended December 31, 2015. The change period over period was primarily the result of lower proceeds from maturities of investments in marketable securities during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of 50,000 shares of Aduro common stock.\nNet cash provided in investing activities was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $3.1 million of net cash used during the year ended December 31, 2014. The change was primarily the result of maturities of short term investments in excess of purchases of short term investments, and fewer capital expenditures in 2015.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $24.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $98.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the decrease of proceeds received from public offerings. In January 2015, we issued 14.6 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering for approximately $75.3 million. This was further impacted by our drawdown of Term Loan B of $10.0 million in June 2015 and the proceeds from the exercise of warrants in 2015.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $98.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $36.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the proceeds received from our January 2015 public offering of common stock. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $75.3 million, net of underwriting discounts and other issuance costs. Net cash provided from financing activities was further increased by our drawdown of Term Loan B of $10.0 million in June 2015. This was partially offset by the lack of issuances of our common stock pursuant to the Amended Cantor Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital decreased to $67.2 million at December 31, 2016, from $108.5 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to the cash used to support ongoing operations which resulted in lower cash and cash equivalent balances, and the decline of the market value of our investment in Aduro. Working capital increased to $108.5 million at December 31, 2015, from $45.7 million at December 31, 2014, primarily due to funds received from the January 2015 public offering, our drawdown of Term Loan B of $10.0 million in June 2015, and the valuation of our equity investment in Aduro common stock resulting from Aduro's initial public offering in April 2015, coupled with a decrease in our warrant liability. These increases were partially offset by cash used in operations during 2015.\nCapital Requirements\nOur near-term capital requirements are dependent on various factors, including operating costs and working capital investments associated with commercializing the INTERCEPT Blood System, including in connection with the continuing U.S. commercial launch of our platelet and plasma systems, commitments to fund projects with Fresenius, costs to develop different configurations of existing products and new products, including our illuminator, costs associated with planning, enrolling and completing ongoing studies, and the post-approval studies we are required to conduct in connection with the FDA approval of the platelet system, costs associated with pursuing potential regulatory approvals in other geographies where we do not currently sell our platelet and plasma systems, costs associated with conducting in vitro studies and clinical development of our red blood cell system in Europe and the U.S., including our ongoing European Phase III clinical trial of our red blood cell system for chronic anemia patients, costs associated with performing the agreed-upon activities under our BARDA agreement, and costs related to creating, maintaining and defending our intellectual property. Our long-term capital requirements will also be dependent on the success of our sales efforts, competitive developments, the timing, costs and magnitude of our longer-term clinical trials and other development activities related to our platelet, plasma and red blood cell systems, including required post-approval studies for the platelet system, market preparedness and product launch activities for any of our products in geographies where we do not currently sell our products, and regulatory factors. Until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and generate positive net cash flows from operations, which we may never do, meeting our long-term capital requirements is in large part reliant on continued access to funds under our BARDA agreement and the public and private equity and debt capital markets, as well as on collaborative arrangements with partners, augmented by cash generated from operations and interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances. We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, as well as cash to be received from product sales and under our agreement with BARDA, will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. We have based our cash sufficiency estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect or in excess of amounts than we currently expect, which could adversely affect our commercialization and clinical development activities.\nWe have borrowed and in the future may borrow additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund future growth, including pursuant to our loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance, as described below. We may borrow funds on terms that may include restrictive covenants, including covenants that restrict the operation of our business, liens on assets, high effective interest rates and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets. In addition, we expect to continue to opportunistically seek access to the equity capital markets to support our development efforts and operations. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies, grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, or issue equity that may be substantially dilutive to our stockholders.\nWhile we expect to receive significant funding under our five-year agreement with BARDA, our ability to obtain the funding we expect to receive under the agreement is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including with respect to BARDA's ability to terminate the agreement for convenience at any time. In addition, access to federal contracts is subject to the authorization of funds and approval of our research plans by various organizations within the federal government, including the U.S. Congress. The general economic environment, coupled with tight federal budgets, has led to a general decline in the amount available for government funding. If BARDA were to eliminate, reduce or delay funding under our agreement, this would have a significant negative impact on the programs associated with such funding and could have a significant negative impact on our revenues and cash flows. In addition, if we are unable to reach agreement with the FDA on a license-enabling Phase III clinical trial design for our red blood cell system, our agreement with BARDA will be severely limited in scope or could be terminated altogether, and our ability to complete the development activities required for licensure in the U.S. may require additional capital beyond which we currently have. If alternative sources of funding are not available, we may be forced to suspend or terminate development activities related to the red blood cell system in the U.S.\nAs a result of economic conditions, general global economic uncertainty and other factors, we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will be able to obtain additional capital on reasonable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital due to the volatile global financial markets, general economic uncertainty or other factors, we may need to curtail planned development or commercialization activities. In addition, we may need to obtain additional funds to complete development activities for the red blood cell system necessary for potential regulatory approval in Europe, if costs are higher than anticipated or we encounter delays. We may need to obtain additional funding to conduct additional randomized controlled clinical trials for existing or new products, particularly if we are unable to access any portion of the funding contemplated by our BARDA agreement, and we may choose to defer such activities until we can obtain sufficient additional funding or, at such time, our existing operations provide sufficient cash flow to conduct these trials.\nOther Information\nOn May 5, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement, dated August 31, 2012, as previously amended on March 21, 2014, which together we refer to as the Amended Cantor Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor, that provides for the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock over the term of the Amended Cantor Agreement having an aggregate offering price of up to $132.2 million through Cantor. Under the Amended Cantor Agreement, Cantor acts as our sales agent and receives compensation based on an aggregate of 2% of the gross proceeds on the sale price per share of our common stock. The issuance and sale of these shares by us pursuant to the Amended Cantor Agreement are deemed an at-the-market\u201d offering and are available under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. During the year ended December 31, 2016, 3.5 million shares of our common stock were sold under the Amended Cantor Agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $22.0 million. At December 31, 2016, we had $62.3 million of common stock available to be sold under the Amended Cantor Agreement, subject to the continued effectiveness of our current shelf registration statement or an effective replacement registration statement.\nCommitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nContractual Commitments\nThe following summarizes our contractual commitments at December 31, 2016:\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Minimum purchase requirements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Manufacturing and development obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMinimum purchase requirements\nOur minimum purchase commitments include certain components of our INTERCEPT Blood System which we purchase from third party manufacturers.\nManufacturing and development obligations\nOn October 19, 2015, we entered into the 2015 Agreement with Fresenius. The 2015 Agreement calls for a remaining payment of $5.8 million (\u20ac5.5 million) on December 31 of the year in which certain production volumes are achieved, or December 31, 2022, whichever occurs first. We expect to achieve and the table above assumes that we achieve, the production threshold in 2019.\nOperating leases\nWe generally lease our office facilities and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with initial terms in excess of one year that require us to pay operating costs, property taxes, insurance and maintenance. The operating leases expire at various dates through 2021, with certain of the leases providing for renewal options, provisions for adjusting future lease payments, which is based on the consumer price index and the right to terminate the lease early. Our leased facilities qualify as operating leases under ASC Topic 840, Leases\u201d and as such, are not included on our consolidated balance sheets.\nOther commitments\nOur other commitments primarily consist of obligations for business insurance financing and the landlord financed leasehold improvements, which are in addition to the operating leases we have for office and laboratory space and consulting fees. We pay for the financed leasehold improvements as a component of rent and are required to reimburse our landlords over the remaining life of the respective leases. At December 31, 2016, we had an outstanding liability of $0.5 million related to the remaining payments for the financed business insurance and the $0.4 million related to these leasehold improvements.\nDebt\nOn June 30, 2014, we entered into the Term Loan Agreement with Oxford Finance. On June 30, 2014, we received $10.0 million from Term Loan A. On June 15, 2015, we received $10.0 million from Term Loan B. On September 29, 2015, the Term Loan Agreement was amended to extend the period in which the third tranche could have been drawn and the interest-only period for all advances under the Term Loan Agreement. Term Loan A bears an interest rate of 6.95%, and Term Loan B bears an interest rate of 7.01%. Term Loans A and B mature on June 1, 2019. Following the amendment, we were required to make interest only payments through June 2016 followed by thirty-six months of equal principal and interest payments thereafter. We are also required to make a final payment equal to 7% of the principal amounts of the Term Loans drawn payable on the earlier to occur of maturity or prepayment. The costs associated with the final payment are recognized as interest expense over the principal life of the Term Loans. We may prepay the Term Loans subject to declining prepayment fees over the term of the Term Loan Agreement. The Term Loan Agreement contains certain nonfinancial covenants, with which we were in compliance at December 31, 2016. We pledged all current and future assets, excluding our intellectual property and 35% of our investment in our subsidiary, Cerus Europe B.V., as security for borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement. All principal and interest payments related to Term Loan have been included in the table above.\nOn July 28, 2016, the Term Loan Agreement was amended to include an additional interest-only period for all advances under the Term Loan Agreement. As amended, we are required to make interest only payments from August 2016 through January 2017 followed by twenty-nine months of equal principal and interest payments thereafter.\nFinancial Instruments\nOur investment policy is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio to assist us in funding our operations. We currently invest our cash and cash equivalents in money market funds and interest-bearing accounts with financial institutions. Our money market funds are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, in which quoted prices are available in active markets, as the maturity of money market funds are relatively short and the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Our marketable equity securities consist of our investment in Aduro and are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, as quoted price in active markets is readily available. Our available-for-sale securities related to corporate debt and U.S. government agency securities are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, which uses observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. We maintain portfolio liquidity by ensuring that the securities have active secondary or resale markets. We did not record any other-than-temporary impairment losses during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Adverse global economic conditions have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on the market values of potential investments.\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods.\nOverview\nSince our inception in 1991, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to the research, development, clinical testing and commercialization of the INTERCEPT Blood System. The INTERCEPT Blood System is designed for three blood components: platelets, plasma and red blood cells. The INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets, or platelet system, and the INTERCEPT Blood System for plasma, or plasma system, have received CE marks and FDA approval and are being marketed and sold in a number of countries around the world.\nThe platelet system is approved in the U.S. for ex vivo preparation of pathogen-reduced apheresis platelet components in order to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infection, or TTI, including sepsis, and to potentially reduce the risk of transfusion-associated graft versus host disease or TA-GVHD. The plasma system is approved in the U.S. for ex vivo preparation of plasma in order to reduce the risk of TTI when treating patients requiring therapeutic plasma transfusion.\nThe INTERCEPT Blood System for red blood cells, or the red blood cell system, is currently in development and has not been commercialized anywhere in the world. We completed our European Phase III clinical trial of our red blood cell system for acute anemia patients and have another ongoing European Phase III clinical trial of our red blood cell system for chronic anemia patients. Although we plan to complete additional development activities to support an anticipated CE mark submission for the red blood cell system, such development activities, including any additional studies that may be required by the FDA prior to its review of any proposed U.S. Phase III clinical trial protocol, could prolong development of our red blood cell system, and we do not expect to receive any regulatory approvals of our red blood cell system in the next twelve months, if ever. We understand that while the acute anemia Phase III clinical trial in Europe may be sufficient to receive CE mark approval in Europe, we may need to generate additional safety data from commercial use and/or achieve a successful outcome in the ongoing chronic anemia Phase III clinical trial of our red blood cell system in order to achieve broad market acceptance. In addition, these trials may need to be supplemented by additional, successful Phase III clinical trials for approval in certain countries. If such additional Phase III clinical trials are required, they would likely need to demonstrate equivalency of INTERCEPT-treated red blood cells compared to conventional red blood cells and significantly lower lifespan for INTERCEPT-treated red blood cells compared to non-treated red blood cells may limit our ability to obtain any regulatory approvals for the red blood cell system. As part of our development activities, we will need to successfully complete a number of in vitro studies prior to receiving any regulatory approvals in Europe and we will need to successfully complete additional activities, including a license-enabling Phase III clinical trial in the U.S., prior to receiving any regulatory approvals in the U.S. Successful completion of these activities may require capital beyond that which we currently have or that may be available to us under our agreement with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, and we may be required to obtain additional capital in order to complete the development of and obtain any regulatory approvals for the red blood cell system. If we experience delays in testing, conducting trials or obtaining approvals, our product development costs will increase.\nIn 2016, we entered into a five-year agreement with BARDA, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, to receive funding of up to $41.6 million with a total funding opportunity of up to $185.0 million to support the development of our red blood cell system, including clinical and regulatory development programs in support of potential licensure, and development, manufacturing and scale-up activities, as well as activities related to broader implementation of all three INTERCEPT systems in areas of Zika virus risk. Under the contract, BARDA reimburses us as allowable direct contract costs are incurred plus allowable indirect costs. See BARDA\u201d below for more information.\nOur near-term capital requirements are dependent on various factors, including operating costs and working capital investments associated with commercializing the INTERCEPT Blood System, including in connection with the continuing U.S. commercial launch of our platelet and plasma systems, commitments to fund projects with Fresenius, costs to develop different configurations of existing products and new products, including our illuminator, costs associated with planning, enrolling and completing ongoing studies, and the post-approval studies we are required to conduct in connection with the FDA approval of the platelet system, costs associated with pursuing potential regulatory approvals in other geographies where we do not currently sell our platelet and plasma systems, costs associated with conducting in vitro studies and clinical development of our red blood cell system in Europe and the U.S., including our ongoing European Phase III clinical trial of our red blood cell system for chronic anemia patients, costs associated with performing the agreed-upon activities under our BARDA agreement, and costs related to creating, maintaining and defending our intellectual property. Our long-term capital requirements will also be dependent on the success of our sales efforts, competitive developments, the timing, costs and magnitude of our longer-term clinical trials and other development activities related to our platelet, plasma and red blood cell systems, including required post-approval studies for the platelet system, market preparedness and product launch activities\nfor any of our products in geographies where we do not currently sell our products, and regulatory factors. Until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and generate positive net cash flows from operations, which we may never do, meeting our long-term capital requirements is in large part reliant on continued access to funds under our BARDA agreement and the public and private equity and debt capital markets, as well as on collaborative arrangements with partners, augmented by cash generated from operations and interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances. We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, as well as cash received from product sales and under our agreement with BARDA, will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. We have based our cash sufficiency estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect or in excess of amounts than we currently expect, which could adversely affect our commercialization and clinical development activities.\nWe have borrowed and in the future may borrow additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund future growth, including pursuant to our loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance, as described below, or potentially pursuant to new arrangements with different lenders. We may borrow funds on terms that may include restrictive covenants, including covenants that restrict the operation of our business, liens on assets, high effective interest rates and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets. In addition, we may continue to pursue access to the equity capital markets to support our development efforts and operations. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies, grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, or issue equity that may be substantially dilutive to our stockholders.\nAs a result of economic conditions, general global economic uncertainty and other factors, we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will be able to obtain additional capital on reasonable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital due to the volatile global financial markets, general economic uncertainty or other factors, we may need to curtail planned development or commercialization activities. In addition, we may need to obtain additional funds to complete development activities for the red blood cell system necessary for potential regulatory approval in Europe, if costs are higher than anticipated or we encounter delays. We may need to obtain additional funding to conduct additional randomized controlled clinical trials for existing or new products, particularly if we are unable to access any portion of the funding contemplated by our BARDA agreement, and we may choose to defer such activities until we can obtain sufficient additional funding or, at such time, our existing operations provide sufficient cash flow to conduct these trials.\nAlthough we received FDA approval of our platelet and plasma systems in December 2014, our commercial efforts will be largely focused on implementing INTERCEPT to customers with whom we have previously signed agreements and developing awareness of INTERCEPT's product profile relative to other platelet and plasma products, including conventional, un-treated components. Significant product revenue from customers in the U.S. may not occur, if at all, until we have been able to successfully implement the platelet and plasma systems and demonstrate that they are economical, safe and efficacious for potential customers. We recognize product revenues from the sale of our platelet and plasma systems in a number of countries around the world including those in Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, or CIS, and the Middle East. If we are unable to gain widespread commercial adoption in markets where our blood safety products are approved for commercialization, including the U.S., we will have difficulties achieving profitability. In order to commercialize all of our products and product candidates, we will be required to conduct significant research, development, preclinical and clinical evaluation, commercialization and regulatory compliance activities for our products and product candidates, which, together with anticipated selling, general and administrative expenses, are expected to result in substantial losses. Accordingly, we may never achieve a profitable level of operations in the future.\nIn addition to the product revenues from sales of our platelet and plasma systems, we anticipate that we will continue to recognize revenue from our BARDA agreement. We recognize revenue associated with the BARDA agreement as qualified costs are incurred for reimbursement over the performance period.\nAduro Biotech\nWe hold an investment in Aduro Biotech Inc., or Aduro, common stock totaling 346,700 shares. Aduro trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol ADRO\u201d. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of Aduro's common stock was $11.40 per share. We account for the investment in Aduro as an available-for-sale security on our consolidated balance sheet and adjust the carrying value of this investment to fair value each quarterly reporting period with changes in fair value recorded within other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Prior to Aduro's initial public offering in April 2015, we held the investment in Aduro at zero on our consolidated balance sheet.\nFresenius\nThrough June 30, 2015, we paid royalties to Fenwal Inc., or Fenwal, a subsidiary of Fresenius Kabi AG, or Fresenius, on INTERCEPT Blood System product sales under certain agreements that arose from the sale of the transfusion therapies division of Baxter International Inc., or Baxter, in 2007 to Fenwal (Fenwal was subsequently acquired by Fresenius in 2012), at rates that varied by product: 10% of product sales for the platelet system and 3% of product sales for the plasma system. Fresenius assumed Fenwal's rights and obligations under those agreements, including our manufacturing and supply agreement. In this report, references to Fresenius include references to its predecessors-in-interest, Fenwal and Baxter.\nIn November 2013, we amended our manufacturing and supply agreement with Fresenius with the new terms effective January 1, 2014, which we refer to as the 2013 Agreement. Under the 2013 Agreement, Fresenius was obligated to sell, and we were obligated to purchase up to a certain specified annual volume of finished disposable kits for the platelet and plasma systems from Fresenius for both clinical and commercial use. Once the specified annual volume of disposable kits was purchased from Fresenius, we were able to purchase additional quantities of disposable kits from other third-party manufacturers. The amended terms also provided for fixed pricing for finished kits with successive decreasing pricing tiers at various annual production volumes. In addition, the 2013 Agreement required us to purchase additional specified annual volumes of sets if and when an additional Fresenius manufacturing site was identified and qualified to make INTERCEPT disposable kits, subject to mutual agreement on pricing for disposable kits manufactured at the additional site. Fresenius was also obligated to purchase and maintain specified inventory levels of our proprietary inactivation compounds and compound adsorption devices from us at fixed prices.\nIn October 2015, we entered into a ten year Amended and Restated Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, or the 2015 Agreement, with Fresenius, which amended and restated the 2013 Agreement. Under the 2015 Agreement, Fresenius continues to be obligated to sell and we are obligated to purchase finished disposable kits for our platelet, plasma and red blood cell systems. The 2015 Agreement permits us to purchase platelet, plasma and red blood cell systems from third parties to the extent necessary to maintain supply qualifications with such third parties or where local or regional manufacturing is needed to obtain product registrations or sales. Pricing terms are initially fixed and decline at specified annual production levels, and are subject to certain adjustments after the initial pricing term.\nUnder the 2015 Agreement, we are no longer required to make royalty payments to Fenwal for the sale of products after June 30, 2015. Under the 2015 Agreement, we maintain the amounts due from the components sold to Fresenius as a current asset on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets until such time as we purchase finished disposable kits using those components. The 2015 Agreement also requires us to make certain payments totaling \u20ac8.6 million, or the Manufacturing and Development Payments, to Fresenius in 2016 and on December 31 of the earlier of (a) the year of achievement of certain production volumes or (b) 2022. Because these payments represent unconditional payment obligations, we recognize our liability for these payments at their net present value. The Manufacturing and Development Payments liability is accreted through interest expense based on the estimated timing of its ultimate settlement. As of December 31, 2016, we had accrued $4.8 million (\u20ac4.5 million) related to the Manufacturing and Development Payments.\nThe Manufacturing and Development Payments will be made to support certain projects Fresenius will perform on our behalf related to research and development, or R&D activities and manufacturing efficiency activities. We allocated $4.8 million to R&D activities and $2.4 million to manufacturing efficiency activities based on their market value in October 2015. The prepaid asset related to amounts paid up front for the R&D activities to be conducted by Fresenius on our behalf is expensed over the period which such activities occur. The manufacturing efficiency asset is expensed on a straight line basis over the life of the 2015 Agreement.\nThe initial term of the 2015 Agreement extends through July 1, 2025, or the Initial Term, and is automatically renewed thereafter for additional two year terms, or Renewal Terms, subject to termination by either party upon (i) two years written notice prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or (ii) one year written notice prior to the expiration of any Renewal Term. Under the 2015 Agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase certain assets and assume certain liabilities from Fresenius. In the event that Fresenius refuses or is unable to continue operating under the 2015 Agreement, we may be unable to maintain inventory levels or otherwise meet customer demand, and our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.\nLikewise, if we conclude that supply of the INTERCEPT Blood System or components from Fresenius and others is uncertain, we may choose to build and maintain inventories of raw materials, work-in-process components, or finished goods, which would consume capital resources faster than we anticipate and may cause our supply chain to be less efficient. Like most regulated manufacturing processes, our ability to produce our products is dependent on our or Fresenius' ability to source components and raw materials which may at times be in short demand or obsolete. In such cases, we and/or Fresenius may need to source, qualify and obtain approval for replacement materials or components which would likely prove to be disruptive and consume capital resources sooner than we anticipate.\nBARDA\nIn June 2016, we entered into an agreement with BARDA to support our development and implementation of pathogen reduction technology for platelet, plasma, and red blood cells, including access to funding that could potentially support various activities, including funding studies necessary to support a potential PMA submission to the FDA for the red blood cell system, and acceleration of commercial scale up activities to facilitate potential adoption of the red blood cell system by U.S. blood centers.\nThe five-year agreement with BARDA includes a base period, or the Base Period, and options, or Option Periods. The five-year agreement, as amended by BARDA, and Option Periods exercised include committed funding of up to $41.6 million for clinical development of the red blood cell system and subsequent Option Periods that, if exercised by BARDA and completed, would bring the total funding opportunity to $185.0 million over the five-year agreement period. If exercised by BARDA, each subsequent option would fund activities related to broader implementation of the platelet and plasma system or the red blood cell system in areas of Zika virus risk, clinical and regulatory development programs in support of the potential licensure of the red blood cell system in the U.S., and development, manufacturing and scale-up activities for the red blood cell system. We would be responsible for co-investment of up to $15.0 million, if certain options were to be exercised. BARDA will make periodic assessments of our progress and the continuation of the agreement is based on our success in completing the required tasks under the Base Period and each Option Period (if and to the extent any Option Periods are exercised by BARDA). BARDA has rights under certain contract clauses to terminate the agreement, including the ability to terminate for convenience at any time.\nUnder the agreement, we are reimbursed and recognize revenue as qualified direct contract costs are incurred plus allowable indirect costs, based on approved provisional indirect billing rates, which permit recovery of fringe benefits, overhead and general and administrative expenses. Amounts payable under the BARDA agreement are subject to future audits at the discretion of government. These audits could result in an adjustment to revenue previously reported, which adjustments potentially could be significant.\nEquity and Debt Agreements\nCantor\nOn May 5, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement, dated August 31, 2012, as previously amended on March 21, 2014, which together we refer to as the Amended Cantor Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor, that provides for the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock over the term of the Amended Cantor Agreement having an aggregate offering price of up to $132.2 million through Cantor. Under the Amended Cantor Agreement, Cantor acts as our sales agent and receives compensation based on an aggregate of 2% of the gross proceeds on the sale price per share of our common stock. The issuance and sale of these shares by us pursuant to the Amended Cantor Agreement are deemed an at-the-market\u201d offering and are available under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. During the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, 3.5 million and zero shares, respectively, of our common stock were sold under the Amended Cantor Agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $22.0 million and zero, respectively. At December 31, 2016, we had $62.3 million of common stock available to be sold under the Amended Cantor Agreement, subject to the continued effectiveness of our current shelf registration statement or an effective replacement registration statement.\nDebt Agreement\nOn June 30, 2014, we entered into a five year loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance, or the Term Loan Agreement. On June 30, 2014, we received $10.0 million from the first tranche, or Term Loan A. On June 15, 2015, we received $10.0 million from the second tranche, or Term Loan B. On September 29, 2015, the Term Loan Agreement was amended to extend (i) the period in which the third tranche could have been drawn and (ii) the interest-only period for all advances under the Term Loan Agreement. Term Loan A bears an interest rate of 6.95%, and Term Loan B bears an interest rate of 7.01%. Term Loans A and B mature on June 1, 2019. Following the amendment to Term Loan Agreement, we were required to make interest only payments through June 2016 followed by thirty-six months of equal principal and interest payments thereafter. On July 28, 2016, the Term Loan Agreement was again amended to include an additional interest-only period for all advances under the Term Loan Agreement. As amended, we are required to make interest only payments from August 2016 through January 2017, followed by twenty-nine months of equal principal and interest payments thereafter. We are also required to make a final payment equal to 7% of the principal amounts of the Term Loans drawn payable on the earlier to occur of maturity or prepayment. We pledged all current and future assets, excluding our intellectual property and 35% of our investment in our subsidiary, Cerus Europe B.V., as security for borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement. The Term Loan Agreement contains certain nonfinancial covenants, with which we were in compliance at December 31, 2016. For additional discussion on the Term Loan Agreement, see Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements-Debt.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies and Management Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, certain accrued liabilities, valuation and impairment of purchased intangibles and goodwill, valuation of stock options under share-based payments, valuation allowance of our deferred tax assets and uncertain income tax positions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:\n\u2022 Revenue-We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 605-25, Revenue Recognition - Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,\u201d as applicable. Revenue is recognized when (i) persuasive evidence of the agreement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) pricing is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured.\nRevenue related to product sales is generally recognized when we fulfill our obligations for each element of an agreement. For all sales of our INTERCEPT Blood System products, we use a binding purchase order or signed sales contract as evidence of a written agreement. We sell our platelet and plasma systems directly to blood banks, hospitals, universities, government agencies, as well as to distributors in certain regions. Generally, our contracts with our customers do not provide for open return rights, except within a reasonable time after receipt of goods in the case of defective or non-conforming product. For revenue arrangements with multiple elements, we determine whether the delivered elements meet the criteria as separate units of accounting. Such criteria require that the deliverable have stand-alone value to the customer and that if a general right of return exists relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in the control. Once we determine if the deliverable meets the criteria for a separate unit of accounting, we must determine how the consideration should be allocated between the deliverables and how the separate units of accounting should be recognized as revenue. Consideration received is allocated to elements that are identified as discrete units of accounting. Because we have no vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for our systems, the allocation of revenue is based on best estimated selling price for the platelet and plasma systems sold. The objective of best estimated selling price is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale, had the product been sold on a stand-alone basis. We determine best estimated selling price for our platelet and plasma systems by considering multiple factors.\n\u2022 Government contracts revenue - Revenue related to the cost reimbursement provisions under our BARDA agreement is recognized as the allowable direct contract costs plus allowable indirect costs are incurred based on approved provisional indirect billing rates, which permit recovery of fringe benefits, overhead and general and administrative expenses. Direct costs incurred under cost reimbursable contracts are recorded as research and development expenses or general and administrative expenses. Payments to us pursuant to our BARDA agreement are provisional payments subject to adjustment upon audit by the government. These audits could result in an adjustment to revenue previously reported, which adjustments potentially could be significant. Management believes that revenue for periods not yet audited has been recorded in amounts that are expected to be realized upon final audit and settlement. When the final determination of the allowable costs for any year has been made, revenue and billings may be adjusted accordingly in the period that the adjustment is known.\n\u2022 Inventories-We own certain components of INTERCEPT disposable kits in the form of work-in-process inventory and finished goods, UVA illuminators, and certain replacement parts for our illuminators. While it is not customary for our inventory production cycle to exceed twelve months, our supply chain for certain of these components, held as work-in-process on our consolidated balance sheets, could potentially take in excess of one year to complete production before being utilized in finished INTERCEPT disposable kits. We maintain an inventory balance based on our current sales projections, and at each reporting period, we evaluate whether our work-in-process inventory will be consumed in production of finished units in order to sell to existing and prospective customers within the next twelve-month period. We use judgment to factor in lead times for the production of our finished units to meet forecasted demands. If actual results differ from those estimates, work-in-process inventory could potentially accumulate for periods exceeding one year.\nInventory is recorded at the lower of cost, determined on a first in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Our platelet and plasma systems' disposable kits generally have a two-year shelf life from the date of manufacture.\nIlluminators and replacement parts do not have regulated expiration dates. We use significant judgment to analyze and determine if the composition of our inventory is obsolete, slow-moving, or unsalable and frequently review such determinations. We write-down\nspecifically identified unusable, obsolete, slow-moving, or known unsalable inventory that has no alternative use in the period that it is first recognized by using a number of factors including product expiration dates, open and unfulfilled orders, and sales forecasts. Any write-down of our inventory to net realizable value establishes a new cost basis and will be maintained even if certain circumstances suggest that the inventory is recoverable in subsequent periods. Costs associated with the write-down of inventory are recorded in Cost of product revenue\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\u2022 Accrued liabilities-We record accrued liabilities for expenses related to certain contract research activities and development services, including those related to clinical trials, preclinical safety studies and external laboratory studies, as well as development activities being performed by third parties. Some of those accrued liabilities are based on estimates because billings for these activities may not occur on a timely basis consistent with the performance of the services. Specifically, accruals for clinical trials require us to make estimates surrounding costs associated with patients at various stages of the clinical trial, pass through costs to clinical sites, contract research organization costs including fees, database development, and reporting costs, among others.\n\u2022 Goodwill and intangible assets-In August 2010, we acquired certain assets from BioOne. We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations.\u201d In connection with the acquisition, we used significant judgment, including, but not limited to, judgments as to cash flows, discount rates, and economic lives, in identifying the assets acquired and in determining the fair values to record the purchased assets on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, under ASC Topic 805, we were required to assess the fair value of the non-controlling interest that we held in BioOne prior to the acquisition. We determined that a considerable amount of the purchase consideration was goodwill, which represents value unique to us as the holder of worldwide rights to the INTERCEPT Blood System. We may be unable to realize the recorded value of the acquired assets and our assumptions may prove to be incorrect, which may require us to write-down or impair the value of the assets if and when facts and circumstances indicate a need to do so. We perform an impairment test on our goodwill annually on August 31 of each fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, we must then proceed with performing the quantitative two-step process to test goodwill for impairment; otherwise, goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is warranted. We may choose not to perform the qualitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment and proceed directly to the quantitative two-step process; however, we may revert to the qualitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment in any subsequent period. The first step of the two-step process compares the fair value of each reporting unit with the respective carrying amount, including goodwill. We have determined that we operate in one reporting unit and estimate the fair value of our one reporting unit using the enterprise approach under which we consider our quoted market capitalization as reported on the Nasdaq Global Market. We consider quoted market prices that are available in active markets to be the best evidence of fair value. We also consider other factors, which include future forecasted results, the economic environment and overall market conditions. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and, therefore, the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. The second step of the two-step process, which is used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of each reporting unit's goodwill with the respective carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. On August 31, 2016, we performed our annual review of goodwill as described above and determined that goodwill was not impaired during the year ended December 31, 2016. We will continue to monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of our intangible assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, we then measure the amount of the impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. No events or changes in circumstances arose during the year ended December 31, 2016, which would require us to test the recoverability of our intangible assets.\n\u2022 Stock-based compensation-We issue stock-based awards to our employees, contractors and members of our Board of Directors, as strategic, long-term incentives. We also maintain an active employee stock purchase plan within the meaning of Section 423(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. We record stock-based compensation expense for employee awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation.\u201d We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires that we use assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables to determine appropriate inputs to the model, which include the expected term of the grants, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, including forfeitures, our expected stock price volatility, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The grant-date fair value of stock-based awards is then recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period, and is adjusted for estimated forfeitures. To the extent that stock options contain performance criteria for vesting, stock-based compensation is recognized once the performance criteria are probable of being achieved.\nWe apply the provisions of ASC Topic 505-50, Equity Based Payment to Non-Employees\u201d for our stock-based awards issued to non-employees. Under those provisions, the measurement date at which the fair value of the stock-based award is measured is the earlier of\n(i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the grantee to earn the equity instrument is reached or (ii) the date at which the grantee's performance is complete.\n\u2022 Income taxes-Since our inception, we have accumulated significant net operating losses and research and development credits that may be used in future periods to offset future taxable income. We currently estimate that we may not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets. In addition, we may not generate future taxable income prior to the expiration of our net operating loss carry forwards and research and development credits. Timing and significance of any estimated future taxable income is highly subjective and is beyond the control of management due to uncertainties in market conditions, economic environments in which we operate, and timing of regulatory approval of our products. We do not recognize tax positions that do not have a greater than 50% likelihood of being recognized upon review by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Use of a valuation allowance is not an appropriate substitute for the derecognition of a tax position. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax expense. To date, we have not recognized any interest and penalties in our consolidated statements of operations, nor have we accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties. We continue to carry a full valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets. Although we believe it more likely than not that a taxing authority would agree with our current tax positions, there can be no assurance that the tax positions we have taken will be substantiated by a taxing authority if reviewed. Our U.S. federal tax returns from 1998 through 2015 and all our California tax returns through 2015 remain subject to examination by the taxing jurisdictions due to unutilized net operating losses and research credits.\nResults of Operations\nYears Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014\nRevenue\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Government contracts revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct revenue increased by $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, attributable mainly to increased illuminator sales primarily in the U.S market and increased sales volume of disposable platelet and plasma system kits in our European and Middle Eastern markets.\nProduct revenue decreased by $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The primary driver for the decline in reported product revenue was the weakening of the average Euro relative to our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, of approximately 16% during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During the periods presented, most of our product revenue was invoiced and transacted in Euros with reported revenue in U.S. dollars. The decrease in product revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 was partially offset by a higher unit sales volume of our disposable platelet and plasma system kits of 15%.\nWe anticipate product revenue will increase in future periods as the INTERCEPT Blood System gains market acceptance in geographies where commercialization efforts are underway, including anticipated contribution from U.S. sales and newly accessible geographies. However, deterioration in the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar and continued general declines in the economic climate in Russia and the CIS markets would adversely impact product revenue as the majority of our revenues are expected to come from Euro denominated markets and the CIS markets. As a result of these and other factors, the historical results may not be indicative of INTERCEPT Blood System revenue in the future.\nWe recognized $2.1 million revenue from our BARDA agreement during the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of the direct and indirect contract costs incurred in the Base Period and certain Option Periods under the BARDA agreement. We did not recognize any revenue from our BARDA agreement during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nCost of Product Revenue\nOur cost of product revenue consists of the cost of the INTERCEPT Blood System inventory sold; provisions for obsolete, slow-moving and unsaleable product; certain order fulfillment costs, to the extent applicable, costs for idle facilities, and, prior to October 19, 2015, royalties payable to Fenwal for product sales. Inventory is accounted for on a first-in, first-out basis.\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of product revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of product revenue decreased by $3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of the elimination of the royalty to Fenwal in the fourth quarter of 2015 and decreased obsolescence and manufacturing charges in 2016 compared to the prior year.\nCost of product revenue increased by $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily the result of higher unit sales volume and increase of $1.8 million in obsolescence and manufacturing charges, partially offset by inventory produced during periods of more favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Similar to our revenues, during the periods presented, a significant majority of our product was sourced from vendors transacting in Euros and reported by us in U.S. dollars. Per unit cost of product sold declined by 11.4% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014.\nOur realized gross margin on product sales was 45% during the year ended December 31, 2016, up from 31% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in gross margins on product sales was primarily due to the elimination of the royalty to Fenwal in the fourth quarter of 2015, decreased obsolescence and manufacturing charges, increased illuminator sales, and efficiencies realized related to inventory management during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOur gross margin on product sales was 31% during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 42% during the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in gross margins on product sales, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily due to the deterioration in the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar on current period revenues and increased obsolescence and manufacturing charges, partially offset by the impact on cost of revenues which were recorded at more favorable foreign exchange rates in effect at the time the inventory was purchased. In addition, increased period charges for outdated product also resulted in the overall decreases in gross margins during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nChanges in our gross margins are affected by various factors, including the exchange rate of the Euro relative to the U.S dollar, manufacturing and supply chain costs, the mix of product sold, and the mix of customers to which product is sold. Generally, we offer our distributors tiered volume discounts of varying magnitudes, depending on their annual purchases. We may encounter unforeseen manufacturing difficulties which, at a minimum, may lead to higher than anticipated costs, scrap rates, or delays in manufacturing products. In addition, we may face competition which may limit our ability to maintain existing selling prices for our products which in turn would negatively affect our reported gross margins. Our gross margins may be impacted in the future based on all of these criteria.\nWe expect to maintain inventory levels that will be sufficient to meet forecasted demand for a relatively short time period and plan to manufacture at levels above those produced in 2016.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses include salaries and related expenses for our scientific personnel, non-cash stock based compensation, payments to consultants, costs to prepare and conduct preclinical and clinical trials, third-party costs for development activities, certain regulatory costs, costs associated with our facility related infrastructure, and laboratory chemicals and supplies.\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses increased by $5.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to increased costs associated with clinical development of our red blood cell system, our pursuit of PMA supplement approvals for the platelet and plasma systems, and the initial activities under the BARDA agreement.\nResearch and development expenses increased by $3.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increased costs associated with pursuing potential label claim extensions for the platelet system in the U.S., conducting our IDE studies, development of a new generation of our illuminator, and development activities for our red blood cell program.\nWe expect to incur additional research and development costs associated with planning, enrolling and completing our required post-approval studies for the platelet system, pursuing potential regulatory approvals in other geographies where we do not currently sell our platelet and plasma systems, planning and conducting in vitro studies and clinical development of our red blood cell system in Europe and the U.S., completing activities to support a potential CE mark submission for our red blood cell system in Europe, and costs associated with performing the activities under our BARDA agreement. Due to the inherent uncertainties and risks associated with developing biomedical products, including, but not limited to, intense and changing government regulation, uncertainty of future preclinical studies and clinical trial results and uncertainty associated with manufacturing, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the costs to complete these research and development projects. We face numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the successful completion of our research and development projects, which risks and uncertainties are discussed in further detail under Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses include salaries and related expenses for administrative personnel, non-cash stock based compensation, expenses for our commercialization efforts in a number of countries around the world including those in U.S., Europe, the CIS and the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, and expenses for accounting, tax, internal control, legal, facility and infrastructure related expenses, and insurance premiums.\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $2.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to increased spending related to general corporate activities associated with the increased commercial activities targeting and servicing new and potential U.S. customers and the development activities under BARDA agreement.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $8.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increased spending related to activities associated with the U.S. launch of our plasma and platelet products which increased over the course of 2015 and to a lesser extent, increases in back-office support functions.\nWe anticipate our selling, general, and administrative spending to increase over the coming year, as we as we undertake additional activities associated with performing the activities under our BARDA agreement and continue to on-board commercial capabilities in the U.S., including incremental back-office support, sales and marketing personnel, as well as medical science liaisons to educate hospital and physicians on our products and drive hospital demand for INTERCEPT-treated blood components.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets relates to a license to commercialize the INTERCEPT Blood System in certain Asian countries. These intangible assets are being amortized over an estimated useful life of ten years and will be reviewed for impairment.\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmortization of intangible assets remained flat during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, as there were no changes to the composition of our intangible assets or the assumptions used to determine the useful lives. In addition, no impairment charges were recognized related to our intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nWe expect that the amortization of our intangible assets to remain relatively consistent in future periods, unless facts and circumstances arise which may result in our intangible assets being impaired.\nNon-Operating (Expense) Income, Net\nNon-operating (expense) income, net consists of mark-to-market adjustments related to the calculated fair value of our previously-outstanding warrants, foreign exchange gain (loss), interest charges incurred on our debt, and other non-operating gains and losses, including interest earned from our short-term investment portfolio.\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain from revaluation of warrant liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (54\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign exchange gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (396\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,296\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (105\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (69\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,445\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,705\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (599\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,506\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-operating (expense) income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,284\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (184\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (74\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWarrant liability\nIn August 2009 and November 2010, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2.4 million and 3.7 million shares of common stock, respectively, in connection with offerings of our common stock. In August 2014 and November of 2015, all of the outstanding August 2009 and November 2010 warrants, respectively, were exercised. The fair value of the outstanding warrants, which used the Black-Scholes model, was classified as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet and was adjusted at each subsequent reporting period, until such time the warrants were exercised. Upon exercise, the fair value of the warrants was reclassified from liabilities to stockholders' equity. We had no outstanding warrants during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nWe recorded a non-cash gain from the revaluation of the warrant liability of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a non-cash gain of $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This change is primarily due to the change in our underlying stock price as compared to the strike price of the warrants and the exercise of warrants during the current year.\nForeign exchange gain (loss)\nWe recorded a foreign exchange gain of less than $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a foreign exchange loss during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily attributable to favorable foreign currency variations between the Euro and U.S. dollar during the current year compared to unfavorable variations in the prior.\nForeign exchange loss decreased to $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a loss of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily attributable to stabilization of foreign currency variations between the Euro and U.S. dollar, our functional currency, in 2015 as compared to the Euro and U.S. dollar exchange rates in 2014.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased by $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, and increased by $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a higher effective interest rate and larger average outstanding debt balance under our Term Loan Agreement (see discussion under the heading Debt\u201d below), resulting from the drawdown of Term Loan B of $10.0 million in June 2015.\nOther income, net\nOther income, net increased by $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the realized gain from the sale of 50,000 shares of our Aduro common stock, and the increased interest income from our investments in marketable securities.\nOther income, net remained consistent during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,671\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (105\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,983\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a tax expense of $0.2 million, which was a result of our Cerus Europe B.V. subsidiary's operating profit.\nThe tax benefit of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the result of the increased value of our Aduro investment investments. The tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily consisted of foreign taxes of our wholly-owned subsidiary headquartered in Europe.\nWe do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations as we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. Due to our history of cumulative operating losses, management has concluded that, after considering all the available objective evidence, it is not likely that all our net deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, all of our U.S. deferred tax assets continue to be subject to a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn recent years, our sources of capital have primarily consisted of public issuance of common stock, debt instruments, and to a lesser extent, contribution from product sales and proceeds from government contracts.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $22.6 million, compared to $71.0 million at December 31, 2015. Our cash equivalents primarily consist of money market instruments, which are classified for accounting purposes as available-for-sale. In addition, we had $49.1 million of short-term investments and investments in marketable equity securities at December 31, 2016, and $36.9 million at December 31, 2015. We also had total indebtedness under our Term Loan Agreement of approximately $19.4 million at December 31, 2016, and $19.8 million at December 31, 2015. Excess cash is typically invested in highly liquid instruments of short-term investments with high-quality credit rated corporate and government agency fixed-income securities in accordance with our investment policy. At December 31, 2016, our $4.0 million investment in marketable equity securities related solely to our investment in Aduro.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $53.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $51.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily related to the increased cash spent for development activities for our red blood cell program and selling and administrative expenses related to our continuing U.S. commercial launch of our platelet and plasma systems, partially offset by a net increase in the combined total for our accounts payable and accrued liabilities as a result of the timing of payments during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was also impacted by payments to Fresenius related to the Manufacturing and Development Payments, and an increased inventory build during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the corresponding period in 2015.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $51.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $39.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily related to the level of cash spent for development activities for our red blood cell program, support of our expanded use IDE for treatment of platelets, and selling and administrative expenses related to the U.S. commercial launch of our platelet and plasma systems. Also contributing to this increase in net cash used in operating activities were changes in working capital resulting from a decrease in our accounts payable due to the accelerated timing of payments, coupled with an increase in accounts receivable during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the corresponding period in 2014.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.5 million of net cash provided during the year ended December 31, 2015. The change period over period was primarily the result of lower proceeds from maturities of investments in marketable securities during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of 50,000 shares of Aduro common stock.\nNet cash provided in investing activities was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $3.1 million of net cash used during the year ended December 31, 2014. The change was primarily the result of maturities of short term investments in excess of purchases of short term investments, and fewer capital expenditures in 2015.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $24.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $98.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the decrease of proceeds received from public offerings. In January 2015, we issued 14.6 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering for approximately $75.3 million. This was further impacted by our drawdown of Term Loan B of $10.0 million in June 2015 and the proceeds from the exercise of warrants in 2015.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $98.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $36.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the proceeds received from our January 2015 public offering of common stock. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $75.3 million, net of underwriting discounts and other issuance costs. Net cash provided from financing activities was further increased by our drawdown of Term Loan B of $10.0 million in June 2015. This was partially offset by the lack of issuances of our common stock pursuant to the Amended Cantor Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital decreased to $67.2 million at December 31, 2016, from $108.5 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to the cash used to support ongoing operations which resulted in lower cash and cash equivalent balances, and the decline of the market value of our investment in Aduro. Working capital increased to $108.5 million at December 31, 2015, from $45.7 million at December 31, 2014, primarily due to funds received from the January 2015 public offering, our drawdown of Term Loan B of $10.0 million in June 2015, and the valuation of our equity investment in Aduro common stock resulting from Aduro's initial public offering in April 2015, coupled with a decrease in our warrant liability. These increases were partially offset by cash used in operations during 2015.\nCapital Requirements\nOur near-term capital requirements are dependent on various factors, including operating costs and working capital investments associated with commercializing the INTERCEPT Blood System, including in connection with the continuing U.S. commercial launch of our platelet and plasma systems, commitments to fund projects with Fresenius, costs to develop different configurations of existing products and new products, including our illuminator, costs associated with planning, enrolling and completing ongoing studies, and the post-approval studies we are required to conduct in connection with the FDA approval of the platelet system, costs associated with pursuing potential regulatory approvals in other geographies where we do not currently sell our platelet and plasma systems, costs associated with conducting in vitro studies and clinical development of our red blood cell system in Europe and the U.S., including our ongoing European Phase III clinical trial of our red blood cell system for chronic anemia patients, costs associated with performing the agreed-upon activities under our BARDA agreement, and costs related to creating, maintaining and defending our intellectual property. Our long-term capital requirements will also be dependent on the success of our sales efforts, competitive developments, the timing, costs and magnitude of our longer-term clinical trials and other development activities related to our platelet, plasma and red blood cell systems, including required post-approval studies for the platelet system, market preparedness and product launch activities for any of our products in geographies where we do not currently sell our products, and regulatory factors. Until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and generate positive net cash flows from operations, which we may never do, meeting our long-term capital requirements is in large part reliant on continued access to funds under our BARDA agreement and the public and private equity and debt capital markets, as well as on collaborative arrangements with partners, augmented by cash generated from operations and interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances. We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, as well as cash to be received from product sales and under our agreement with BARDA, will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. We have based our cash sufficiency estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect or in excess of amounts than we currently expect, which could adversely affect our commercialization and clinical development activities.\nWe have borrowed and in the future may borrow additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund future growth, including pursuant to our loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance, as described below. We may borrow funds on terms that may include restrictive covenants, including covenants that restrict the operation of our business, liens on assets, high effective interest rates and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets. In addition, we expect to continue to opportunistically seek access to the equity capital markets to support our development efforts and operations. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies, grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, or issue equity that may be substantially dilutive to our stockholders.\nWhile we expect to receive significant funding under our five-year agreement with BARDA, our ability to obtain the funding we expect to receive under the agreement is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including with respect to BARDA's ability to terminate the agreement for convenience at any time. In addition, access to federal contracts is subject to the authorization of funds and approval of our research plans by various organizations within the federal government, including the U.S. Congress. The general economic environment, coupled with tight federal budgets, has led to a general decline in the amount available for government funding. If BARDA were to eliminate, reduce or delay funding under our agreement, this would have a significant negative impact on the programs associated with such funding and could have a significant negative impact on our revenues and cash flows. In addition, if we are unable to reach agreement with the FDA on a license-enabling Phase III clinical trial design for our red blood cell system, our agreement with BARDA will be severely limited in scope or could be terminated altogether, and our ability to complete the development activities required for licensure in the U.S. may require additional capital beyond which we currently have. If alternative sources of funding are not available, we may be forced to suspend or terminate development activities related to the red blood cell system in the U.S.\nAs a result of economic conditions, general global economic uncertainty and other factors, we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will be able to obtain additional capital on reasonable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital due to the volatile global financial markets, general economic uncertainty or other factors, we may need to curtail planned development or commercialization activities. In addition, we may need to obtain additional funds to complete development activities for the red blood cell system necessary for potential regulatory approval in Europe, if costs are higher than anticipated or we encounter delays. We may need to obtain additional funding to conduct additional randomized controlled clinical trials for existing or new products, particularly if we are unable to access any portion of the funding contemplated by our BARDA agreement, and we may choose to defer such activities until we can obtain sufficient additional funding or, at such time, our existing operations provide sufficient cash flow to conduct these trials.\nOther Information\nOn May 5, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement, dated August 31, 2012, as previously amended on March 21, 2014, which together we refer to as the Amended Cantor Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor, that provides for the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock over the term of the Amended Cantor Agreement having an aggregate offering price of up to $132.2 million through Cantor. Under the Amended Cantor Agreement, Cantor acts as our sales agent and receives compensation based on an aggregate of 2% of the gross proceeds on the sale price per share of our common stock. The issuance and sale of these shares by us pursuant to the Amended Cantor Agreement are deemed an at-the-market\u201d offering and are available under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. During the year ended December 31, 2016, 3.5 million shares of our common stock were sold under the Amended Cantor Agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $22.0 million. At December 31, 2016, we had $62.3 million of common stock available to be sold under the Amended Cantor Agreement, subject to the continued effectiveness of our current shelf registration statement or an effective replacement registration statement.\nCommitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nContractual Commitments\nThe following summarizes our contractual commitments at December 31, 2016:\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Minimum purchase requirements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Manufacturing and development obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMinimum purchase requirements\nOur minimum purchase commitments include certain components of our INTERCEPT Blood System which we purchase from third party manufacturers.\nManufacturing and development obligations\nOn October 19, 2015, we entered into the 2015 Agreement with Fresenius. The 2015 Agreement calls for a remaining payment of $5.8 million (\u20ac5.5 million) on December 31 of the year in which certain production volumes are achieved, or December 31, 2022, whichever occurs first. We expect to achieve and the table above assumes that we achieve, the production threshold in 2019.\nOperating leases\nWe generally lease our office facilities and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with initial terms in excess of one year that require us to pay operating costs, property taxes, insurance and maintenance. The operating leases expire at various dates through 2021, with certain of the leases providing for renewal options, provisions for adjusting future lease payments, which is based on the consumer price index and the right to terminate the lease early. Our leased facilities qualify as operating leases under ASC Topic 840, Leases\u201d and as such, are not included on our consolidated balance sheets.\nOther commitments\nOur other commitments primarily consist of obligations for business insurance financing and the landlord financed leasehold improvements, which are in addition to the operating leases we have for office and laboratory space and consulting fees. We pay for the financed leasehold improvements as a component of rent and are required to reimburse our landlords over the remaining life of the respective leases. At December 31, 2016, we had an outstanding liability of $0.5 million related to the remaining payments for the financed business insurance and the $0.4 million related to these leasehold improvements.\nDebt\nOn June 30, 2014, we entered into the Term Loan Agreement with Oxford Finance. On June 30, 2014, we received $10.0 million from Term Loan A. On June 15, 2015, we received $10.0 million from Term Loan B. On September 29, 2015, the Term Loan Agreement was amended to extend the period in which the third tranche could have been drawn and the interest-only period for all advances under the Term Loan Agreement. Term Loan A bears an interest rate of 6.95%, and Term Loan B bears an interest rate of 7.01%. Term Loans A and B mature on June 1, 2019. Following the amendment, we were required to make interest only payments through June 2016 followed by thirty-six months of equal principal and interest payments thereafter. We are also required to make a final payment equal to 7% of the principal amounts of the Term Loans drawn payable on the earlier to occur of maturity or prepayment. The costs associated with the final payment are recognized as interest expense over the principal life of the Term Loans. We may prepay the Term Loans subject to declining prepayment fees over the term of the Term Loan Agreement. The Term Loan Agreement contains certain nonfinancial covenants, with which we were in compliance at December 31, 2016. We pledged all current and future assets, excluding our intellectual property and 35% of our investment in our subsidiary, Cerus Europe B.V., as security for borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement. All principal and interest payments related to Term Loan have been included in the table above.\nOn July 28, 2016, the Term Loan Agreement was amended to include an additional interest-only period for all advances under the Term Loan Agreement. As amended, we are required to make interest only payments from August 2016 through January 2017 followed by twenty-nine months of equal principal and interest payments thereafter.\nFinancial Instruments\nOur investment policy is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio to assist us in funding our operations. We currently invest our cash and cash equivalents in money market funds and interest-bearing accounts with financial institutions. Our money market funds are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, in which quoted prices are available in active markets, as the maturity of money market funds are relatively short and the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Our marketable equity securities consist of our investment in Aduro and are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, as quoted price in active markets is readily available. Our available-for-sale securities related to corporate debt and U.S. government agency securities are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, which uses observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. We maintain portfolio liquidity by ensuring that the securities have active secondary or resale markets. We did not record any other-than-temporary impairment losses during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Adverse global economic conditions have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on the market values of potential investments.\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods.\nOverview\nSince our inception in 1991, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to the research, development, clinical testing and commercialization of the INTERCEPT Blood System. The INTERCEPT Blood System is designed for three blood components: platelets, plasma and red blood cells. The INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets, or platelet system, and the INTERCEPT Blood System for plasma, or plasma system, have received CE marks and FDA approval and are being marketed and sold in a number of countries around the world.\nThe platelet system is approved in the U.S. for ex vivo preparation of pathogen-reduced apheresis platelet components in order to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infection, or TTI, including sepsis, and to potentially reduce the risk of transfusion-associated graft versus host disease or TA-GVHD. The plasma system is approved in the U.S. for ex vivo preparation of plasma in order to reduce the risk of TTI when treating patients requiring therapeutic plasma transfusion.\nThe INTERCEPT Blood System for red blood cells, or the red blood cell system, is currently in development and has not been commercialized anywhere in the world. We completed our European Phase III clinical trial of our red blood cell system for acute anemia patients and have another ongoing European Phase III clinical trial of our red blood cell system for chronic anemia patients. Although we plan to complete additional development activities to support an anticipated CE mark submission for the red blood cell system, such development activities, including any additional studies that may be required by the FDA prior to its review of any proposed U.S. Phase III clinical trial protocol, could prolong development of our red blood cell system, and we do not expect to receive any regulatory approvals of our red blood cell system in the next twelve months, if ever. We understand that while the acute anemia Phase III clinical trial in Europe may be sufficient to receive CE mark approval in Europe, we may need to generate additional safety data from commercial use and/or achieve a successful outcome in the ongoing chronic anemia Phase III clinical trial of our red blood cell system in order to achieve broad market acceptance. In addition, these trials may need to be supplemented by additional, successful Phase III clinical trials for approval in certain countries. If such additional Phase III clinical trials are required, they would likely need to demonstrate equivalency of INTERCEPT-treated red blood cells compared to conventional red blood cells and significantly lower lifespan for INTERCEPT-treated red blood cells compared to non-treated red blood cells may limit our ability to obtain any regulatory approvals for the red blood cell system. As part of our development activities, we will need to successfully complete a number of in vitro studies prior to receiving any regulatory approvals in Europe and we will need to successfully complete additional activities, including a license-enabling Phase III clinical trial in the U.S., prior to receiving any regulatory approvals in the U.S. Successful completion of these activities may require capital beyond that which we currently have or that may be available to us under our agreement with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, and we may be required to obtain additional capital in order to complete the development of and obtain any regulatory approvals for the red blood cell system. If we experience delays in testing, conducting trials or obtaining approvals, our product development costs will increase.\nIn 2016, we entered into a five-year agreement with BARDA, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, to receive funding of up to $41.6 million with a total funding opportunity of up to $185.0 million to support the development of our red blood cell system, including clinical and regulatory development programs in support of potential licensure, and development, manufacturing and scale-up activities, as well as activities related to broader implementation of all three INTERCEPT systems in areas of Zika virus risk. Under the contract, BARDA reimburses us as allowable direct contract costs are incurred plus allowable indirect costs. See BARDA\u201d below for more information.\nOur near-term capital requirements are dependent on various factors, including operating costs and working capital investments associated with commercializing the INTERCEPT Blood System, including in connection with the continuing U.S. commercial launch of our platelet and plasma systems, commitments to fund projects with Fresenius, costs to develop different configurations of existing products and new products, including our illuminator, costs associated with planning, enrolling and completing ongoing studies, and the post-approval studies we are required to conduct in connection with the FDA approval of the platelet system, costs associated with pursuing potential regulatory approvals in other geographies where we do not currently sell our platelet and plasma systems, costs associated with conducting in vitro studies and clinical development of our red blood cell system in Europe and the U.S., including our ongoing European Phase III clinical trial of our red blood cell system for chronic anemia patients, costs associated with performing the agreed-upon activities under our BARDA agreement, and costs related to creating, maintaining and defending our intellectual property. Our long-term capital requirements will also be dependent on the success of our sales efforts, competitive developments, the timing, costs and magnitude of our longer-term clinical trials and other development activities related to our platelet, plasma and red blood cell systems, including required post-approval studies for the platelet system, market preparedness and product launch activities\nfor any of our products in geographies where we do not currently sell our products, and regulatory factors. Until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and generate positive net cash flows from operations, which we may never do, meeting our long-term capital requirements is in large part reliant on continued access to funds under our BARDA agreement and the public and private equity and debt capital markets, as well as on collaborative arrangements with partners, augmented by cash generated from operations and interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances. We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, as well as cash received from product sales and under our agreement with BARDA, will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. We have based our cash sufficiency estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect or in excess of amounts than we currently expect, which could adversely affect our commercialization and clinical development activities.\nWe have borrowed and in the future may borrow additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund future growth, including pursuant to our loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance, as described below, or potentially pursuant to new arrangements with different lenders. We may borrow funds on terms that may include restrictive covenants, including covenants that restrict the operation of our business, liens on assets, high effective interest rates and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets. In addition, we may continue to pursue access to the equity capital markets to support our development efforts and operations. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies, grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, or issue equity that may be substantially dilutive to our stockholders.\nAs a result of economic conditions, general global economic uncertainty and other factors, we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will be able to obtain additional capital on reasonable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital due to the volatile global financial markets, general economic uncertainty or other factors, we may need to curtail planned development or commercialization activities. In addition, we may need to obtain additional funds to complete development activities for the red blood cell system necessary for potential regulatory approval in Europe, if costs are higher than anticipated or we encounter delays. We may need to obtain additional funding to conduct additional randomized controlled clinical trials for existing or new products, particularly if we are unable to access any portion of the funding contemplated by our BARDA agreement, and we may choose to defer such activities until we can obtain sufficient additional funding or, at such time, our existing operations provide sufficient cash flow to conduct these trials.\nAlthough we received FDA approval of our platelet and plasma systems in December 2014, our commercial efforts will be largely focused on implementing INTERCEPT to customers with whom we have previously signed agreements and developing awareness of INTERCEPT's product profile relative to other platelet and plasma products, including conventional, un-treated components. Significant product revenue from customers in the U.S. may not occur, if at all, until we have been able to successfully implement the platelet and plasma systems and demonstrate that they are economical, safe and efficacious for potential customers. We recognize product revenues from the sale of our platelet and plasma systems in a number of countries around the world including those in Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, or CIS, and the Middle East. If we are unable to gain widespread commercial adoption in markets where our blood safety products are approved for commercialization, including the U.S., we will have difficulties achieving profitability. In order to commercialize all of our products and product candidates, we will be required to conduct significant research, development, preclinical and clinical evaluation, commercialization and regulatory compliance activities for our products and product candidates, which, together with anticipated selling, general and administrative expenses, are expected to result in substantial losses. Accordingly, we may never achieve a profitable level of operations in the future.\nIn addition to the product revenues from sales of our platelet and plasma systems, we anticipate that we will continue to recognize revenue from our BARDA agreement. We recognize revenue associated with the BARDA agreement as qualified costs are incurred for reimbursement over the performance period.\nAduro Biotech\nWe hold an investment in Aduro Biotech Inc., or Aduro, common stock totaling 346,700 shares. Aduro trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol ADRO\u201d. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of Aduro's common stock was $11.40 per share. We account for the investment in Aduro as an available-for-sale security on our consolidated balance sheet and adjust the carrying value of this investment to fair value each quarterly reporting period with changes in fair value recorded within other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Prior to Aduro's initial public offering in April 2015, we held the investment in Aduro at zero on our consolidated balance sheet.\nFresenius\nThrough June 30, 2015, we paid royalties to Fenwal Inc., or Fenwal, a subsidiary of Fresenius Kabi AG, or Fresenius, on INTERCEPT Blood System product sales under certain agreements that arose from the sale of the transfusion therapies division of Baxter International Inc., or Baxter, in 2007 to Fenwal (Fenwal was subsequently acquired by Fresenius in 2012), at rates that varied by product: 10% of product sales for the platelet system and 3% of product sales for the plasma system. Fresenius assumed Fenwal's rights and obligations under those agreements, including our manufacturing and supply agreement. In this report, references to Fresenius include references to its predecessors-in-interest, Fenwal and Baxter.\nIn November 2013, we amended our manufacturing and supply agreement with Fresenius with the new terms effective January 1, 2014, which we refer to as the 2013 Agreement. Under the 2013 Agreement, Fresenius was obligated to sell, and we were obligated to purchase up to a certain specified annual volume of finished disposable kits for the platelet and plasma systems from Fresenius for both clinical and commercial use. Once the specified annual volume of disposable kits was purchased from Fresenius, we were able to purchase additional quantities of disposable kits from other third-party manufacturers. The amended terms also provided for fixed pricing for finished kits with successive decreasing pricing tiers at various annual production volumes. In addition, the 2013 Agreement required us to purchase additional specified annual volumes of sets if and when an additional Fresenius manufacturing site was identified and qualified to make INTERCEPT disposable kits, subject to mutual agreement on pricing for disposable kits manufactured at the additional site. Fresenius was also obligated to purchase and maintain specified inventory levels of our proprietary inactivation compounds and compound adsorption devices from us at fixed prices.\nIn October 2015, we entered into a ten year Amended and Restated Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, or the 2015 Agreement, with Fresenius, which amended and restated the 2013 Agreement. Under the 2015 Agreement, Fresenius continues to be obligated to sell and we are obligated to purchase finished disposable kits for our platelet, plasma and red blood cell systems. The 2015 Agreement permits us to purchase platelet, plasma and red blood cell systems from third parties to the extent necessary to maintain supply qualifications with such third parties or where local or regional manufacturing is needed to obtain product registrations or sales. Pricing terms are initially fixed and decline at specified annual production levels, and are subject to certain adjustments after the initial pricing term.\nUnder the 2015 Agreement, we are no longer required to make royalty payments to Fenwal for the sale of products after June 30, 2015. Under the 2015 Agreement, we maintain the amounts due from the components sold to Fresenius as a current asset on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets until such time as we purchase finished disposable kits using those components. The 2015 Agreement also requires us to make certain payments totaling \u20ac8.6 million, or the Manufacturing and Development Payments, to Fresenius in 2016 and on December 31 of the earlier of (a) the year of achievement of certain production volumes or (b) 2022. Because these payments represent unconditional payment obligations, we recognize our liability for these payments at their net present value. The Manufacturing and Development Payments liability is accreted through interest expense based on the estimated timing of its ultimate settlement. As of December 31, 2016, we had accrued $4.8 million (\u20ac4.5 million) related to the Manufacturing and Development Payments.\nThe Manufacturing and Development Payments will be made to support certain projects Fresenius will perform on our behalf related to research and development, or R&D activities and manufacturing efficiency activities. We allocated $4.8 million to R&D activities and $2.4 million to manufacturing efficiency activities based on their market value in October 2015. The prepaid asset related to amounts paid up front for the R&D activities to be conducted by Fresenius on our behalf is expensed over the period which such activities occur. The manufacturing efficiency asset is expensed on a straight line basis over the life of the 2015 Agreement.\nThe initial term of the 2015 Agreement extends through July 1, 2025, or the Initial Term, and is automatically renewed thereafter for additional two year terms, or Renewal Terms, subject to termination by either party upon (i) two years written notice prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or (ii) one year written notice prior to the expiration of any Renewal Term. Under the 2015 Agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase certain assets and assume certain liabilities from Fresenius. In the event that Fresenius refuses or is unable to continue operating under the 2015 Agreement, we may be unable to maintain inventory levels or otherwise meet customer demand, and our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.\nLikewise, if we conclude that supply of the INTERCEPT Blood System or components from Fresenius and others is uncertain, we may choose to build and maintain inventories of raw materials, work-in-process components, or finished goods, which would consume capital resources faster than we anticipate and may cause our supply chain to be less efficient. Like most regulated manufacturing processes, our ability to produce our products is dependent on our or Fresenius' ability to source components and raw materials which may at times be in short demand or obsolete. In such cases, we and/or Fresenius may need to source, qualify and obtain approval for replacement materials or components which would likely prove to be disruptive and consume capital resources sooner than we anticipate.\nBARDA\nIn June 2016, we entered into an agreement with BARDA to support our development and implementation of pathogen reduction technology for platelet, plasma, and red blood cells, including access to funding that could potentially support various activities, including funding studies necessary to support a potential PMA submission to the FDA for the red blood cell system, and acceleration of commercial scale up activities to facilitate potential adoption of the red blood cell system by U.S. blood centers.\nThe five-year agreement with BARDA includes a base period, or the Base Period, and options, or Option Periods. The five-year agreement, as amended by BARDA, and Option Periods exercised include committed funding of up to $41.6 million for clinical development of the red blood cell system and subsequent Option Periods that, if exercised by BARDA and completed, would bring the total funding opportunity to $185.0 million over the five-year agreement period. If exercised by BARDA, each subsequent option would fund activities related to broader implementation of the platelet and plasma system or the red blood cell system in areas of Zika virus risk, clinical and regulatory development programs in support of the potential licensure of the red blood cell system in the U.S., and development, manufacturing and scale-up activities for the red blood cell system. We would be responsible for co-investment of up to $15.0 million, if certain options were to be exercised. BARDA will make periodic assessments of our progress and the continuation of the agreement is based on our success in completing the required tasks under the Base Period and each Option Period (if and to the extent any Option Periods are exercised by BARDA). BARDA has rights under certain contract clauses to terminate the agreement, including the ability to terminate for convenience at any time.\nUnder the agreement, we are reimbursed and recognize revenue as qualified direct contract costs are incurred plus allowable indirect costs, based on approved provisional indirect billing rates, which permit recovery of fringe benefits, overhead and general and administrative expenses. Amounts payable under the BARDA agreement are subject to future audits at the discretion of government. These audits could result in an adjustment to revenue previously reported, which adjustments potentially could be significant.\nEquity and Debt Agreements\nCantor\nOn May 5, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement, dated August 31, 2012, as previously amended on March 21, 2014, which together we refer to as the Amended Cantor Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor, that provides for the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock over the term of the Amended Cantor Agreement having an aggregate offering price of up to $132.2 million through Cantor. Under the Amended Cantor Agreement, Cantor acts as our sales agent and receives compensation based on an aggregate of 2% of the gross proceeds on the sale price per share of our common stock. The issuance and sale of these shares by us pursuant to the Amended Cantor Agreement are deemed an at-the-market\u201d offering and are available under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. During the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, 3.5 million and zero shares, respectively, of our common stock were sold under the Amended Cantor Agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $22.0 million and zero, respectively. At December 31, 2016, we had $62.3 million of common stock available to be sold under the Amended Cantor Agreement, subject to the continued effectiveness of our current shelf registration statement or an effective replacement registration statement.\nDebt Agreement\nOn June 30, 2014, we entered into a five year loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance, or the Term Loan Agreement. On June 30, 2014, we received $10.0 million from the first tranche, or Term Loan A. On June 15, 2015, we received $10.0 million from the second tranche, or Term Loan B. On September 29, 2015, the Term Loan Agreement was amended to extend (i) the period in which the third tranche could have been drawn and (ii) the interest-only period for all advances under the Term Loan Agreement. Term Loan A bears an interest rate of 6.95%, and Term Loan B bears an interest rate of 7.01%. Term Loans A and B mature on June 1, 2019. Following the amendment to Term Loan Agreement, we were required to make interest only payments through June 2016 followed by thirty-six months of equal principal and interest payments thereafter. On July 28, 2016, the Term Loan Agreement was again amended to include an additional interest-only period for all advances under the Term Loan Agreement. As amended, we are required to make interest only payments from August 2016 through January 2017, followed by twenty-nine months of equal principal and interest payments thereafter. We are also required to make a final payment equal to 7% of the principal amounts of the Term Loans drawn payable on the earlier to occur of maturity or prepayment. We pledged all current and future assets, excluding our intellectual property and 35% of our investment in our subsidiary, Cerus Europe B.V., as security for borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement. The Term Loan Agreement contains certain nonfinancial covenants, with which we were in compliance at December 31, 2016. For additional discussion on the Term Loan Agreement, see Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements-Debt.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies and Management Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, certain accrued liabilities, valuation and impairment of purchased intangibles and goodwill, valuation of stock options under share-based payments, valuation allowance of our deferred tax assets and uncertain income tax positions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:\n\u2022 Revenue-We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 605-25, Revenue Recognition - Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,\u201d as applicable. Revenue is recognized when (i) persuasive evidence of the agreement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) pricing is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured.\nRevenue related to product sales is generally recognized when we fulfill our obligations for each element of an agreement. For all sales of our INTERCEPT Blood System products, we use a binding purchase order or signed sales contract as evidence of a written agreement. We sell our platelet and plasma systems directly to blood banks, hospitals, universities, government agencies, as well as to distributors in certain regions. Generally, our contracts with our customers do not provide for open return rights, except within a reasonable time after receipt of goods in the case of defective or non-conforming product. For revenue arrangements with multiple elements, we determine whether the delivered elements meet the criteria as separate units of accounting. Such criteria require that the deliverable have stand-alone value to the customer and that if a general right of return exists relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in the control. Once we determine if the deliverable meets the criteria for a separate unit of accounting, we must determine how the consideration should be allocated between the deliverables and how the separate units of accounting should be recognized as revenue. Consideration received is allocated to elements that are identified as discrete units of accounting. Because we have no vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for our systems, the allocation of revenue is based on best estimated selling price for the platelet and plasma systems sold. The objective of best estimated selling price is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale, had the product been sold on a stand-alone basis. We determine best estimated selling price for our platelet and plasma systems by considering multiple factors.\n\u2022 Government contracts revenue - Revenue related to the cost reimbursement provisions under our BARDA agreement is recognized as the allowable direct contract costs plus allowable indirect costs are incurred based on approved provisional indirect billing rates, which permit recovery of fringe benefits, overhead and general and administrative expenses. Direct costs incurred under cost reimbursable contracts are recorded as research and development expenses or general and administrative expenses. Payments to us pursuant to our BARDA agreement are provisional payments subject to adjustment upon audit by the government. These audits could result in an adjustment to revenue previously reported, which adjustments potentially could be significant. Management believes that revenue for periods not yet audited has been recorded in amounts that are expected to be realized upon final audit and settlement. When the final determination of the allowable costs for any year has been made, revenue and billings may be adjusted accordingly in the period that the adjustment is known.\n\u2022 Inventories-We own certain components of INTERCEPT disposable kits in the form of work-in-process inventory and finished goods, UVA illuminators, and certain replacement parts for our illuminators. While it is not customary for our inventory production cycle to exceed twelve months, our supply chain for certain of these components, held as work-in-process on our consolidated balance sheets, could potentially take in excess of one year to complete production before being utilized in finished INTERCEPT disposable kits. We maintain an inventory balance based on our current sales projections, and at each reporting period, we evaluate whether our work-in-process inventory will be consumed in production of finished units in order to sell to existing and prospective customers within the next twelve-month period. We use judgment to factor in lead times for the production of our finished units to meet forecasted demands. If actual results differ from those estimates, work-in-process inventory could potentially accumulate for periods exceeding one year.\nInventory is recorded at the lower of cost, determined on a first in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Our platelet and plasma systems' disposable kits generally have a two-year shelf life from the date of manufacture.\nIlluminators and replacement parts do not have regulated expiration dates. We use significant judgment to analyze and determine if the composition of our inventory is obsolete, slow-moving, or unsalable and frequently review such determinations. We write-down\nspecifically identified unusable, obsolete, slow-moving, or known unsalable inventory that has no alternative use in the period that it is first recognized by using a number of factors including product expiration dates, open and unfulfilled orders, and sales forecasts. Any write-down of our inventory to net realizable value establishes a new cost basis and will be maintained even if certain circumstances suggest that the inventory is recoverable in subsequent periods. Costs associated with the write-down of inventory are recorded in Cost of product revenue\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\u2022 Accrued liabilities-We record accrued liabilities for expenses related to certain contract research activities and development services, including those related to clinical trials, preclinical safety studies and external laboratory studies, as well as development activities being performed by third parties. Some of those accrued liabilities are based on estimates because billings for these activities may not occur on a timely basis consistent with the performance of the services. Specifically, accruals for clinical trials require us to make estimates surrounding costs associated with patients at various stages of the clinical trial, pass through costs to clinical sites, contract research organization costs including fees, database development, and reporting costs, among others.\n\u2022 Goodwill and intangible assets-In August 2010, we acquired certain assets from BioOne. We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations.\u201d In connection with the acquisition, we used significant judgment, including, but not limited to, judgments as to cash flows, discount rates, and economic lives, in identifying the assets acquired and in determining the fair values to record the purchased assets on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, under ASC Topic 805, we were required to assess the fair value of the non-controlling interest that we held in BioOne prior to the acquisition. We determined that a considerable amount of the purchase consideration was goodwill, which represents value unique to us as the holder of worldwide rights to the INTERCEPT Blood System. We may be unable to realize the recorded value of the acquired assets and our assumptions may prove to be incorrect, which may require us to write-down or impair the value of the assets if and when facts and circumstances indicate a need to do so. We perform an impairment test on our goodwill annually on August 31 of each fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, we must then proceed with performing the quantitative two-step process to test goodwill for impairment; otherwise, goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is warranted. We may choose not to perform the qualitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment and proceed directly to the quantitative two-step process; however, we may revert to the qualitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment in any subsequent period. The first step of the two-step process compares the fair value of each reporting unit with the respective carrying amount, including goodwill. We have determined that we operate in one reporting unit and estimate the fair value of our one reporting unit using the enterprise approach under which we consider our quoted market capitalization as reported on the Nasdaq Global Market. We consider quoted market prices that are available in active markets to be the best evidence of fair value. We also consider other factors, which include future forecasted results, the economic environment and overall market conditions. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and, therefore, the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. The second step of the two-step process, which is used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of each reporting unit's goodwill with the respective carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. On August 31, 2016, we performed our annual review of goodwill as described above and determined that goodwill was not impaired during the year ended December 31, 2016. We will continue to monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of our intangible assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, we then measure the amount of the impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. No events or changes in circumstances arose during the year ended December 31, 2016, which would require us to test the recoverability of our intangible assets.\n\u2022 Stock-based compensation-We issue stock-based awards to our employees, contractors and members of our Board of Directors, as strategic, long-term incentives. We also maintain an active employee stock purchase plan within the meaning of Section 423(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. We record stock-based compensation expense for employee awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation.\u201d We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires that we use assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables to determine appropriate inputs to the model, which include the expected term of the grants, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, including forfeitures, our expected stock price volatility, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The grant-date fair value of stock-based awards is then recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period, and is adjusted for estimated forfeitures. To the extent that stock options contain performance criteria for vesting, stock-based compensation is recognized once the performance criteria are probable of being achieved.\nWe apply the provisions of ASC Topic 505-50, Equity Based Payment to Non-Employees\u201d for our stock-based awards issued to non-employees. Under those provisions, the measurement date at which the fair value of the stock-based award is measured is the earlier of\n(i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the grantee to earn the equity instrument is reached or (ii) the date at which the grantee's performance is complete.\n\u2022 Income taxes-Since our inception, we have accumulated significant net operating losses and research and development credits that may be used in future periods to offset future taxable income. We currently estimate that we may not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets. In addition, we may not generate future taxable income prior to the expiration of our net operating loss carry forwards and research and development credits. Timing and significance of any estimated future taxable income is highly subjective and is beyond the control of management due to uncertainties in market conditions, economic environments in which we operate, and timing of regulatory approval of our products. We do not recognize tax positions that do not have a greater than 50% likelihood of being recognized upon review by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Use of a valuation allowance is not an appropriate substitute for the derecognition of a tax position. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax expense. To date, we have not recognized any interest and penalties in our consolidated statements of operations, nor have we accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties. We continue to carry a full valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets. Although we believe it more likely than not that a taxing authority would agree with our current tax positions, there can be no assurance that the tax positions we have taken will be substantiated by a taxing authority if reviewed. Our U.S. federal tax returns from 1998 through 2015 and all our California tax returns through 2015 remain subject to examination by the taxing jurisdictions due to unutilized net operating losses and research credits.\nResults of Operations\nYears Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014\nRevenue\n\nProduct revenue increased by $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, attributable mainly to increased illuminator sales primarily in the U.S market and increased sales volume of disposable platelet and plasma system kits in our European and Middle Eastern markets.\nProduct revenue decreased by $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The primary driver for the decline in reported product revenue was the weakening of the average Euro relative to our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, of approximately 16% during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During the periods presented, most of our product revenue was invoiced and transacted in Euros with reported revenue in U.S. dollars. The decrease in product revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 was partially offset by a higher unit sales volume of our disposable platelet and plasma system kits of 15%.\nWe anticipate product revenue will increase in future periods as the INTERCEPT Blood System gains market acceptance in geographies where commercialization efforts are underway, including anticipated contribution from U.S. sales and newly accessible geographies. However, deterioration in the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar and continued general declines in the economic climate in Russia and the CIS markets would adversely impact product revenue as the majority of our revenues are expected to come from Euro denominated markets and the CIS markets. As a result of these and other factors, the historical results may not be indicative of INTERCEPT Blood System revenue in the future.\nWe recognized $2.1 million revenue from our BARDA agreement during the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of the direct and indirect contract costs incurred in the Base Period and certain Option Periods under the BARDA agreement. We did not recognize any revenue from our BARDA agreement during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nCost of Product Revenue\nOur cost of product revenue consists of the cost of the INTERCEPT Blood System inventory sold; provisions for obsolete, slow-moving and unsaleable product; certain order fulfillment costs, to the extent applicable, costs for idle facilities, and, prior to October 19, 2015, royalties payable to Fenwal for product sales. Inventory is accounted for on a first-in, first-out basis.\n\nCost of product revenue decreased by $3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of the elimination of the royalty to Fenwal in the fourth quarter of 2015 and decreased obsolescence and manufacturing charges in 2016 compared to the prior year.\nCost of product revenue increased by $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily the result of higher unit sales volume and increase of $1.8 million in obsolescence and manufacturing charges, partially offset by inventory produced during periods of more favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Similar to our revenues, during the periods presented, a significant majority of our product was sourced from vendors transacting in Euros and reported by us in U.S. dollars. Per unit cost of product sold declined by 11.4% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014.\nOur realized gross margin on product sales was 45% during the year ended December 31, 2016, up from 31% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in gross margins on product sales was primarily due to the elimination of the royalty to Fenwal in the fourth quarter of 2015, decreased obsolescence and manufacturing charges, increased illuminator sales, and efficiencies realized related to inventory management during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOur gross margin on product sales was 31% during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 42% during the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in gross margins on product sales, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily due to the deterioration in the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar on current period revenues and increased obsolescence and manufacturing charges, partially offset by the impact on cost of revenues which were recorded at more favorable foreign exchange rates in effect at the time the inventory was purchased. In addition, increased period charges for outdated product also resulted in the overall decreases in gross margins during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nChanges in our gross margins are affected by various factors, including the exchange rate of the Euro relative to the U.S dollar, manufacturing and supply chain costs, the mix of product sold, and the mix of customers to which product is sold. Generally, we offer our distributors tiered volume discounts of varying magnitudes, depending on their annual purchases. We may encounter unforeseen manufacturing difficulties which, at a minimum, may lead to higher than anticipated costs, scrap rates, or delays in manufacturing products. In addition, we may face competition which may limit our ability to maintain existing selling prices for our products which in turn would negatively affect our reported gross margins. Our gross margins may be impacted in the future based on all of these criteria.\nWe expect to maintain inventory levels that will be sufficient to meet forecasted demand for a relatively short time period and plan to manufacture at levels above those produced in 2016.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses include salaries and related expenses for our scientific personnel, non-cash stock based compensation, payments to consultants, costs to prepare and conduct preclinical and clinical trials, third-party costs for development activities, certain regulatory costs, costs associated with our facility related infrastructure, and laboratory chemicals and supplies.\n\nResearch and development expenses increased by $5.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to increased costs associated with clinical development of our red blood cell system, our pursuit of PMA supplement approvals for the platelet and plasma systems, and the initial activities under the BARDA agreement.\nResearch and development expenses increased by $3.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increased costs associated with pursuing potential label claim extensions for the platelet system in the U.S., conducting our IDE studies, development of a new generation of our illuminator, and development activities for our red blood cell program.\nWe expect to incur additional research and development costs associated with planning, enrolling and completing our required post-approval studies for the platelet system, pursuing potential regulatory approvals in other geographies where we do not currently sell our platelet and plasma systems, planning and conducting in vitro studies and clinical development of our red blood cell system in Europe and the U.S., completing activities to support a potential CE mark submission for our red blood cell system in Europe, and costs associated with performing the activities under our BARDA agreement. Due to the inherent uncertainties and risks associated with developing biomedical products, including, but not limited to, intense and changing government regulation, uncertainty of future preclinical studies and clinical trial results and uncertainty associated with manufacturing, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the costs to complete these research and development projects. We face numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the successful completion of our research and development projects, which risks and uncertainties are discussed in further detail under Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses include salaries and related expenses for administrative personnel, non-cash stock based compensation, expenses for our commercialization efforts in a number of countries around the world including those in U.S., Europe, the CIS and the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, and expenses for accounting, tax, internal control, legal, facility and infrastructure related expenses, and insurance premiums.\n\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $2.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to increased spending related to general corporate activities associated with the increased commercial activities targeting and servicing new and potential U.S. customers and the development activities under BARDA agreement.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $8.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increased spending related to activities associated with the U.S. launch of our plasma and platelet products which increased over the course of 2015 and to a lesser extent, increases in back-office support functions.\nWe anticipate our selling, general, and administrative spending to increase over the coming year, as we as we undertake additional activities associated with performing the activities under our BARDA agreement and continue to on-board commercial capabilities in the U.S., including incremental back-office support, sales and marketing personnel, as well as medical science liaisons to educate hospital and physicians on our products and drive hospital demand for INTERCEPT-treated blood components.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets relates to a license to commercialize the INTERCEPT Blood System in certain Asian countries. These intangible assets are being amortized over an estimated useful life of ten years and will be reviewed for impairment.\n\nAmortization of intangible assets remained flat during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, as there were no changes to the composition of our intangible assets or the assumptions used to determine the useful lives. In addition, no impairment charges were recognized related to our intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nWe expect that the amortization of our intangible assets to remain relatively consistent in future periods, unless facts and circumstances arise which may result in our intangible assets being impaired.\nNon-Operating (Expense) Income, Net\nNon-operating (expense) income, net consists of mark-to-market adjustments related to the calculated fair value of our previously-outstanding warrants, foreign exchange gain (loss), interest charges incurred on our debt, and other non-operating gains and losses, including interest earned from our short-term investment portfolio.\n\nWarrant liability\nIn August 2009 and November 2010, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2.4 million and 3.7 million shares of common stock, respectively, in connection with offerings of our common stock. In August 2014 and November of 2015, all of the outstanding August 2009 and November 2010 warrants, respectively, were exercised. The fair value of the outstanding warrants, which used the Black-Scholes model, was classified as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet and was adjusted at each subsequent reporting period, until such time the warrants were exercised. Upon exercise, the fair value of the warrants was reclassified from liabilities to stockholders' equity. We had no outstanding warrants during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nWe recorded a non-cash gain from the revaluation of the warrant liability of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a non-cash gain of $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This change is primarily due to the change in our underlying stock price as compared to the strike price of the warrants and the exercise of warrants during the current year.\nForeign exchange gain (loss)\nWe recorded a foreign exchange gain of less than $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a foreign exchange loss during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily attributable to favorable foreign currency variations between the Euro and U.S. dollar during the current year compared to unfavorable variations in the prior.\nForeign exchange loss decreased to $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a loss of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily attributable to stabilization of foreign currency variations between the Euro and U.S. dollar, our functional currency, in 2015 as compared to the Euro and U.S. dollar exchange rates in 2014.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased by $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, and increased by $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a higher effective interest rate and larger average outstanding debt balance under our Term Loan Agreement (see discussion under the heading Debt\u201d below), resulting from the drawdown of Term Loan B of $10.0 million in June 2015.\nOther income, net\nOther income, net increased by $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the realized gain from the sale of 50,000 shares of our Aduro common stock, and the increased interest income from our investments in marketable securities.\nOther income, net remained consistent during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a tax expense of $0.2 million, which was a result of our Cerus Europe B.V. subsidiary's operating profit.\nThe tax benefit of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the result of the increased value of our Aduro investment investments. The tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily consisted of foreign taxes of our wholly-owned subsidiary headquartered in Europe.\nWe do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations as we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. Due to our history of cumulative operating losses, management has concluded that, after considering all the available objective evidence, it is not likely that all our net deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, all of our U.S. deferred tax assets continue to be subject to a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn recent years, our sources of capital have primarily consisted of public issuance of common stock, debt instruments, and to a lesser extent, contribution from product sales and proceeds from government contracts.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $22.6 million, compared to $71.0 million at December 31, 2015. Our cash equivalents primarily consist of money market instruments, which are classified for accounting purposes as available-for-sale. In addition, we had $49.1 million of short-term investments and investments in marketable equity securities at December 31, 2016, and $36.9 million at December 31, 2015. We also had total indebtedness under our Term Loan Agreement of approximately $19.4 million at December 31, 2016, and $19.8 million at December 31, 2015. Excess cash is typically invested in highly liquid instruments of short-term investments with high-quality credit rated corporate and government agency fixed-income securities in accordance with our investment policy. At December 31, 2016, our $4.0 million investment in marketable equity securities related solely to our investment in Aduro.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $53.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $51.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily related to the increased cash spent for development activities for our red blood cell program and selling and administrative expenses related to our continuing U.S. commercial launch of our platelet and plasma systems, partially offset by a net increase in the combined total for our accounts payable and accrued liabilities as a result of the timing of payments during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was also impacted by payments to Fresenius related to the Manufacturing and Development Payments, and an increased inventory build during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the corresponding period in 2015.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $51.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $39.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily related to the level of cash spent for development activities for our red blood cell program, support of our expanded use IDE for treatment of platelets, and selling and administrative expenses related to the U.S. commercial launch of our platelet and plasma systems. Also contributing to this increase in net cash used in operating activities were changes in working capital resulting from a decrease in our accounts payable due to the accelerated timing of payments, coupled with an increase in accounts receivable during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the corresponding period in 2014.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.5 million of net cash provided during the year ended December 31, 2015. The change period over period was primarily the result of lower proceeds from maturities of investments in marketable securities during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of 50,000 shares of Aduro common stock.\nNet cash provided in investing activities was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $3.1 million of net cash used during the year ended December 31, 2014. The change was primarily the result of maturities of short term investments in excess of purchases of short term investments, and fewer capital expenditures in 2015.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $24.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $98.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the decrease of proceeds received from public offerings. In January 2015, we issued 14.6 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering for approximately $75.3 million. This was further impacted by our drawdown of Term Loan B of $10.0 million in June 2015 and the proceeds from the exercise of warrants in 2015.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $98.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $36.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the proceeds received from our January 2015 public offering of common stock. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $75.3 million, net of underwriting discounts and other issuance costs. Net cash provided from financing activities was further increased by our drawdown of Term Loan B of $10.0 million in June 2015. This was partially offset by the lack of issuances of our common stock pursuant to the Amended Cantor Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital decreased to $67.2 million at December 31, 2016, from $108.5 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to the cash used to support ongoing operations which resulted in lower cash and cash equivalent balances, and the decline of the market value of our investment in Aduro. Working capital increased to $108.5 million at December 31, 2015, from $45.7 million at December 31, 2014, primarily due to funds received from the January 2015 public offering, our drawdown of Term Loan B of $10.0 million in June 2015, and the valuation of our equity investment in Aduro common stock resulting from Aduro's initial public offering in April 2015, coupled with a decrease in our warrant liability. These increases were partially offset by cash used in operations during 2015.\nCapital Requirements\nOur near-term capital requirements are dependent on various factors, including operating costs and working capital investments associated with commercializing the INTERCEPT Blood System, including in connection with the continuing U.S. commercial launch of our platelet and plasma systems, commitments to fund projects with Fresenius, costs to develop different configurations of existing products and new products, including our illuminator, costs associated with planning, enrolling and completing ongoing studies, and the post-approval studies we are required to conduct in connection with the FDA approval of the platelet system, costs associated with pursuing potential regulatory approvals in other geographies where we do not currently sell our platelet and plasma systems, costs associated with conducting in vitro studies and clinical development of our red blood cell system in Europe and the U.S., including our ongoing European Phase III clinical trial of our red blood cell system for chronic anemia patients, costs associated with performing the agreed-upon activities under our BARDA agreement, and costs related to creating, maintaining and defending our intellectual property. Our long-term capital requirements will also be dependent on the success of our sales efforts, competitive developments, the timing, costs and magnitude of our longer-term clinical trials and other development activities related to our platelet, plasma and red blood cell systems, including required post-approval studies for the platelet system, market preparedness and product launch activities for any of our products in geographies where we do not currently sell our products, and regulatory factors. Until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and generate positive net cash flows from operations, which we may never do, meeting our long-term capital requirements is in large part reliant on continued access to funds under our BARDA agreement and the public and private equity and debt capital markets, as well as on collaborative arrangements with partners, augmented by cash generated from operations and interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances. We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, as well as cash to be received from product sales and under our agreement with BARDA, will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. We have based our cash sufficiency estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect or in excess of amounts than we currently expect, which could adversely affect our commercialization and clinical development activities.\nWe have borrowed and in the future may borrow additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund future growth, including pursuant to our loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance, as described below. We may borrow funds on terms that may include restrictive covenants, including covenants that restrict the operation of our business, liens on assets, high effective interest rates and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets. In addition, we expect to continue to opportunistically seek access to the equity capital markets to support our development efforts and operations. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies, grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, or issue equity that may be substantially dilutive to our stockholders.\nWhile we expect to receive significant funding under our five-year agreement with BARDA, our ability to obtain the funding we expect to receive under the agreement is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including with respect to BARDA's ability to terminate the agreement for convenience at any time. In addition, access to federal contracts is subject to the authorization of funds and approval of our research plans by various organizations within the federal government, including the U.S. Congress. The general economic environment, coupled with tight federal budgets, has led to a general decline in the amount available for government funding. If BARDA were to eliminate, reduce or delay funding under our agreement, this would have a significant negative impact on the programs associated with such funding and could have a significant negative impact on our revenues and cash flows. In addition, if we are unable to reach agreement with the FDA on a license-enabling Phase III clinical trial design for our red blood cell system, our agreement with BARDA will be severely limited in scope or could be terminated altogether, and our ability to complete the development activities required for licensure in the U.S. may require additional capital beyond which we currently have. If alternative sources of funding are not available, we may be forced to suspend or terminate development activities related to the red blood cell system in the U.S.\nAs a result of economic conditions, general global economic uncertainty and other factors, we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will be able to obtain additional capital on reasonable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital due to the volatile global financial markets, general economic uncertainty or other factors, we may need to curtail planned development or commercialization activities. In addition, we may need to obtain additional funds to complete development activities for the red blood cell system necessary for potential regulatory approval in Europe, if costs are higher than anticipated or we encounter delays. We may need to obtain additional funding to conduct additional randomized controlled clinical trials for existing or new products, particularly if we are unable to access any portion of the funding contemplated by our BARDA agreement, and we may choose to defer such activities until we can obtain sufficient additional funding or, at such time, our existing operations provide sufficient cash flow to conduct these trials.\nOther Information\nOn May 5, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement, dated August 31, 2012, as previously amended on March 21, 2014, which together we refer to as the Amended Cantor Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor, that provides for the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock over the term of the Amended Cantor Agreement having an aggregate offering price of up to $132.2 million through Cantor. Under the Amended Cantor Agreement, Cantor acts as our sales agent and receives compensation based on an aggregate of 2% of the gross proceeds on the sale price per share of our common stock. The issuance and sale of these shares by us pursuant to the Amended Cantor Agreement are deemed an at-the-market\u201d offering and are available under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. During the year ended December 31, 2016, 3.5 million shares of our common stock were sold under the Amended Cantor Agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $22.0 million. At December 31, 2016, we had $62.3 million of common stock available to be sold under the Amended Cantor Agreement, subject to the continued effectiveness of our current shelf registration statement or an effective replacement registration statement.\nCommitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nContractual Commitments\nThe following summarizes our contractual commitments at December 31, 2016:\n\nMinimum purchase requirements\nOur minimum purchase commitments include certain components of our INTERCEPT Blood System which we purchase from third party manufacturers.\nManufacturing and development obligations\nOn October 19, 2015, we entered into the 2015 Agreement with Fresenius. The 2015 Agreement calls for a remaining payment of $5.8 million (\u20ac5.5 million) on December 31 of the year in which certain production volumes are achieved, or December 31, 2022, whichever occurs first. We expect to achieve and the table above assumes that we achieve, the production threshold in 2019.\nOperating leases\nWe generally lease our office facilities and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with initial terms in excess of one year that require us to pay operating costs, property taxes, insurance and maintenance. The operating leases expire at various dates through 2021, with certain of the leases providing for renewal options, provisions for adjusting future lease payments, which is based on the consumer price index and the right to terminate the lease early. Our leased facilities qualify as operating leases under ASC Topic 840, Leases\u201d and as such, are not included on our consolidated balance sheets.\nOther commitments\nOur other commitments primarily consist of obligations for business insurance financing and the landlord financed leasehold improvements, which are in addition to the operating leases we have for office and laboratory space and consulting fees. We pay for the financed leasehold improvements as a component of rent and are required to reimburse our landlords over the remaining life of the respective leases. At December 31, 2016, we had an outstanding liability of $0.5 million related to the remaining payments for the financed business insurance and the $0.4 million related to these leasehold improvements.\nDebt\nOn June 30, 2014, we entered into the Term Loan Agreement with Oxford Finance. On June 30, 2014, we received $10.0 million from Term Loan A. On June 15, 2015, we received $10.0 million from Term Loan B. On September 29, 2015, the Term Loan Agreement was amended to extend the period in which the third tranche could have been drawn and the interest-only period for all advances under the Term Loan Agreement. Term Loan A bears an interest rate of 6.95%, and Term Loan B bears an interest rate of 7.01%. Term Loans A and B mature on June 1, 2019. Following the amendment, we were required to make interest only payments through June 2016 followed by thirty-six months of equal principal and interest payments thereafter. We are also required to make a final payment equal to 7% of the principal amounts of the Term Loans drawn payable on the earlier to occur of maturity or prepayment. The costs associated with the final payment are recognized as interest expense over the principal life of the Term Loans. We may prepay the Term Loans subject to declining prepayment fees over the term of the Term Loan Agreement. The Term Loan Agreement contains certain nonfinancial covenants, with which we were in compliance at December 31, 2016. We pledged all current and future assets, excluding our intellectual property and 35% of our investment in our subsidiary, Cerus Europe B.V., as security for borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement. All principal and interest payments related to Term Loan have been included in the table above.\nOn July 28, 2016, the Term Loan Agreement was amended to include an additional interest-only period for all advances under the Term Loan Agreement. As amended, we are required to make interest only payments from August 2016 through January 2017 followed by twenty-nine months of equal principal and interest payments thereafter.\nFinancial Instruments\nOur investment policy is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio to assist us in funding our operations. We currently invest our cash and cash equivalents in money market funds and interest-bearing accounts with financial institutions. Our money market funds are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, in which quoted prices are available in active markets, as the maturity of money market funds are relatively short and the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Our marketable equity securities consist of our investment in Aduro and are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, as quoted price in active markets is readily available. Our available-for-sale securities related to corporate debt and U.S. government agency securities are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, which uses observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. We maintain portfolio liquidity by ensuring that the securities have active secondary or resale markets. We did not record any other-than-temporary impairment losses during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Adverse global economic conditions have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on the market values of potential investments.\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_tables": "Table 126:

"summary": " Here is a summary of the key points from the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- Cerus develops blood safety technologies, including the INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets, plasma, and red blood cells. The platelet and plasma systems are approved and being marketed in several countries, while the red blood cell system is still in development.\n\n- Revenue is generated from product sales and a contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). Revenue increased from $34.2 million in 2015 to $39.3 million in 2016, mainly due to higher illuminator sales and disposable kit volumes.\n\nExpenses \n- Operating expenses increased in 2016 compared to 2015, driven by increased R&D spending on the red blood cell system and clinical trials, as well as higher SG&A costs related to the commercialization of the platelet and plasma systems in the U.S.\n\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\n- Cash used in operations was $53.5 million in 2016 compared to $51.1 million in 2015, primarily due to higher R&D and SG&A spending. \n\n- Cash from financing in 2016 was $24.6 million compared to $98.0 million in 2015. The decrease was mainly due to lower proceeds from public offerings.\n\n- Cerus expects its existing cash, cash from product sales, and funding from the BARDA agreement to meet capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. Additional funding may be needed to complete development of the red blood cell system.\n\nKey Contractual Obligations\n- Purchase commitments of $9.5 million through 2022 for INTERCEPT Blood System components.\n\n- $5.8 million remaining manufacturing and development obligation payment to Fresenius.\n\n- $22.8 million of debt maturities through June 2019.\n\nIn summary, Cerus is commercializing its platelet and plasma systems while continuing R&D and clinical trials for its red blood cell system, with funding from product sales, public equity/debt offerings, and government agreements."}
