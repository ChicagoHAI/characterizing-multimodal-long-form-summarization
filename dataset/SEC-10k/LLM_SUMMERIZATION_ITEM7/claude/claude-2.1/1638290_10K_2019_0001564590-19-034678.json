MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read together with the sections entitled Risk Factors,\u201d Selected Financial Data,\u201d and the financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this discussion and analysis regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding the performance of our business, anticipated financial results, liquidity and the other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the successful integration of NauticStar and Crest into our business and the risks and uncertainties described in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and in Risk Factors\u201d above. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nFiscal 2019 was a record year, with net sales of $466.4 million, an increase of 40.2% from fiscal 2018, primarily due to strong boat sales from our MasterCraft brand, the October 2018 acquisition of Crest, and the inclusion of NauticStar in our fiscal 2019 first quarter results.\nFull year net income of $21.4 million was a decrease of 46.2% from fiscal 2018, with diluted earnings per share decreasing 46.2% to $1.14 per share. The significant decrease was driven by the negative impact of a $31.0 million non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment at NauticStar principally as a result of a decline, in the fiscal fourth quarter, in the outlook for sales and operating performance relative to our acquisition plan. For more information regarding this impairment charge, see Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. NauticStar's core industry category, the value-brand saltwater fishing boat segment, has experienced a recent slowing in demand, especially for boats less than 24 feet in length, which represent a material percentage of NauticStar's current model mix. The decrease in net income and diluted earnings per share were offset by the Crest acquisition, which added $76.6 million in net sales, and continued strong operating results at MasterCraft.\nRecent Transactions\nAcquisition of Crest Marine, LLC\nOn October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Crest. The purchase price was $81.7 million, including customary adjustments for the amount of working capital in the acquired business at the closing date. A portion of the purchase price was deposited into an escrow account in order to secure certain post-closing obligations of the former members of Crest. The Company's results of operations presented herein include Crest's results from October 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019.\nFourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\nOn October 1, 2018, we entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement with a syndicate of certain financial institutions (the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement\u201d). The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement replaced the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated October 2, 2017. The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement provides us with a $190 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $75 million term loan and an $80 million term loan (together, the Term Loans\u201d) and a $35 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). Proceeds from the $80 million term loan were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Crest acquisition.\nKey Performance Measures\nFrom time to time we use certain key performance measures in evaluating our business and results of operations and we may refer to one or more of these key performance measures in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d These key performance measures include:\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Unit volume - We define unit volume as the number of our boats sold to our dealers during a period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Net sales per unit - We define net sales per unit as net sales divided by unit volume.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Gross margin - We define gross margin as gross profit divided by net sales, expressed as a percentage.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA - We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and unusual items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted Net Income - We define Adjusted Net Income as net income excluding income taxes adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and unusual items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations and an adjustment for income tax expense at a normalized annual effective tax rate. For a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income, see Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComponents of Results of Operations\nNet Sales\nWe generate sales from the sale of boats, trailers, and accessories to our dealers. The substantial majority of our net sales are derived from the sale of boats, including optional features included at the time of the initial wholesale purchase of the boat. Net sales consist of the following:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Gross sales, which are derived from:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Boat sales - sales of boats to our dealer network.

If a dealer meets certain volume levels over the course of the year during certain defined periods, the dealer will be entitled to a specified rebate. These rebates change annually and include volume and performance incentives. Dealers who participate in our floor plan financing program may be entitled to have their flooring costs subsidized by us to promote dealer orders in the off-season.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Sales\nOur cost of sales includes all of the costs to manufacture our products, including raw materials, components, supplies, direct labor, and factory overhead. For components and accessories manufactured by third-party vendors, our costs are the amounts invoiced to us by the vendors. Cost of sales includes shipping and handling costs, depreciation expense related to manufacturing equipment and facilities, and warranty costs associated with the repair or replacement of our boats under warranty.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses include selling and marketing costs, general and administrative costs, amortization of intangible assets and impairment losses. These items include personnel and related expenses, non-manufacturing overhead, and various other operating expenses. Further, selling and marketing expenditures include the cost of advertising and marketing materials. General and administrative expenses include, among other things, salaries, benefits, and other personnel related expenses for employees engaged in product development, engineering, finance, information technology, human resources, and executive management. Also included are outside legal and accounting fees, investor relations, risk management (insurance), and other administrative costs.\nOther Expense\nOther expense includes interest expense. Interest expense consists of interest charged under our credit facilities, amortization of deferred debt issuance costs, and deferred debt issuance costs written off in connection with the pay down of amounts owed on our credit facilities.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur accounting for income tax expense reflects management's assessment of future tax assets and liabilities based on assumptions and estimates for timing, likelihood of realization, and tax laws existing at the time of evaluation. We record a valuation allowance, when appropriate, to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nResults of Operations\nThe consolidated statements of operations presented below should be read together with Selected Consolidated Financial Data,\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nWe derived the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 from our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future.\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended June 30,\n</td>

Excluding this non-cash impairment charge, acquisition-related and integration costs, and start-up costs for Aviara, operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 0.1 percentage points to 9.5% for fiscal 2019 compared to 9.6% for fiscal 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Expense. Interest expense increased $3.0 million or 87.5%, to $6.5 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $3.5 million for fiscal 2018. The increase is due to increased borrowings for the Crest acquisition under the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement compared to the principal balance owed under the term loan component of the prior credit agreement during fiscal 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our results for fiscal 2018 reflect the impact of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Reform Act reduced federal corporate income tax rates and changed numerous other provisions. As we have a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate federal income tax rate was phased in, resulting in a U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 28.1% for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, and 21% for subsequent fiscal years. We have revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the reduced rates based on the period in which those assets and liabilities are expected to reverse. The incorporation of the changes resulting from the Tax Reform Act in our tax related accounts during fiscal 2018 resulted in a decrease to our year to date effective tax rate due to the revaluation of our deferred tax accounts. The fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 included a year-to-date benefit of $0.6 million to reflect federal deferred taxes at the lower blended effective tax rate.\nOur income tax expense was $5.4 million for fiscal 2019, reflecting a reported effective tax rate of 20.2%. Our income tax expense was $12.9 million for fiscal 2018, reflecting a reported effective tax rate of 24.5%. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was lower than the 21% statutory rate primarily due to the permanent benefit associated with the foreign derived intangible income deduction, which was primarily offset by the inclusion of the state tax rate in the overall effective rate.\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nNet Sales. Our net sales for fiscal 2018 were $332.7 million, reflecting an increase of $104.1 million, or 45.5%, compared to $228.6 million for fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to:\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> an increase of 16.5%, or $37.7 million, attributable to MasterCraft, primarily due to an increase in unit sales volume, reduced retail rebate activity, favorable product mix and price increases; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the inclusion of NauticStar increased net sales by 29.0%, or $66.4 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit. For fiscal 2018, our gross profit increased $26.9 million, or 42.4%, to $90.4 million compared to $63.5 million for fiscal 2017.

Interest expense increased $1.3 million or 56.3%, to $3.5 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $2.2 million for fiscal 2017. The increase is due to increased borrowings under the Third Term Loan compared to the principal balance owed under the term loan component of the Prior Credit Agreement during fiscal 2017.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our results for fiscal 2018 reflect the impact of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Reform Act reduced federal corporate income tax rates and changed numerous other provisions. As we have a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate federal income tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 28.1% for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, and 21% for subsequent fiscal years. We have revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the reduced rates based on the period in which those assets and liabilities are expected to reverse. The incorporation of the changes resulting from the Tax Reform Act in our tax related accounts during fiscal 2018 resulted in a decrease to our year to date effective tax rate due to the revaluation of our deferred tax accounts. The fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 included a year-to-date benefit of $647 to reflect federal deferred taxes at the lower blended effective tax rate.\nOur income tax expense was $12.9 million for fiscal 2018, reflecting a reported effective tax rate of 24.5%. Our income tax expense was $11.7 million for fiscal 2017, reflecting a reported effective tax rate of 37.5%. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was lower than the 28.1% statutory rate primarily due to the impact of the Tax Reform Act, and a permanent benefit associated with the domestic production activities deduction, which was partially offset by the inclusion of the state tax rate in the overall effective rate.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWe define EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, including goodwill and intangible impairment charges, transaction expenses associated with acquisitions, acquisition related inventory step-up adjustment, certain litigation charges, an out-of-period adjustment to correct an immaterial error related to our\nwarranty reserve, new brand startup costs, and our stock-based compensation. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales. We define Adjusted Net Income as net income adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, including goodwill and intangible impairment charges, transaction expenses associated with acquisitions, acquisition related inventory step-up adjustment, certain litigation charges, an out-of-period adjustment to correct an immaterial error related to our warranty reserve, new brand startup costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and our stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin , and Adjusted Net Income are not measures of net income or operating income as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which we refer to as GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are not measures of performance in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow for management's discretionary use. We believe that the inclusion of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Net Income is appropriate to provide additional information to investors because securities analysts, noteholders and other investors use these non-GAAP financial measures to assess our operating performance across periods on a consistent basis and to evaluate the relative risk of an investment in our securities. We use Adjusted Net Income to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP alone measures. We believe Adjusted Net Income assists our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our net income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes non-cash items and items not indicative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our tax expense or any cash requirements to pay income taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness;

Our principal sources of funds is cash generated from operating activities and the refinance and/or issuance of long-term debt. As of June 30, 2019, we had borrowing availability of $35.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. We believe our cash from operations, along with the ability to borrow, will be sufficient to provide for our liquidity and capital resource needs for at least the next 12 months.

This increase was primarily due to an increase in operating income of $8.3 million, excluding the non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $31.0 million. Our operating income grew from an increase in MasterCraft unit sales volume, price increases, and favorable product mix, partially offset by increased warranty costs and higher discounts related to retaliatory import tariff support for our Canadian and European Union dealers. The inclusion of Crest and NauticStar's incremental fiscal 2019 first quarter also drove the increase in our operating income. These increases were partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes and an increase in cash payments for interest related to the long-term debt used to fund the Crest acquisition.\nOur net cash provided by operating activities increased by $23.2 million, or 88.3%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, to $49.4 million from $26.2 million. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operating income of $22.5 million of which $15.8 million was attributable to our MasterCraft segment. Our MasterCraft segment operating income grew from an increase in unit sales volume, price increases, lower warranty costs and reduced retail rebate activity, partially offset by higher material costs. The inclusion of NauticStar increased our operating income by $6.6 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes and an increase in cash payments for interest related to an increase in our term loan balance when compared to the principal balance owed on our term loan during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $10.0 million for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. This increase was partially due to the acquisition of Crest in October 2018, for cash consideration of $81.0 million, net of cash on hand. Remaining capital outlays consisted of purchases for manufacturing infrastructure and expansion activities, molds, and equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $81.7 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of NauticStar in October 2017, for cash consideration of $80.5 million, net of cash on hand. Remaining capital outlays consisted of purchases for manufacturing infrastructure and expansion activities, molds, and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $2.8 million for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to greater principal repayments on long-term debt in fiscal 2019. Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of principal repayments and debt issuance costs, was $38.0 million and $40.3 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities increased $58.3 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher proceeds from issuance of long-term debt partially offset by higher principal repayments in fiscal 2018. Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of principal repayments and debt issuance costs, was $40.3 million and ($18.0) million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSenior Secured Credit Facility.\nOn October 1, 2018, the Company entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement with a syndicate of certain financial institutions (the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement\u201d). The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement replaced the Company's Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated October 2, 2017. The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement provides the Company with a $190 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $75 million term loan, and an $80 million term loan (together, the Term Loans\u201d), and a $35 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). Proceeds from the $80 million term loan were used to fund the Crest acquisition. The Term Loans will mature and all remaining amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on October 1, 2023.\nThe Fourth Amended Credit Agreement bears interest, at the Company's option, at either the prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.5% to 1.5% or at an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.5% to 2.5%, in each case based on the Company's senior leverage ratio. Based on the Company's senior leverage ratio as of June 30, 2019, the applicable margin for loans accruing interest at the prime rate is 0.75% and the applicable margin for loans accruing interest at LIBOR is 1.75%. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the effective interest rate on borrowings outstanding was 4.48% and 4.28%, respectively.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2019, the Company made $41.3 million of principal repayments on the Term Loans using cash generated from operations. Of this total, $32.7 million represented voluntary prepayments. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company's\nunamortized debt issuance costs related to the Term Loans were $1.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively. These costs are being amortized over the term of the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement.\nAs of June 30, 2019, the Company had no borrowings outstanding on its Revolving Credit Facility and the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $35 million. The Company's unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Revolving Credit Facility was $0.5 million and $0.4 million as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of June 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants under its Fourth Amended Credit Agreement.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements as of June 30, 2019.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of June 30, 2019, the Company's contractual cash obligations were as follows:\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-Term Debt Obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 115,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on Long-Term Debt Obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Lease Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase Obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Contractual Obligations(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 211,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> See Note 11 - Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's debt.

We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017. An adverse change in retail sales, however, could require us to repurchase repossessed units upon an event of default by any of our dealers, subject in some cases to an annual limitation. See Note 14 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for more information related to our obligations under our floor plan financing agreements.\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding stockholder advisory say-on-pay\u201d votes on executive compensation and stockholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation.\nThe JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can utilize the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, we have irrevocably chosen to opt out of such extended transition period and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for companies that are not emerging growth companies.\u201d\nWe will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least $1.07 billion, (ii) June 30, 2021, which is the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of completion of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.07 billion in non-convertible debt, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer,\u201d as defined under the Exchange Act.\nInflation\nThe market prices of certain materials and components used in manufacturing our products, especially resins that are made with hydrocarbon feedstocks, copper, aluminum, and stainless steel, can be volatile. Historically, however, inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations. Significant increases in inflation, particularly those related to wages and increases in the cost of raw materials, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNew boat buyers often finance their purchases. Inflation typically results in higher interest rates that could translate into an increased cost of boat ownership. Should inflation and increased interest rates occur, prospective consumers may choose to forego or delay their purchases or buy a less expensive boat in the event credit is not available to finance their boat purchases.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nA critical accounting policy\u201d is one which is both important to the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income (loss) to vary significantly from period to period.\nWe believe that the policies listed below involve the greatest degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to understand in order to evaluate fully our financial condition and results of operations. For additional information regarding these policies, see Note 3 - Significant Accounting Policies in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets - The Company does not amortize goodwill and other purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives. All of the Company's goodwill and intangible assets relate to either our MasterCraft, NauticStar, or Crest reporting units (see Note 16 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company's intangible assets with finite lives consist primarily of dealer networks and are carried at their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (see Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill results from the excess of purchase price over the net assets of businesses acquired. All three of the Company's reporting units, which are also the Company's reportable segments, have a goodwill balance.\nThe Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually, at fiscal yearend, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. As part of the annual test, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether the fair values of its reporting units are more likely than not\u201d to be greater than their carrying values. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including the effect of market or industry changes and the reporting units' actual results compared to projected results.\nIf the fair value of a reporting unit does not meet the \"more likely than not\" criteria discussed above, the impairment test for goodwill is a quantitative test. This test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nThe Company calculates the fair value of its reporting units considering both the income approach and market approach. The income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach. Internally forecasted future cash flows, which the Company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions, are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital ( Discount Rate\u201d) developed for each reporting unit. The Discount Rate is developed using market observable inputs, as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporting unit's forecasted performance. Fair value under the market approach is determined for each unit by applying market multiples for comparable public companies to the unit's financial results. The key uncertainties in these calculations are the assumptions used in determining the reporting unit's forecasted future performance, including revenue growth and operating margins, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate, along with selecting representative market multiples.\nAt June 30th of each year, we complete our annual impairment test when there are no other triggers during the year. We conducted a quantitative test at June 30, 2019 for all three reporting segments (reporting units), and as a result, recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $28 million related to the NauticStar reporting unit. This charge is included in Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment on the June 30, 2019 consolidated statement of operations. The impairment was principally a result of a decline, in the fiscal fourth quarter, in the outlook for sales and operating performance relative to our acquisition plan. NauticStar's core segment, the value-brand saltwater fishing boat segment, has experienced a recent slowing in demand, especially for boats less than 24 feet in length, which represent a material percentage of NauticStar's current model mix.\nNo goodwill impairment charges were recorded for the MasterCraft or Crest reporting units. It is possible that the Company's assumptions regarding the key uncertainties in these fair value calculations could change in the near term. If actual results differ from the Company's assumptions regarding the key uncertainties in these fair value calculations, it is possible that one or more of the Company's reporting units could incur goodwill impairment charges in future periods.\nOther Intangible Assets\nThe Company's primary intangible assets are dealer networks and trade names acquired in business combinations. Intangible assets are initially valued using a methodology commensurate with the intended use of the asset. The dealer networks were valued using an income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows from the dealer network through the application of the multi-period excess earnings approach. The fair value of trade names is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, a variation of the income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows. This method assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid to third parties had the Company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. The basis for future sales projections for these methods are based on internal revenue forecasts by reporting unit, which the Company believes represent reasonable market participant assumptions. The future cash flows are discounted using an applicable Discount Rate as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset.\nThe key uncertainties in these fair value calculations, as applicable, are: assumptions used in developing internal revenue growth and customer expense forecasts, assumed customer attrition rates, the selection of an appropriate royalty rate, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate.\nThe costs of amortizable intangible assets, including dealer networks, are recognized over their expected useful lives, approximately ten years for the dealer networks, using the straight-line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset may be impaired. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nDuring the goodwill assessment noted above, we also analyzed indefinite-lived assets, or trade names. As a result of our analysis, we recorded an impairment charge on trade names of $3 million related to the NauticStar reporting unit. This charge was included in Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment on the consolidated statement of operations. No other intangible asset impairment loss was recorded for the MasterCraft or Crest reporting units.\nIncome Taxes-We are subject to income taxes in the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rates, primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance and non-deductible expenses, as further described in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. Our effective tax rate was 20.2%, 24.5% and 37.5% for the fiscal years ended 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such\ndetermination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nRealization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods. If future events cause us to conclude that it is not more likely than not that we will be able to recover the value of our deferred tax assets, we are required to establish a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at that time.\nRevenue Recognition - The Company's revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats, marine parts, and accessories. The Company recognizes revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied and control over promised goods is transferred to a customer. For the majority of sales, this occurs when the product is released to the carrier responsible for transporting it to a customer. The Company typically receives payment within 5 days of shipment. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for a product. The Company offers discounts and sales incentives that include retail promotions, rebates, and floor plan reimbursement costs that are recorded as reductions of revenues in Net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The consideration recognized represents the amount specified in a contract with a customer, net of estimated dealer and retail sales incentives the Company reasonably expects to pay. The estimated liability and reduction in revenue for sales incentives is recorded at the time of sale. The Company estimates the amount of sales incentives based on historical data for specific boat models adjusted for forecasted sales volume, product mix, customer behavior and assumptions concerning market conditions. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible because actual results may differ from these estimates if market conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if dealer achievement or other items vary from historical trends.\nDealer Incentives\nDealer incentives include seasonal discounts, volume commitment rebates and other allowances. Dealer rebate and sales promotion incentives recorded during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, were $11.6 million, $6.4 million, and $5.7 million, respectively. Rebates that apply to boats already in dealer inventory are referred to as retail rebates. Retail rebates recorded during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, were $4.2 million, $1.9 million, and $5.5 million, respectively. Accrued rebates are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nDealers generally have no rights to return unsold boats. Occasionally, the Company may accept returns in limited circumstances and at the Company's discretion under its warranty policy (Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company may be obligated, in the event of default by a dealer, to accept returns of unsold boats under its repurchase commitment to floor financing providers, who are able to obtain such boats through foreclosure. The Company accrues the estimated fair value of this obligation based on the age of inventory currently under floor plan financing and estimated credit quality of dealers holding the inventory.\nFloor Plan Reimbursement Costs\nThe Company participates in various programs whereby it agrees to reimburse its dealers for certain floor plan interest costs incurred by such dealers for limited periods of time, generally ranging up to nine months. Such costs are included as a reduction in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations and totaled $7.5 million, $5.1 million, and $3.7 million for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nShipping and handling costs includes those costs incurred to transport product to customers and internal handling costs, which relate to activities to prepare goods for shipment. The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer as a fulfillment cost. The Company includes shipping and handling costs, including costs billed to customers, in Cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations.\nContract Liabilities\nA contract liability is created when customers prepay for goods prior to the Company transferring those goods to the customer. The contract liability is reduced once control of the goods is transferred to the customer. The difference between the opening and closing\nbalances of the Company's contract liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between the Company's performance and the point at which it receives pre-payment from the customer.\nOther Revenue Recognition Matters\nThe Company has excluded sales and other taxes assessed by a governmental authority in connection with revenue-producing activities from the determination of the transaction price for all contracts. The Company has not adjusted Net sales for the effects of a significant financing component because the period between the transfer of the promised goods and the customer's payment is expected to be one year or less.\nProduct Warranties - The Company offers warranties on the sale of certain products for periods of between one and five years. These warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the consumer. We estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty and record as a liability the amount of such costs at the time the product revenue is recognized. The key uncertainties that affect our estimate for warranty liability include anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as actual claims are determined or as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable.\nRepurchase Agreements - In connection with our dealers' wholesale floor plan financing of boats, we have entered into repurchase agreements with various lending institutions. The repurchase commitment is on an individual unit basis with a term from the date it is financed by the lending institution through payment date by the dealer, generally not exceeding two and a half years. Such agreements are customary in the industry and our exposure to loss under such agreements is limited by the resale value of the inventory which is required to be repurchased. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read together with the sections entitled Risk Factors,\u201d Selected Financial Data,\u201d and the financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this discussion and analysis regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding the performance of our business, anticipated financial results, liquidity and the other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the successful integration of NauticStar and Crest into our business and the risks and uncertainties described in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and in Risk Factors\u201d above. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nFiscal 2019 was a record year, with net sales of $466.4 million, an increase of 40.2% from fiscal 2018, primarily due to strong boat sales from our MasterCraft brand, the October 2018 acquisition of Crest, and the inclusion of NauticStar in our fiscal 2019 first quarter results.\nFull year net income of $21.4 million was a decrease of 46.2% from fiscal 2018, with diluted earnings per share decreasing 46.2% to $1.14 per share. The significant decrease was driven by the negative impact of a $31.0 million non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment at NauticStar principally as a result of a decline, in the fiscal fourth quarter, in the outlook for sales and operating performance relative to our acquisition plan. For more information regarding this impairment charge, see Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. NauticStar's core industry category, the value-brand saltwater fishing boat segment, has experienced a recent slowing in demand, especially for boats less than 24 feet in length, which represent a material percentage of NauticStar's current model mix. The decrease in net income and diluted earnings per share were offset by the Crest acquisition, which added $76.6 million in net sales, and continued strong operating results at MasterCraft.\nRecent Transactions\nAcquisition of Crest Marine, LLC\nOn October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Crest. The purchase price was $81.7 million, including customary adjustments for the amount of working capital in the acquired business at the closing date. A portion of the purchase price was deposited into an escrow account in order to secure certain post-closing obligations of the former members of Crest. The Company's results of operations presented herein include Crest's results from October 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019.\nFourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\nOn October 1, 2018, we entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement with a syndicate of certain financial institutions (the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement\u201d). The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement replaced the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated October 2, 2017. The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement provides us with a $190 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $75 million term loan and an $80 million term loan (together, the Term Loans\u201d) and a $35 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). Proceeds from the $80 million term loan were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Crest acquisition.\nKey Performance Measures\nFrom time to time we use certain key performance measures in evaluating our business and results of operations and we may refer to one or more of these key performance measures in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d These key performance measures include:\n \u2022 Unit volume - We define unit volume as the number of our boats sold to our dealers during a period. \n \u2022 Net sales per unit - We define net sales per unit as net sales divided by unit volume. \n \u2022 Gross margin - We define gross margin as gross profit divided by net sales, expressed as a percentage. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA - We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and unusual items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below. \n \u2022 Adjusted Net Income - We define Adjusted Net Income as net income excluding income taxes adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and unusual items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations and an adjustment for income tax expense at a normalized annual effective tax rate. For a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income, see Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below. \nComponents of Results of Operations\nNet Sales\nWe generate sales from the sale of boats, trailers, and accessories to our dealers. The substantial majority of our net sales are derived from the sale of boats, including optional features included at the time of the initial wholesale purchase of the boat. Net sales consist of the following:\n \u2022 Gross sales, which are derived from: \n \u2022 Boat sales - sales of boats to our dealer network. In addition, nearly all of our boat sales include optional feature upgrades, which increase the average selling price of our boats; and \n \u2022 Trailers, parts and accessories, and other revenues - sales of boat trailers, replacement and aftermarket boat parts and accessories, and transportation charges to our dealer network. \n \u2022 Net of: \n \u2022 Dealer programs and flooring subsidies - incentives, including rebates and subsidized flooring, we provide to our dealers to drive volume and level dealer purchases throughout the year. If a dealer meets certain volume levels over the course of the year during certain defined periods, the dealer will be entitled to a specified rebate. These rebates change annually and include volume and performance incentives. Dealers who participate in our floor plan financing program may be entitled to have their flooring costs subsidized by us to promote dealer orders in the off-season. \nCost of Sales\nOur cost of sales includes all of the costs to manufacture our products, including raw materials, components, supplies, direct labor, and factory overhead. For components and accessories manufactured by third-party vendors, our costs are the amounts invoiced to us by the vendors. Cost of sales includes shipping and handling costs, depreciation expense related to manufacturing equipment and facilities, and warranty costs associated with the repair or replacement of our boats under warranty.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses include selling and marketing costs, general and administrative costs, amortization of intangible assets and impairment losses. These items include personnel and related expenses, non-manufacturing overhead, and various other operating expenses. Further, selling and marketing expenditures include the cost of advertising and marketing materials. General and administrative expenses include, among other things, salaries, benefits, and other personnel related expenses for employees engaged in product development, engineering, finance, information technology, human resources, and executive management. Also included are outside legal and accounting fees, investor relations, risk management (insurance), and other administrative costs.\nOther Expense\nOther expense includes interest expense. Interest expense consists of interest charged under our credit facilities, amortization of deferred debt issuance costs, and deferred debt issuance costs written off in connection with the pay down of amounts owed on our credit facilities.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur accounting for income tax expense reflects management's assessment of future tax assets and liabilities based on assumptions and estimates for timing, likelihood of realization, and tax laws existing at the time of evaluation. We record a valuation allowance, when appropriate, to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nResults of Operations\nThe consolidated statements of operations presented below should be read together with Selected Consolidated Financial Data,\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nWe derived the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 from our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future.\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended June 30,\n</td>

Net Sales for fiscal 2019 were $466.4 million, an increase of $133.7 million, or 40.2%, compared to $332.7 million for fiscal 2018. The gain was primarily due to:\n \u2022 an increase at MasterCraft of $45.5 million, or 17.1%, primarily driven by an increase in unit sales volume, favorable product mix and price increases, offset by higher discounts to support our Canadian and European Union dealers impacted by retaliatory import tariffs; \n \u2022 the inclusion of Crest, which grew net sales by $76.6 million; and \n \u2022 a net $11.6 million increase in net sales for NauticStar, driven by the inclusion of NauticStar in our fiscal 2019 first quarter results, partially offset by a decrease in volume due to softness in NauticStar's core market. \nGross Profit. Gross profit increased $22.8 million, or 25.2%, to $113.1 million compared to $90.4 million for fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to:\n \u2022 an increase in MasterCraft unit sales volumes, price increases, and favorable product mix, offset by increased warranty costs and higher discounts to support Canadian and European Union dealers impacted by retaliatory import tariffs; \n \u2022 the inclusion of Crest, which contributed $13.6 million to gross profit; and partially offset by \n \u2022 a net $1.2 million decrease in gross profit for NauticStar, primarily driven by a decrease in volume, partially offset by the inclusion of NauticStar in our fiscal 2019 first quarter results. \nGiven the above-mentioned factors, gross margin decreased to 24.3% for fiscal 2019 compared to 27.2% for fiscal 2018.\nOperating Expenses.\n \u2022 Operating expenses increased $45.5 million, or 132.3%, to $79.9 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $34.4 million for fiscal 2018. This increase resulted mainly from: \n o the $31.0 million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge at NauticStar (see Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information); \n o the inclusion of Crest, which increased operating expenses by $6.5 million; \n o an increase of $2.3 million in startup costs related to Aviara; \n o the incremental inclusion of NauticStar in our fiscal 2019 first quarter results, which added $1.9 million; and \n o an increase of $1.9 million in intangible asset amortization, which includes the effects of both the NauticStar and Crest acquisitions, principally for dealer networks. \n \u2022 Operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 6.8 percentage points to 17.1% for fiscal 2019 compared to 10.3% for fiscal 2018. This increase resulted primarily from the $31.0 million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge at NauticStar. Excluding this non-cash impairment charge, acquisition-related and integration costs, and start-up costs for Aviara, operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 0.1 percentage points to 9.5% for fiscal 2019 compared to 9.6% for fiscal 2018. \nOther Expense. Interest expense increased $3.0 million or 87.5%, to $6.5 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $3.5 million for fiscal 2018. The increase is due to increased borrowings for the Crest acquisition under the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement compared to the principal balance owed under the term loan component of the prior credit agreement during fiscal 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our results for fiscal 2018 reflect the impact of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Reform Act reduced federal corporate income tax rates and changed numerous other provisions. As we have a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate federal income tax rate was phased in, resulting in a U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 28.1% for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, and 21% for subsequent fiscal years. We have revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the reduced rates based on the period in which those assets and liabilities are expected to reverse. The incorporation of the changes resulting from the Tax Reform Act in our tax related accounts during fiscal 2018 resulted in a decrease to our year to date effective tax rate due to the revaluation of our deferred tax accounts. The fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 included a year-to-date benefit of $0.6 million to reflect federal deferred taxes at the lower blended effective tax rate.\nOur income tax expense was $5.4 million for fiscal 2019, reflecting a reported effective tax rate of 20.2%. Our income tax expense was $12.9 million for fiscal 2018, reflecting a reported effective tax rate of 24.5%. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was lower than the 21% statutory rate primarily due to the permanent benefit associated with the foreign derived intangible income deduction, which was primarily offset by the inclusion of the state tax rate in the overall effective rate.\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nNet Sales. Our net sales for fiscal 2018 were $332.7 million, reflecting an increase of $104.1 million, or 45.5%, compared to $228.6 million for fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to:\n \u2022 an increase of 16.5%, or $37.7 million, attributable to MasterCraft, primarily due to an increase in unit sales volume, reduced retail rebate activity, favorable product mix and price increases; and \n \u2022 the inclusion of NauticStar increased net sales by 29.0%, or $66.4 million. \nGross Profit. For fiscal 2018, our gross profit increased $26.9 million, or 42.4%, to $90.4 million compared to $63.5 million for fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to:\n \u2022 an increase in MasterCraft unit sales volume, price increases, lower warranty costs and reduced retail rebate activity, partially offset by higher material costs; and \n \u2022 the inclusion of NauticStar, which contributed $12.3 million to gross profit. \nGross margin decreased to 27.2% for fiscal 2018 compared to 27.8% for fiscal 2017. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the dilutive effect from the inclusion of NauticStar, which was partially offset by increased gross margin of MasterCraft.\nOperating Expenses.\n \u2022 Operating expenses increased $4.4 million, or 14.8%, to $34.4 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $30.0 million for fiscal 2017. This increase resulted mainly from: \n o the inclusion of NauticStar, which increased operating expenses by $5.6 million; \n o an increase in compensation costs; \n o an increase of $1.7 million for acquisition-related and integration costs, \n o and $0.6 million related to new brand startup costs; partially offset by \n o a decrease of $5.9 million in patent litigation costs, which was settled during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. \n \u2022 Operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased by 2.8 percentage points to 10.3% for fiscal 2018 compared to 13.1% for fiscal 2017. This favorable impact resulted from leverage experienced through significant net sales increases compared to the net increases in operating expenses. \nOther Expense. Interest expense increased $1.3 million or 56.3%, to $3.5 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $2.2 million for fiscal 2017. The increase is due to increased borrowings under the Third Term Loan compared to the principal balance owed under the term loan component of the Prior Credit Agreement during fiscal 2017.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our results for fiscal 2018 reflect the impact of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Reform Act reduced federal corporate income tax rates and changed numerous other provisions. As we have a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate federal income tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 28.1% for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, and 21% for subsequent fiscal years. We have revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the reduced rates based on the period in which those assets and liabilities are expected to reverse. The incorporation of the changes resulting from the Tax Reform Act in our tax related accounts during fiscal 2018 resulted in a decrease to our year to date effective tax rate due to the revaluation of our deferred tax accounts. The fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 included a year-to-date benefit of $647 to reflect federal deferred taxes at the lower blended effective tax rate.\nOur income tax expense was $12.9 million for fiscal 2018, reflecting a reported effective tax rate of 24.5%. Our income tax expense was $11.7 million for fiscal 2017, reflecting a reported effective tax rate of 37.5%. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was lower than the 28.1% statutory rate primarily due to the impact of the Tax Reform Act, and a permanent benefit associated with the domestic production activities deduction, which was partially offset by the inclusion of the state tax rate in the overall effective rate.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWe define EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, including goodwill and intangible impairment charges, transaction expenses associated with acquisitions, acquisition related inventory step-up adjustment, certain litigation charges, an out-of-period adjustment to correct an immaterial error related to our\nwarranty reserve, new brand startup costs, and our stock-based compensation. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales. We define Adjusted Net Income as net income adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, including goodwill and intangible impairment charges, transaction expenses associated with acquisitions, acquisition related inventory step-up adjustment, certain litigation charges, an out-of-period adjustment to correct an immaterial error related to our warranty reserve, new brand startup costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and our stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin , and Adjusted Net Income are not measures of net income or operating income as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which we refer to as GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are not measures of performance in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow for management's discretionary use. We believe that the inclusion of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Net Income is appropriate to provide additional information to investors because securities analysts, noteholders and other investors use these non-GAAP financial measures to assess our operating performance across periods on a consistent basis and to evaluate the relative risk of an investment in our securities. We use Adjusted Net Income to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP alone measures. We believe Adjusted Net Income assists our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our net income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes non-cash items and items not indicative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u2022 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

Our principal sources of funds is cash generated from operating activities and the refinance and/or issuance of long-term debt. As of June 30, 2019, we had borrowing availability of $35.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. We believe our cash from operations, along with the ability to borrow, will be sufficient to provide for our liquidity and capital resource needs for at least the next 12 months. The following table summarizes the cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (95,786\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85,720\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,135\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,132\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,083\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur net cash provided by operating activities increased by $6.5 million, or 13.1%, for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, to $55.9 million from $49.4 million. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operating income of $8.3 million, excluding the non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $31.0 million. Our operating income grew from an increase in MasterCraft unit sales volume, price increases, and favorable product mix, partially offset by increased warranty costs and higher discounts related to retaliatory import tariff support for our Canadian and European Union dealers. The inclusion of Crest and NauticStar's incremental fiscal 2019 first quarter also drove the increase in our operating income. These increases were partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes and an increase in cash payments for interest related to the long-term debt used to fund the Crest acquisition.\nOur net cash provided by operating activities increased by $23.2 million, or 88.3%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, to $49.4 million from $26.2 million. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operating income of $22.5 million of which $15.8 million was attributable to our MasterCraft segment. Our MasterCraft segment operating income grew from an increase in unit sales volume, price increases, lower warranty costs and reduced retail rebate activity, partially offset by higher material costs. The inclusion of NauticStar increased our operating income by $6.6 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes and an increase in cash payments for interest related to an increase in our term loan balance when compared to the principal balance owed on our term loan during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $10.0 million for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. This increase was partially due to the acquisition of Crest in October 2018, for cash consideration of $81.0 million, net of cash on hand. Remaining capital outlays consisted of purchases for manufacturing infrastructure and expansion activities, molds, and equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $81.7 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of NauticStar in October 2017, for cash consideration of $80.5 million, net of cash on hand. Remaining capital outlays consisted of purchases for manufacturing infrastructure and expansion activities, molds, and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $2.8 million for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to greater principal repayments on long-term debt in fiscal 2019. Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of principal repayments and debt issuance costs, was $38.0 million and $40.3 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities increased $58.3 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher proceeds from issuance of long-term debt partially offset by higher principal repayments in fiscal 2018. Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of principal repayments and debt issuance costs, was $40.3 million and ($18.0) million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSenior Secured Credit Facility.\nOn October 1, 2018, the Company entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement with a syndicate of certain financial institutions (the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement\u201d). The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement replaced the Company's Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated October 2, 2017. The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement provides the Company with a $190 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $75 million term loan, and an $80 million term loan (together, the Term Loans\u201d), and a $35 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). Proceeds from the $80 million term loan were used to fund the Crest acquisition. The Term Loans will mature and all remaining amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on October 1, 2023.\nThe Fourth Amended Credit Agreement bears interest, at the Company's option, at either the prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.5% to 1.5% or at an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.5% to 2.5%, in each case based on the Company's senior leverage ratio. Based on the Company's senior leverage ratio as of June 30, 2019, the applicable margin for loans accruing interest at the prime rate is 0.75% and the applicable margin for loans accruing interest at LIBOR is 1.75%. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the effective interest rate on borrowings outstanding was 4.48% and 4.28%, respectively.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2019, the Company made $41.3 million of principal repayments on the Term Loans using cash generated from operations. Of this total, $32.7 million represented voluntary prepayments. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company's\nunamortized debt issuance costs related to the Term Loans were $1.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively. These costs are being amortized over the term of the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement.\nAs of June 30, 2019, the Company had no borrowings outstanding on its Revolving Credit Facility and the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $35 million. The Company's unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Revolving Credit Facility was $0.5 million and $0.4 million as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of June 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants under its Fourth Amended Credit Agreement.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements as of June 30, 2019.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of June 30, 2019, the Company's contractual cash obligations were as follows:\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-Term Debt Obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 115,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on Long-Term Debt Obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Lease Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase Obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Contractual Obligations(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 211,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) See Note 11 - Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's debt.

See Note 12 - Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nRepurchase Obligations - The Company has reserves to cover potential losses associated with repurchase obligations based on historical experience and current facts and circumstances. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017. An adverse change in retail sales, however, could require us to repurchase repossessed units upon an event of default by any of our dealers, subject in some cases to an annual limitation. See Note 14 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for more information related to our obligations under our floor plan financing agreements.\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding stockholder advisory say-on-pay\u201d votes on executive compensation and stockholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation.\nThe JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can utilize the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, we have irrevocably chosen to opt out of such extended transition period and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for companies that are not emerging growth companies.\u201d\nWe will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least $1.07 billion, (ii) June 30, 2021, which is the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of completion of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.07 billion in non-convertible debt, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer,\u201d as defined under the Exchange Act.\nInflation\nThe market prices of certain materials and components used in manufacturing our products, especially resins that are made with hydrocarbon feedstocks, copper, aluminum, and stainless steel, can be volatile. Historically, however, inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations. Significant increases in inflation, particularly those related to wages and increases in the cost of raw materials, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNew boat buyers often finance their purchases. Inflation typically results in higher interest rates that could translate into an increased cost of boat ownership. Should inflation and increased interest rates occur, prospective consumers may choose to forego or delay their purchases or buy a less expensive boat in the event credit is not available to finance their boat purchases.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nA critical accounting policy\u201d is one which is both important to the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income (loss) to vary significantly from period to period.\nWe believe that the policies listed below involve the greatest degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to understand in order to evaluate fully our financial condition and results of operations. For additional information regarding these policies, see Note 3 - Significant Accounting Policies in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets - The Company does not amortize goodwill and other purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives. All of the Company's goodwill and intangible assets relate to either our MasterCraft, NauticStar, or Crest reporting units (see Note 16 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company's intangible assets with finite lives consist primarily of dealer networks and are carried at their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (see Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill results from the excess of purchase price over the net assets of businesses acquired. All three of the Company's reporting units, which are also the Company's reportable segments, have a goodwill balance.\nThe Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually, at fiscal yearend, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. As part of the annual test, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether the fair values of its reporting units are more likely than not\u201d to be greater than their carrying values. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including the effect of market or industry changes and the reporting units' actual results compared to projected results.\nIf the fair value of a reporting unit does not meet the \"more likely than not\" criteria discussed above, the impairment test for goodwill is a quantitative test. This test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nThe Company calculates the fair value of its reporting units considering both the income approach and market approach. The income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach. Internally forecasted future cash flows, which the Company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions, are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital ( Discount Rate\u201d) developed for each reporting unit. The Discount Rate is developed using market observable inputs, as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporting unit's forecasted performance. Fair value under the market approach is determined for each unit by applying market multiples for comparable public companies to the unit's financial results. The key uncertainties in these calculations are the assumptions used in determining the reporting unit's forecasted future performance, including revenue growth and operating margins, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate, along with selecting representative market multiples.\nAt June 30th of each year, we complete our annual impairment test when there are no other triggers during the year. We conducted a quantitative test at June 30, 2019 for all three reporting segments (reporting units), and as a result, recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $28 million related to the NauticStar reporting unit. This charge is included in Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment on the June 30, 2019 consolidated statement of operations. The impairment was principally a result of a decline, in the fiscal fourth quarter, in the outlook for sales and operating performance relative to our acquisition plan. NauticStar's core segment, the value-brand saltwater fishing boat segment, has experienced a recent slowing in demand, especially for boats less than 24 feet in length, which represent a material percentage of NauticStar's current model mix.\nNo goodwill impairment charges were recorded for the MasterCraft or Crest reporting units. It is possible that the Company's assumptions regarding the key uncertainties in these fair value calculations could change in the near term. If actual results differ from the Company's assumptions regarding the key uncertainties in these fair value calculations, it is possible that one or more of the Company's reporting units could incur goodwill impairment charges in future periods.\nOther Intangible Assets\nThe Company's primary intangible assets are dealer networks and trade names acquired in business combinations. Intangible assets are initially valued using a methodology commensurate with the intended use of the asset. The dealer networks were valued using an income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows from the dealer network through the application of the multi-period excess earnings approach. The fair value of trade names is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, a variation of the income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows. This method assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid to third parties had the Company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. The basis for future sales projections for these methods are based on internal revenue forecasts by reporting unit, which the Company believes represent reasonable market participant assumptions. The future cash flows are discounted using an applicable Discount Rate as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset.\nThe key uncertainties in these fair value calculations, as applicable, are: assumptions used in developing internal revenue growth and customer expense forecasts, assumed customer attrition rates, the selection of an appropriate royalty rate, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate.\nThe costs of amortizable intangible assets, including dealer networks, are recognized over their expected useful lives, approximately ten years for the dealer networks, using the straight-line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset may be impaired. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nDuring the goodwill assessment noted above, we also analyzed indefinite-lived assets, or trade names. As a result of our analysis, we recorded an impairment charge on trade names of $3 million related to the NauticStar reporting unit. This charge was included in Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment on the consolidated statement of operations. No other intangible asset impairment loss was recorded for the MasterCraft or Crest reporting units.\nIncome Taxes-We are subject to income taxes in the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rates, primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance and non-deductible expenses, as further described in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. Our effective tax rate was 20.2%, 24.5% and 37.5% for the fiscal years ended 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such\ndetermination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nRealization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods. If future events cause us to conclude that it is not more likely than not that we will be able to recover the value of our deferred tax assets, we are required to establish a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at that time.\nRevenue Recognition - The Company's revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats, marine parts, and accessories. The Company recognizes revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied and control over promised goods is transferred to a customer. For the majority of sales, this occurs when the product is released to the carrier responsible for transporting it to a customer. The Company typically receives payment within 5 days of shipment. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for a product. The Company offers discounts and sales incentives that include retail promotions, rebates, and floor plan reimbursement costs that are recorded as reductions of revenues in Net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The consideration recognized represents the amount specified in a contract with a customer, net of estimated dealer and retail sales incentives the Company reasonably expects to pay. The estimated liability and reduction in revenue for sales incentives is recorded at the time of sale. The Company estimates the amount of sales incentives based on historical data for specific boat models adjusted for forecasted sales volume, product mix, customer behavior and assumptions concerning market conditions. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible because actual results may differ from these estimates if market conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if dealer achievement or other items vary from historical trends.\nDealer Incentives\nDealer incentives include seasonal discounts, volume commitment rebates and other allowances. Dealer rebate and sales promotion incentives recorded during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, were $11.6 million, $6.4 million, and $5.7 million, respectively. Rebates that apply to boats already in dealer inventory are referred to as retail rebates. Retail rebates recorded during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, were $4.2 million, $1.9 million, and $5.5 million, respectively. Accrued rebates are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nDealers generally have no rights to return unsold boats. Occasionally, the Company may accept returns in limited circumstances and at the Company's discretion under its warranty policy (Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company may be obligated, in the event of default by a dealer, to accept returns of unsold boats under its repurchase commitment to floor financing providers, who are able to obtain such boats through foreclosure. The Company accrues the estimated fair value of this obligation based on the age of inventory currently under floor plan financing and estimated credit quality of dealers holding the inventory.\nFloor Plan Reimbursement Costs\nThe Company participates in various programs whereby it agrees to reimburse its dealers for certain floor plan interest costs incurred by such dealers for limited periods of time, generally ranging up to nine months. Such costs are included as a reduction in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations and totaled $7.5 million, $5.1 million, and $3.7 million for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nShipping and handling costs includes those costs incurred to transport product to customers and internal handling costs, which relate to activities to prepare goods for shipment. The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer as a fulfillment cost. The Company includes shipping and handling costs, including costs billed to customers, in Cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations.\nContract Liabilities\nA contract liability is created when customers prepay for goods prior to the Company transferring those goods to the customer. The contract liability is reduced once control of the goods is transferred to the customer. The difference between the opening and closing\nbalances of the Company's contract liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between the Company's performance and the point at which it receives pre-payment from the customer.\nOther Revenue Recognition Matters\nThe Company has excluded sales and other taxes assessed by a governmental authority in connection with revenue-producing activities from the determination of the transaction price for all contracts. The Company has not adjusted Net sales for the effects of a significant financing component because the period between the transfer of the promised goods and the customer's payment is expected to be one year or less.\nProduct Warranties - The Company offers warranties on the sale of certain products for periods of between one and five years. These warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the consumer. We estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty and record as a liability the amount of such costs at the time the product revenue is recognized. The key uncertainties that affect our estimate for warranty liability include anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as actual claims are determined or as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable.\nRepurchase Agreements - In connection with our dealers' wholesale floor plan financing of boats, we have entered into repurchase agreements with various lending institutions. The repurchase commitment is on an individual unit basis with a term from the date it is financed by the lending institution through payment date by the dealer, generally not exceeding two and a half years. Such agreements are customary in the industry and our exposure to loss under such agreements is limited by the resale value of the inventory which is required to be repurchased. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read together with the sections entitled Risk Factors,\u201d Selected Financial Data,\u201d and the financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this discussion and analysis regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding the performance of our business, anticipated financial results, liquidity and the other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the successful integration of NauticStar and Crest into our business and the risks and uncertainties described in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and in Risk Factors\u201d above. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nFiscal 2019 was a record year, with net sales of $466.4 million, an increase of 40.2% from fiscal 2018, primarily due to strong boat sales from our MasterCraft brand, the October 2018 acquisition of Crest, and the inclusion of NauticStar in our fiscal 2019 first quarter results.\nFull year net income of $21.4 million was a decrease of 46.2% from fiscal 2018, with diluted earnings per share decreasing 46.2% to $1.14 per share. The significant decrease was driven by the negative impact of a $31.0 million non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment at NauticStar principally as a result of a decline, in the fiscal fourth quarter, in the outlook for sales and operating performance relative to our acquisition plan. For more information regarding this impairment charge, see Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. NauticStar's core industry category, the value-brand saltwater fishing boat segment, has experienced a recent slowing in demand, especially for boats less than 24 feet in length, which represent a material percentage of NauticStar's current model mix. The decrease in net income and diluted earnings per share were offset by the Crest acquisition, which added $76.6 million in net sales, and continued strong operating results at MasterCraft.\nRecent Transactions\nAcquisition of Crest Marine, LLC\nOn October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Crest. The purchase price was $81.7 million, including customary adjustments for the amount of working capital in the acquired business at the closing date. A portion of the purchase price was deposited into an escrow account in order to secure certain post-closing obligations of the former members of Crest. The Company's results of operations presented herein include Crest's results from October 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019.\nFourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\nOn October 1, 2018, we entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement with a syndicate of certain financial institutions (the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement\u201d). The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement replaced the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated October 2, 2017. The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement provides us with a $190 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $75 million term loan and an $80 million term loan (together, the Term Loans\u201d) and a $35 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). Proceeds from the $80 million term loan were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Crest acquisition.\nKey Performance Measures\nFrom time to time we use certain key performance measures in evaluating our business and results of operations and we may refer to one or more of these key performance measures in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d These key performance measures include:\n \u2022 Unit volume - We define unit volume as the number of our boats sold to our dealers during a period. \n \u2022 Net sales per unit - We define net sales per unit as net sales divided by unit volume. \n \u2022 Gross margin - We define gross margin as gross profit divided by net sales, expressed as a percentage. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA - We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and unusual items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below. \n \u2022 Adjusted Net Income - We define Adjusted Net Income as net income excluding income taxes adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and unusual items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations and an adjustment for income tax expense at a normalized annual effective tax rate. For a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income, see Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below. \nComponents of Results of Operations\nNet Sales\nWe generate sales from the sale of boats, trailers, and accessories to our dealers. The substantial majority of our net sales are derived from the sale of boats, including optional features included at the time of the initial wholesale purchase of the boat. Net sales consist of the following:\n \u2022 Gross sales, which are derived from: \n \u2022 Boat sales - sales of boats to our dealer network. In addition, nearly all of our boat sales include optional feature upgrades, which increase the average selling price of our boats; and \n \u2022 Trailers, parts and accessories, and other revenues - sales of boat trailers, replacement and aftermarket boat parts and accessories, and transportation charges to our dealer network. \n \u2022 Net of: \n \u2022 Dealer programs and flooring subsidies - incentives, including rebates and subsidized flooring, we provide to our dealers to drive volume and level dealer purchases throughout the year. If a dealer meets certain volume levels over the course of the year during certain defined periods, the dealer will be entitled to a specified rebate. These rebates change annually and include volume and performance incentives. Dealers who participate in our floor plan financing program may be entitled to have their flooring costs subsidized by us to promote dealer orders in the off-season. \nCost of Sales\nOur cost of sales includes all of the costs to manufacture our products, including raw materials, components, supplies, direct labor, and factory overhead. For components and accessories manufactured by third-party vendors, our costs are the amounts invoiced to us by the vendors. Cost of sales includes shipping and handling costs, depreciation expense related to manufacturing equipment and facilities, and warranty costs associated with the repair or replacement of our boats under warranty.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses include selling and marketing costs, general and administrative costs, amortization of intangible assets and impairment losses. These items include personnel and related expenses, non-manufacturing overhead, and various other operating expenses. Further, selling and marketing expenditures include the cost of advertising and marketing materials. General and administrative expenses include, among other things, salaries, benefits, and other personnel related expenses for employees engaged in product development, engineering, finance, information technology, human resources, and executive management. Also included are outside legal and accounting fees, investor relations, risk management (insurance), and other administrative costs.\nOther Expense\nOther expense includes interest expense. Interest expense consists of interest charged under our credit facilities, amortization of deferred debt issuance costs, and deferred debt issuance costs written off in connection with the pay down of amounts owed on our credit facilities.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur accounting for income tax expense reflects management's assessment of future tax assets and liabilities based on assumptions and estimates for timing, likelihood of realization, and tax laws existing at the time of evaluation. We record a valuation allowance, when appropriate, to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nResults of Operations\nThe consolidated statements of operations presented below should be read together with Selected Consolidated Financial Data,\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nWe derived the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 from our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future.\n\nFiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018\nNet Sales. Net Sales for fiscal 2019 were $466.4 million, an increase of $133.7 million, or 40.2%, compared to $332.7 million for fiscal 2018. The gain was primarily due to:\n \u2022 an increase at MasterCraft of $45.5 million, or 17.1%, primarily driven by an increase in unit sales volume, favorable product mix and price increases, offset by higher discounts to support our Canadian and European Union dealers impacted by retaliatory import tariffs; \n \u2022 the inclusion of Crest, which grew net sales by $76.6 million; and \n \u2022 a net $11.6 million increase in net sales for NauticStar, driven by the inclusion of NauticStar in our fiscal 2019 first quarter results, partially offset by a decrease in volume due to softness in NauticStar's core market. \nGross Profit. Gross profit increased $22.8 million, or 25.2%, to $113.1 million compared to $90.4 million for fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to:\n \u2022 an increase in MasterCraft unit sales volumes, price increases, and favorable product mix, offset by increased warranty costs and higher discounts to support Canadian and European Union dealers impacted by retaliatory import tariffs; \n \u2022 the inclusion of Crest, which contributed $13.6 million to gross profit; and partially offset by \n \u2022 a net $1.2 million decrease in gross profit for NauticStar, primarily driven by a decrease in volume, partially offset by the inclusion of NauticStar in our fiscal 2019 first quarter results. \nGiven the above-mentioned factors, gross margin decreased to 24.3% for fiscal 2019 compared to 27.2% for fiscal 2018.\nOperating Expenses.\n \u2022 Operating expenses increased $45.5 million, or 132.3%, to $79.9 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $34.4 million for fiscal 2018. This increase resulted mainly from: \n o the $31.0 million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge at NauticStar (see Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information); \n o the inclusion of Crest, which increased operating expenses by $6.5 million; \n o an increase of $2.3 million in startup costs related to Aviara; \n o the incremental inclusion of NauticStar in our fiscal 2019 first quarter results, which added $1.9 million; and \n o an increase of $1.9 million in intangible asset amortization, which includes the effects of both the NauticStar and Crest acquisitions, principally for dealer networks. \n \u2022 Operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 6.8 percentage points to 17.1% for fiscal 2019 compared to 10.3% for fiscal 2018. This increase resulted primarily from the $31.0 million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge at NauticStar. Excluding this non-cash impairment charge, acquisition-related and integration costs, and start-up costs for Aviara, operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 0.1 percentage points to 9.5% for fiscal 2019 compared to 9.6% for fiscal 2018. \nOther Expense. Interest expense increased $3.0 million or 87.5%, to $6.5 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $3.5 million for fiscal 2018. The increase is due to increased borrowings for the Crest acquisition under the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement compared to the principal balance owed under the term loan component of the prior credit agreement during fiscal 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our results for fiscal 2018 reflect the impact of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Reform Act reduced federal corporate income tax rates and changed numerous other provisions. As we have a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate federal income tax rate was phased in, resulting in a U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 28.1% for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, and 21% for subsequent fiscal years. We have revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the reduced rates based on the period in which those assets and liabilities are expected to reverse. The incorporation of the changes resulting from the Tax Reform Act in our tax related accounts during fiscal 2018 resulted in a decrease to our year to date effective tax rate due to the revaluation of our deferred tax accounts. The fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 included a year-to-date benefit of $0.6 million to reflect federal deferred taxes at the lower blended effective tax rate.\nOur income tax expense was $5.4 million for fiscal 2019, reflecting a reported effective tax rate of 20.2%. Our income tax expense was $12.9 million for fiscal 2018, reflecting a reported effective tax rate of 24.5%. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was lower than the 21% statutory rate primarily due to the permanent benefit associated with the foreign derived intangible income deduction, which was primarily offset by the inclusion of the state tax rate in the overall effective rate.\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nNet Sales. Our net sales for fiscal 2018 were $332.7 million, reflecting an increase of $104.1 million, or 45.5%, compared to $228.6 million for fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to:\n \u2022 an increase of 16.5%, or $37.7 million, attributable to MasterCraft, primarily due to an increase in unit sales volume, reduced retail rebate activity, favorable product mix and price increases; and \n \u2022 the inclusion of NauticStar increased net sales by 29.0%, or $66.4 million. \nGross Profit. For fiscal 2018, our gross profit increased $26.9 million, or 42.4%, to $90.4 million compared to $63.5 million for fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to:\n \u2022 an increase in MasterCraft unit sales volume, price increases, lower warranty costs and reduced retail rebate activity, partially offset by higher material costs; and \n \u2022 the inclusion of NauticStar, which contributed $12.3 million to gross profit. \nGross margin decreased to 27.2% for fiscal 2018 compared to 27.8% for fiscal 2017. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the dilutive effect from the inclusion of NauticStar, which was partially offset by increased gross margin of MasterCraft.\nOperating Expenses.\n \u2022 Operating expenses increased $4.4 million, or 14.8%, to $34.4 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $30.0 million for fiscal 2017. This increase resulted mainly from: \n o the inclusion of NauticStar, which increased operating expenses by $5.6 million; \n o an increase in compensation costs; \n o an increase of $1.7 million for acquisition-related and integration costs, \n o and $0.6 million related to new brand startup costs; partially offset by \n o a decrease of $5.9 million in patent litigation costs, which was settled during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. \n \u2022 Operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased by 2.8 percentage points to 10.3% for fiscal 2018 compared to 13.1% for fiscal 2017. This favorable impact resulted from leverage experienced through significant net sales increases compared to the net increases in operating expenses. \nOther Expense. Interest expense increased $1.3 million or 56.3%, to $3.5 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $2.2 million for fiscal 2017. The increase is due to increased borrowings under the Third Term Loan compared to the principal balance owed under the term loan component of the Prior Credit Agreement during fiscal 2017.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our results for fiscal 2018 reflect the impact of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Reform Act reduced federal corporate income tax rates and changed numerous other provisions. As we have a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate federal income tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 28.1% for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, and 21% for subsequent fiscal years. We have revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the reduced rates based on the period in which those assets and liabilities are expected to reverse. The incorporation of the changes resulting from the Tax Reform Act in our tax related accounts during fiscal 2018 resulted in a decrease to our year to date effective tax rate due to the revaluation of our deferred tax accounts. The fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 included a year-to-date benefit of $647 to reflect federal deferred taxes at the lower blended effective tax rate.\nOur income tax expense was $12.9 million for fiscal 2018, reflecting a reported effective tax rate of 24.5%. Our income tax expense was $11.7 million for fiscal 2017, reflecting a reported effective tax rate of 37.5%. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was lower than the 28.1% statutory rate primarily due to the impact of the Tax Reform Act, and a permanent benefit associated with the domestic production activities deduction, which was partially offset by the inclusion of the state tax rate in the overall effective rate.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWe define EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, including goodwill and intangible impairment charges, transaction expenses associated with acquisitions, acquisition related inventory step-up adjustment, certain litigation charges, an out-of-period adjustment to correct an immaterial error related to our\nwarranty reserve, new brand startup costs, and our stock-based compensation. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales. We define Adjusted Net Income as net income adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, including goodwill and intangible impairment charges, transaction expenses associated with acquisitions, acquisition related inventory step-up adjustment, certain litigation charges, an out-of-period adjustment to correct an immaterial error related to our warranty reserve, new brand startup costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and our stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin , and Adjusted Net Income are not measures of net income or operating income as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which we refer to as GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are not measures of performance in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow for management's discretionary use. We believe that the inclusion of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Net Income is appropriate to provide additional information to investors because securities analysts, noteholders and other investors use these non-GAAP financial measures to assess our operating performance across periods on a consistent basis and to evaluate the relative risk of an investment in our securities. We use Adjusted Net Income to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP alone measures. We believe Adjusted Net Income assists our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our net income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes non-cash items and items not indicative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u2022 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our tax expense or any cash requirements to pay income taxes; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness; and \n \u2022 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, but may nonetheless have a material impact on our results of operations. \nIn addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated (unaudited):\n\n (a) Represents a non-cash charge recorded in the NauticStar segment for a $28.0 million impairment of goodwill and a $3.0 million impairment of trade name.

Our principal sources of funds is cash generated from operating activities and the refinance and/or issuance of long-term debt. As of June 30, 2019, we had borrowing availability of $35.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. We believe our cash from operations, along with the ability to borrow, will be sufficient to provide for our liquidity and capital resource needs for at least the next 12 months. The following table summarizes the cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities:\n\nOperating Activities\nOur net cash provided by operating activities increased by $6.5 million, or 13.1%, for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, to $55.9 million from $49.4 million. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operating income of $8.3 million, excluding the non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $31.0 million. Our operating income grew from an increase in MasterCraft unit sales volume, price increases, and favorable product mix, partially offset by increased warranty costs and higher discounts related to retaliatory import tariff support for our Canadian and European Union dealers. The inclusion of Crest and NauticStar's incremental fiscal 2019 first quarter also drove the increase in our operating income. These increases were partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes and an increase in cash payments for interest related to the long-term debt used to fund the Crest acquisition.\nOur net cash provided by operating activities increased by $23.2 million, or 88.3%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, to $49.4 million from $26.2 million. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operating income of $22.5 million of which $15.8 million was attributable to our MasterCraft segment. Our MasterCraft segment operating income grew from an increase in unit sales volume, price increases, lower warranty costs and reduced retail rebate activity, partially offset by higher material costs. The inclusion of NauticStar increased our operating income by $6.6 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes and an increase in cash payments for interest related to an increase in our term loan balance when compared to the principal balance owed on our term loan during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $10.0 million for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. This increase was partially due to the acquisition of Crest in October 2018, for cash consideration of $81.0 million, net of cash on hand. Remaining capital outlays consisted of purchases for manufacturing infrastructure and expansion activities, molds, and equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $81.7 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of NauticStar in October 2017, for cash consideration of $80.5 million, net of cash on hand. Remaining capital outlays consisted of purchases for manufacturing infrastructure and expansion activities, molds, and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $2.8 million for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to greater principal repayments on long-term debt in fiscal 2019. Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of principal repayments and debt issuance costs, was $38.0 million and $40.3 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities increased $58.3 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher proceeds from issuance of long-term debt partially offset by higher principal repayments in fiscal 2018. Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of principal repayments and debt issuance costs, was $40.3 million and ($18.0) million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSenior Secured Credit Facility.\nOn October 1, 2018, the Company entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement with a syndicate of certain financial institutions (the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement\u201d). The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement replaced the Company's Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated October 2, 2017. The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement provides the Company with a $190 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $75 million term loan, and an $80 million term loan (together, the Term Loans\u201d), and a $35 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). Proceeds from the $80 million term loan were used to fund the Crest acquisition. The Term Loans will mature and all remaining amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on October 1, 2023.\nThe Fourth Amended Credit Agreement bears interest, at the Company's option, at either the prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.5% to 1.5% or at an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.5% to 2.5%, in each case based on the Company's senior leverage ratio. Based on the Company's senior leverage ratio as of June 30, 2019, the applicable margin for loans accruing interest at the prime rate is 0.75% and the applicable margin for loans accruing interest at LIBOR is 1.75%. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the effective interest rate on borrowings outstanding was 4.48% and 4.28%, respectively.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2019, the Company made $41.3 million of principal repayments on the Term Loans using cash generated from operations. Of this total, $32.7 million represented voluntary prepayments. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company's\nunamortized debt issuance costs related to the Term Loans were $1.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively. These costs are being amortized over the term of the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement.\nAs of June 30, 2019, the Company had no borrowings outstanding on its Revolving Credit Facility and the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $35 million. The Company's unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Revolving Credit Facility was $0.5 million and $0.4 million as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of June 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants under its Fourth Amended Credit Agreement.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements as of June 30, 2019.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of June 30, 2019, the Company's contractual cash obligations were as follows:\n\n (1) See Note 11 - Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's debt. Long-Term Debt Obligations\u201d refers to future cash principal payments. \n (2) Interest payments on variable rate debt instruments were calculated using June 30, 2019 interest rates and holding them constant for the life of the instruments. \n (3) Purchase obligations represent agreements with suppliers and vendors entered into as part of the normal course of business. \n (4) Unrecognized tax benefits of $2.9 million are not reflected in this table because the Company cannot predict when open income tax years will close with completed examinations. See Note 12 - Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nRepurchase Obligations - The Company has reserves to cover potential losses associated with repurchase obligations based on historical experience and current facts and circumstances. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017. An adverse change in retail sales, however, could require us to repurchase repossessed units upon an event of default by any of our dealers, subject in some cases to an annual limitation. See Note 14 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for more information related to our obligations under our floor plan financing agreements.\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding stockholder advisory say-on-pay\u201d votes on executive compensation and stockholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation.\nThe JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can utilize the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, we have irrevocably chosen to opt out of such extended transition period and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for companies that are not emerging growth companies.\u201d\nWe will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least $1.07 billion, (ii) June 30, 2021, which is the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of completion of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.07 billion in non-convertible debt, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer,\u201d as defined under the Exchange Act.\nInflation\nThe market prices of certain materials and components used in manufacturing our products, especially resins that are made with hydrocarbon feedstocks, copper, aluminum, and stainless steel, can be volatile. Historically, however, inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations. Significant increases in inflation, particularly those related to wages and increases in the cost of raw materials, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNew boat buyers often finance their purchases. Inflation typically results in higher interest rates that could translate into an increased cost of boat ownership. Should inflation and increased interest rates occur, prospective consumers may choose to forego or delay their purchases or buy a less expensive boat in the event credit is not available to finance their boat purchases.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nA critical accounting policy\u201d is one which is both important to the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income (loss) to vary significantly from period to period.\nWe believe that the policies listed below involve the greatest degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to understand in order to evaluate fully our financial condition and results of operations. For additional information regarding these policies, see Note 3 - Significant Accounting Policies in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets - The Company does not amortize goodwill and other purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives. All of the Company's goodwill and intangible assets relate to either our MasterCraft, NauticStar, or Crest reporting units (see Note 16 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company's intangible assets with finite lives consist primarily of dealer networks and are carried at their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (see Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill results from the excess of purchase price over the net assets of businesses acquired. All three of the Company's reporting units, which are also the Company's reportable segments, have a goodwill balance.\nThe Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually, at fiscal yearend, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. As part of the annual test, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether the fair values of its reporting units are more likely than not\u201d to be greater than their carrying values. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including the effect of market or industry changes and the reporting units' actual results compared to projected results.\nIf the fair value of a reporting unit does not meet the \"more likely than not\" criteria discussed above, the impairment test for goodwill is a quantitative test. This test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nThe Company calculates the fair value of its reporting units considering both the income approach and market approach. The income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach. Internally forecasted future cash flows, which the Company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions, are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital ( Discount Rate\u201d) developed for each reporting unit. The Discount Rate is developed using market observable inputs, as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporting unit's forecasted performance. Fair value under the market approach is determined for each unit by applying market multiples for comparable public companies to the unit's financial results. The key uncertainties in these calculations are the assumptions used in determining the reporting unit's forecasted future performance, including revenue growth and operating margins, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate, along with selecting representative market multiples.\nAt June 30th of each year, we complete our annual impairment test when there are no other triggers during the year. We conducted a quantitative test at June 30, 2019 for all three reporting segments (reporting units), and as a result, recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $28 million related to the NauticStar reporting unit. This charge is included in Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment on the June 30, 2019 consolidated statement of operations. The impairment was principally a result of a decline, in the fiscal fourth quarter, in the outlook for sales and operating performance relative to our acquisition plan. NauticStar's core segment, the value-brand saltwater fishing boat segment, has experienced a recent slowing in demand, especially for boats less than 24 feet in length, which represent a material percentage of NauticStar's current model mix.\nNo goodwill impairment charges were recorded for the MasterCraft or Crest reporting units. It is possible that the Company's assumptions regarding the key uncertainties in these fair value calculations could change in the near term. If actual results differ from the Company's assumptions regarding the key uncertainties in these fair value calculations, it is possible that one or more of the Company's reporting units could incur goodwill impairment charges in future periods.\nOther Intangible Assets\nThe Company's primary intangible assets are dealer networks and trade names acquired in business combinations. Intangible assets are initially valued using a methodology commensurate with the intended use of the asset. The dealer networks were valued using an income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows from the dealer network through the application of the multi-period excess earnings approach. The fair value of trade names is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, a variation of the income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows. This method assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid to third parties had the Company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. The basis for future sales projections for these methods are based on internal revenue forecasts by reporting unit, which the Company believes represent reasonable market participant assumptions. The future cash flows are discounted using an applicable Discount Rate as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset.\nThe key uncertainties in these fair value calculations, as applicable, are: assumptions used in developing internal revenue growth and customer expense forecasts, assumed customer attrition rates, the selection of an appropriate royalty rate, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate.\nThe costs of amortizable intangible assets, including dealer networks, are recognized over their expected useful lives, approximately ten years for the dealer networks, using the straight-line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset may be impaired. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nDuring the goodwill assessment noted above, we also analyzed indefinite-lived assets, or trade names. As a result of our analysis, we recorded an impairment charge on trade names of $3 million related to the NauticStar reporting unit. This charge was included in Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment on the consolidated statement of operations. No other intangible asset impairment loss was recorded for the MasterCraft or Crest reporting units.\nIncome Taxes-We are subject to income taxes in the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rates, primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance and non-deductible expenses, as further described in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. Our effective tax rate was 20.2%, 24.5% and 37.5% for the fiscal years ended 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such\ndetermination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nRealization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods. If future events cause us to conclude that it is not more likely than not that we will be able to recover the value of our deferred tax assets, we are required to establish a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at that time.\nRevenue Recognition - The Company's revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats, marine parts, and accessories. The Company recognizes revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied and control over promised goods is transferred to a customer. For the majority of sales, this occurs when the product is released to the carrier responsible for transporting it to a customer. The Company typically receives payment within 5 days of shipment. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for a product. The Company offers discounts and sales incentives that include retail promotions, rebates, and floor plan reimbursement costs that are recorded as reductions of revenues in Net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The consideration recognized represents the amount specified in a contract with a customer, net of estimated dealer and retail sales incentives the Company reasonably expects to pay. The estimated liability and reduction in revenue for sales incentives is recorded at the time of sale. The Company estimates the amount of sales incentives based on historical data for specific boat models adjusted for forecasted sales volume, product mix, customer behavior and assumptions concerning market conditions. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible because actual results may differ from these estimates if market conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if dealer achievement or other items vary from historical trends.\nDealer Incentives\nDealer incentives include seasonal discounts, volume commitment rebates and other allowances. Dealer rebate and sales promotion incentives recorded during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, were $11.6 million, $6.4 million, and $5.7 million, respectively. Rebates that apply to boats already in dealer inventory are referred to as retail rebates. Retail rebates recorded during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, were $4.2 million, $1.9 million, and $5.5 million, respectively. Accrued rebates are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nDealers generally have no rights to return unsold boats. Occasionally, the Company may accept returns in limited circumstances and at the Company's discretion under its warranty policy (Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company may be obligated, in the event of default by a dealer, to accept returns of unsold boats under its repurchase commitment to floor financing providers, who are able to obtain such boats through foreclosure. The Company accrues the estimated fair value of this obligation based on the age of inventory currently under floor plan financing and estimated credit quality of dealers holding the inventory.\nFloor Plan Reimbursement Costs\nThe Company participates in various programs whereby it agrees to reimburse its dealers for certain floor plan interest costs incurred by such dealers for limited periods of time, generally ranging up to nine months. Such costs are included as a reduction in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations and totaled $7.5 million, $5.1 million, and $3.7 million for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nShipping and handling costs includes those costs incurred to transport product to customers and internal handling costs, which relate to activities to prepare goods for shipment. The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer as a fulfillment cost. The Company includes shipping and handling costs, including costs billed to customers, in Cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations.\nContract Liabilities\nA contract liability is created when customers prepay for goods prior to the Company transferring those goods to the customer. The contract liability is reduced once control of the goods is transferred to the customer. The difference between the opening and closing\nbalances of the Company's contract liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between the Company's performance and the point at which it receives pre-payment from the customer.\nOther Revenue Recognition Matters\nThe Company has excluded sales and other taxes assessed by a governmental authority in connection with revenue-producing activities from the determination of the transaction price for all contracts. The Company has not adjusted Net sales for the effects of a significant financing component because the period between the transfer of the promised goods and the customer's payment is expected to be one year or less.\nProduct Warranties - The Company offers warranties on the sale of certain products for periods of between one and five years. These warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the consumer. We estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty and record as a liability the amount of such costs at the time the product revenue is recognized. The key uncertainties that affect our estimate for warranty liability include anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as actual claims are determined or as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable.\nRepurchase Agreements - In connection with our dealers' wholesale floor plan financing of boats, we have entered into repurchase agreements with various lending institutions. The repurchase commitment is on an individual unit basis with a term from the date it is financed by the lending institution through payment date by the dealer, generally not exceeding two and a half years. Such agreements are customary in the industry and our exposure to loss under such agreements is limited by the resale value of the inventory which is required to be repurchased. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017.", "item_7_tables": "Table 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended June 30,\n</td>

report:\n\nOverview\n- Fiscal 2019 was a record year with net sales of $466.4 million, up 40.2% over prior year, driven by strong MasterCraft boat sales, the Crest acquisition, and inclusion of NauticStar.\n- Net income declined 46.2% to $21.4 million due to a $31 million non-cash impairment charge at NauticStar related to lower demand outlook, especially for smaller boats.\n\nKey Financial Drivers\n- MasterCraft sales up 17.1% on higher volumes, favorable mix/pricing, offset partially by higher tariff-related discounts. \n- Incremental 9-month Crest sales contribution of $76.6 million.\n- NauticStar sales up slightly with lower volumes offset by extra quarter of ownership.\n- Gross margins down from 27.2% to 24.3% due to NauticStar impairment and higher discounts.  \n- Operating expenses up substantially due to NauticStar impairment and acquisition impacts.\n\nLiquidity/Cash Flows\n- Strong cash from operations of $55.9 million.\n- Investing activities includes $81 million payment, net of cash acquired, for Crest acquisition.  \n- Financing activities fund acquisition with net debt proceeds of $38 million.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n- Key policies around goodwill/intangible assets, income taxes, revenue recognition.  \n- $31 million impairment charge recorded related to NauticStar goodwill and trade name.\n\nIn summary, strong growth driven by acquisitions and MasterCraft performance, offset by deterioration in NauticStar value-boat demand resulting in substantial impairment charge."}
