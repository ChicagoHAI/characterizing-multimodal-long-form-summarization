Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations\nIntroduction\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Management's Discussion) analyzes the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of SJI and its subsidiaries. It also includes management's analysis of past financial results and potential factors that may affect future results, potential future risks and approaches that may be used to manage them. Except where the content clearly indicates otherwise, SJI,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d or our\u201d refers to the holding company or the consolidated entity of SJI and all of its subsidiaries.\nManagement's Discussion is divided into the following two major sections:\n\u2022SJI - This section describes the financial condition and results of operations of SJI and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. It includes discussions of our regulated operations, including SJG, and our non-regulated operations.\n\u2022SJG - This section describes the financial condition and results of operations of SJG, a subsidiary of SJI and separate registrant, which comprises the SJG utility operations segment.\nBoth sections of Management's Discussion - SJI and SJG - are designed to provide an understanding of each company's respective operations and financial performance and should be read in conjunction with each other as well as in conjunction with the respective company's financial statements and the combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUnless otherwise noted, earnings per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis, and are based on weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding.\nOVERVIEW - SJI (or the Company) is an energy services holding company that provides a variety of products and services through the following direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries:\nSJIU\nSJIU was established as a subsidiary of SJI for the purpose of serving as a holding company that owns SJG, ETG and, until its sale, ELK.\nSJG\nSJG, a New Jersey corporation, is an operating public utility company engaged in the purchase, transmission and sale of natural gas for residential, commercial and industrial use. SJG also sells natural gas and pipeline transportation capacity (off-system sales) on a wholesale basis to various customers on the interstate pipeline system and transports natural gas purchased directly from producers or suppliers to their customers. SJG contributed approximately $108.1 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis in 2020.\nSJG's service territory covers approximately 2,500 square miles in the southern part of New Jersey. It includes 113 municipalities throughout Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland and Salem Counties and portions of Burlington, Camden and Gloucester Counties. SJG benefits from its proximity to Philadelphia, PA and Wilmington, DE on the western side of its service territory and the popular shore communities on the eastern side. Continuing expansion of SJG's infrastructure throughout its seven-county region has fueled annual customer growth and creates opportunities for future extension into areas not yet served by natural gas.\nSouthern New Jersey's oceanfront communities continue to experience demand for new single and multifamily homes for both seasonal and year-round living. Demand for existing homes has increased throughout our service territory, in line with national trends. Building expansions in the medical, education, warehouse/distribution, and retail sectors contributed to SJG's growth. At present, SJG serves approximately 80% of households within its territory with natural gas. SJG also serves southern New Jersey's diversified industrial base that includes processors of petroleum and agricultural products; chemical, glass and consumer goods manufacturers; and high technology industrial parks.\nAs of December 31, 2020, SJG served 404,886 residential, commercial and industrial customers in southern New Jersey, compared with 397,090 customers at December 31, 2019. No material part of SJG's business is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers. Gas sales, transportation and capacity release for 2020 amounted to 139.3 MMdts, of which 50.5 MMdts were firm sales and transportation, 1.0 MMdts were interruptible sales and transportation and 87.8 MMdts were off-system sales and capacity release. The breakdown of firm sales and transportation includes 48.1% residential, 22.9% commercial, 19.8% industrial, and 9.2% cogeneration and electric generation. As of December 31, 2020, SJG served 378,103 residential customers, 26,369 commercial customers and 414 industrial customers. This includes 2020 net additions\nof 7,410 residential customers and 386 commercial and industrial customers.\nSJG makes wholesale gas sales to gas marketers for resale and ultimate delivery to end users. These off-system\u201d sales are made possible through the issuance of the FERC Orders No. 547 and 636. Order No. 547 issued a blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing all parties, which are not interstate pipelines, to make FERC jurisdictional gas sales for resale at negotiated rates, while Order No. 636 allowed SJG to deliver gas at delivery points on the interstate pipeline system other than its own city gate stations and release excess pipeline capacity to third parties. During 2020, off-system sales amounted to 14.8 MMdts and capacity release amounted to 73.0 MMdts.\nSupplies of natural gas available to SJG that are in excess of the quantity required by those customers who use gas as their sole source of fuel (firm customers) make possible the sale and transportation of gas on an interruptible basis to commercial and industrial customers whose equipment is capable of using natural gas or other fuels, such as fuel oil and propane. The term interruptible\u201d is used in the sense that deliveries of natural gas may be terminated by SJG at any time if this action is necessary to meet the needs of higher priority customers as described in SJG's tariffs. In 2020, usage by interruptible customers, excluding off-system customers, amounted to 1.0 MMdts, or approximately 1% of the total throughput.\nETG\nOn July 1, 2018, SJI, through its wholly-owned subsidiary SJIU, acquired the assets of ETG and ELK from Pivotal Utility Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of Southern Company Gas. ELK was subsequently sold to a third party on July 31, 2020.\nETG is a regulated natural gas utility which distributes natural gas in seven counties in northern and central New Jersey. ETG serves residential, business and industrial customers, with a service territory that covers the northern part of New Jersey, including municipalities throughout Union, Middlesex, Sussex, Warren, Hunterdon, Morris and Mercer Counties. ETG was founded in 1855 and is based in Union, New Jersey. ETG contributed net income of approximately $47.7 million during 2020.\nETG believes growth exists in the expansion of its Northwestern service territory, the Franklin/Sparta area, and the Hackettstown Interconnect. ETG also serves northern New Jersey's diversified industrial base within its territory with natural gas, which includes pharmaceutical, food and beverage, and transportation industries.\nAs of December 31, 2020, ETG served 301,613 customers in northern and central New Jersey, including 277,852 residential customers, 23,663 commercial customers and 98 industrial customers. As of December 31, 2019, ETG served 297,191 customers. No material part of ETG's business is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers. Gas sales and transportation for 2020 amounted to 47.4 MMdts, of which 41.1 MMdts were firm sales and transportation and 6.3 MMdts were interruptible sales and transportation. The breakdown of firm sales and transportation includes 22.4 MMdts residential, 13.2 MMdts commercial, and 5.5 MMdts industrial.\nSJES\nSJI established SJES as a direct subsidiary for the purpose of serving as a holding company for all of SJI's non-utility businesses. The following businesses are wholly-owned subsidiaries of SJES:\nSJE\nSJE provides services for the acquisition and transportation of electricity for retail end users and markets total energy management services. SJE markets electricity to residential, commercial and industrial customers. Most customers served by SJE are located within New Jersey, northwestern Pennsylvania and New England. In 2020, SJE had a net loss of approximately $1.3 million which reduced SJI's net income on a consolidated basis by such amount.\nSJRG\nSJRG markets natural gas storage, commodity and transportation assets along with fuel management services on a wholesale basis. Customers include energy marketers, electric and gas utilities, power plants and natural gas producers. SJRG's marketing activities occur mainly in the mid-Atlantic, Appalachian and southern regions of the country.\nSJRG also conducts price risk management activities by entering into a variety of physical and financial transactions including forward contracts, swap agreements, option contracts and futures contracts. In 2020, SJRG contributed approximately $25.3 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.\nSJEX\nSJEX owns oil, gas and mineral rights in the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania. SJEX is considered part of SJI's wholesale energy operations. In 2020, SJEX contributed approximately $0.4 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.\nMarina\nMarina develops and operates on-site energy-related projects. There are several businesses under Marina, as discussed below.\nACLE, BCLE, SCLE and SXLE are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Marina, which own and operate landfill gas-to-energy production facilities in Atlantic, Burlington, Salem and Sussex Counties, respectively, located in New Jersey. On June 1, 2020, the BCLE, SCLE, and SXLE landfill gas-to-energy production facilities ceased operations after receiving approval from their respective local governmental authorities to do so.\nMarina owns four LLCs which own and operate rooftop solar generation sites located in New Jersey. All four were acquired in 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nIn 2020, SJI, through Marina, formed the Catamaran joint venture with a third party partner. Catamaran owns 100% of Annadale, of which Marina has a 93% ownership interest. Catamaran was formed for the purpose of developing, owning and operating renewable energy projects, and will support SJI's commitment to clean energy initiatives. Annadale has constructed two fuel cell projects totaling 7.5 MW in Staten Island, New York which began operations in December 2020 (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements).\nAlso in, 2020, the Company sold MTF and ACB for a final sales price of $97.0 million. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. MTF previously provided cooling, heating and emergency power to the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa in Atlantic City, NJ. ACB previously owned and operated a natural gas fueled combined heating, cooling and power facility located in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\nOn June 27, 2018, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Marina, entered into a series of agreements whereby Marina agreed to sell its portfolio of solar energy assets (for this section, the Transaction\u201d) to a third-party buyer. As part of the Transaction, Marina agreed to sell its distributed solar energy projects across New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts and Vermont (for this section, the Projects\u201d), along with the assets comprising the Projects. These sales occurred between 2018-2020. Also in connection with the Transaction, Marina is leasing back from the buyer certain of the Projects that have not yet passed the fifth anniversary of their placed-in-service dates for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The leaseback runs from the date each such project was acquired by the buyer until the later of the first anniversary of the applicable acquisition date and the fifth anniversary of the applicable placed-in-service date of the project. As of December 31, 2020, there are ten projects being leased back from the buyer through the end of 2021, which is the fifth anniversary of their placed-in-service date. The results of these projects being leased back are not material.\nThe Company currently has two projects that are not part of the Transaction and remain owned by Marina. These assets are recorded as held and used in Property, Plant and Equipment on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nIn 2020, Marina contributed approximately $14.9 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.\nSJESP\nSJESP receives commissions on appliance service contracts from a third party. In 2020, SJESP contributed approximately $1.7 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.\nSJEI\nSJEI provides energy procurement and cost reduction services. SJEI includes the following wholly-owned subsidiaries:\nAEP, an aggregator, broker and consultant in the retail energy markets, which was acquired in August 2019.\nEnerConnex, a retail and wholesale broker and consultant that matches end users with suppliers for the procurement of natural gas and electricity, which became 100% owned in 2020 (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements).\nIn 2020, SJEI contributed approximately $0.4 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.\nMidstream\nMidstream owns a 20% equity investment, along with four other investors, in PennEast. In 2020, Midstream contributed approximately $4.2 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.\nOther\nSJI Renewable Energy Ventures, LLC and SJI RNG Devco, LLC are newly formed subsidiaries which hold the equity interest in REV LNG and the renewable natural gas development rights in certain dairy farms, respectively (see Notes 1, 3 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements).\nEMI principally manages liabilities associated with its discontinued operations of nonutility subsidiaries.\nPrimary Factors Affecting SJI's Business\nSJI's current long-term goals are to grow Economic Earnings Per Share 6-8% annually driven by high quality earnings, a strong balance sheet and a low-to-moderate risk profile. Management established those goals in conjunction with SJI's Board of Directors based upon a number of different internal and external factors that characterize and influence SJI's current and expected future activities.\nThe following is a summary of the primary factors we expect to have the greatest impact on SJI's performance and ability to achieve the long-term goals going forward:\nBusiness Model - In developing SJI's current business model, our focus has been on our core Utilities and natural extensions of those businesses, as well as strategic opportunities in our nonutility business that align with the goals of the EMP. That focus enables us to concentrate on business activities that match our core competencies. Going forward we expect to pursue business opportunities that fit and complement this model.\nCustomer Growth - SJG's area of operations is southern New Jersey. Residential new construction activity remains steady, supported by growth in higher density and multi-family units. Customers for SJG grew 2.0% for 2020 as SJG continues its focus on customer conversions. In 2020, the 4,326 consumers converting their homes and businesses from other heating fuels, such as electric, propane or oil, represented approximately 55% of the total new customer acquisitions for the year. Customers in SJG's service territory typically base their decisions to convert on comparisons of fuel costs, environmental considerations and efficiencies. While oil and propane prices have become more competitive with natural gas in the past two years, affecting the number of conversions, SJG began a comprehensive partnership with the State's Office of Clean Energy to educate consumers on energy efficiency and to promote the rebates and incentives available to natural gas users.\nETG's primary area of operations is central and northern NJ, which continues to grow in multifamily housing and gas infrastructure extensions to unserved areas. While ETG continues to partner with builders in the new construction sector with the view of increasing natural gas burner tips, ETG is pursuing conversions throughout its service territory. As a result, customer additions for ETG grew approximately 1.5%. In 2020, consumers converting their homes and businesses from other heating fuels, such as electric, propane or oil, represented approximately 42% of the total new customer acquisitions for the year. Customers in ETG service territories typically base their decisions to convert on fuel cost savings, efficiencies, and fuel stability pricing. ETG leverages its comprehensive partnership with the State's Office of Clean Energy to educate consumers on energy efficiency and to promote the rebates and incentives available to natural gas users.\nRegulatory Environment - SJG and ETG are primarily regulated by the BPU. The BPU approves the rates that are charged to rate-regulated customers for services provided and the terms of service under which the Utilities operate. The rates and established terms of service are designed to enable the Utilities to recover costs of service and obtain a fair and reasonable return on capital invested.\nSJG's BPU approved CIP, along with ETG's BPU approved WNC, protect the Utilities' net income from severe fluctuations in gas used by residential, commercial and small industrial customers.\nSJG's AIRP is a program to replace cast iron and unprotected bare steel mains and services. All AIRP investments are reflected in base rates. Additionally, the BPU issued an Order approving an extension of the AIRP for a five-year period ( AIRP II\u201d), commencing October 1, 2016, with authorized investments of up to $302.5 million to continue replacing cast iron and unprotected bare steel mains and associated services. SJG earns a return on AIRP II investments once they are placed in service and, thereafter, once they are included in rate base, through annual filings. SJG's SHARP is a program to replace low-pressure distribution mains and services with high-pressure mains and services in coastal areas that are susceptible to flooding during major storms. In May 2018, the BPU issued an order approving a second phase of the SHARP (\"SHARP II\") for a three-year period, commencing June 1, 2018, with authorized investments of up to $100.3 million to continue storm hardening efforts to further improve safety, redundancy and resiliency of SJG's natural gas system in coastal areas. Pursuant to the order, SHARP II investments are to be recovered through annual base rate adjustments.\nIn September 2020, the BPU approved the settlement of SJG's rate case petition, resulting in an increase in annual revenues from base rates effective October 1, 2020 of $39.5 million.\nIn September 2020, the BPU approved, on a provisional basis, a $59.4 million decrease in gas cost recoveries, effective October 1, 2020. SJG's BGSS filing included consideration of $22.9 million of costs requested to be recovered over a two-year period related to a previous dispute on a long-term gas supply contract that was settled during 2019. The provisional rate adjustments effective October 1, 2020 include the temporary removal of these amounts to allow for a further review of these costs during the course of this proceeding which we expect to be completed during the second quarter of 2021.\nConsistent with ETG/ELK Acquisition approval, SJI was required to develop a plan, in concert with the BPU and the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel, to address the replacement of ETG's aging infrastructure. In June 2019, the BPU approved a $300.0 million IIP effective July 1, 2019. The Order authorized the recovery of costs associated with ETG's investments of approximately $300.0 million between 2019-2024 to replace its cast-iron and bare steel vintage main and related services. The Order provides for annual recovery of ETG's investments through a separate rate mechanism.\nIn November 2019, the BPU approved the settlement of ETG's rate case petition, resulting in an increase to base rate revenues by $34.0 million with new rates in effect November 15, 2019.\nOn July 2, 2020, the BPU issued an Order authorizing New Jersey's regulated utilities to create a COVID-19-related regulatory asset by deferring on their books and records the prudently incurred incremental costs related to COVID-19 beginning on March 9, 2020 and continuing through September 30, 2021, or 60 days after the termination of the public health emergency, whichever is later. See \"COVID-19\" section below.\nFor more information on the regulatory environments of the Utilities, see Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\nWeather Conditions and Customer Usage Patterns - Usage patterns can be affected by a number of factors, such as wind, precipitation, temperature extremes and customer conservation. SJG's earnings are largely protected from fluctuations in temperatures by the CIP. The CIP has a stabilizing effect on utility earnings as SJG adjusts revenues when actual usage per customer experienced during an annual period varies from an established baseline usage per customer. The WNC rate allows ETG to implement surcharges or credits during the months of October through May to compensate for weather-related changes in customer usage from the previous winter period. The impact of different weather conditions on the earnings of our nonutility businesses is dependent on a range of different factors. Consequently, weather may impact the earnings of SJI's various subsidiaries in different, or even opposite, ways. Further, the profitability of individual subsidiaries may vary from year-to-year despite experiencing substantially similar weather conditions.\nChanges in Natural Gas and Electricity Prices - The Utilities' gas costs are passed on directly to customers without any profit margin added. The price the Utilities charge their periodic customers is set annually, with a regulatory mechanism in place to make limited adjustments to that price during the course of a year. In the event that gas cost increases would justify customer price increases greater than those permitted under the regulatory mechanism, the Utilities can petition the BPU for an incremental rate increase. High prices can make it more difficult for customers to pay their bills and may result in elevated levels of bad debt expense. Among our nonutility activities, the business most likely to be impacted by changes in natural gas prices is our wholesale gas marketing business. Wholesale gas marketing typically benefits from volatility in gas prices during different points in time. The actual price of the commodity does not typically have an impact on the performance of this business line. Our ability to add and retain customers at our retail electric business is affected by the relationship between the price that the utility charges customers for electricity and the cost available in the market at specific points in time. However, retail electric accounts form a very small portion of SJI's overall activities.\nFuel Supply Management - SJRG has acquired pipeline transportation capacity that allows SJRG to match end users, many of which are merchant generators, with producers looking to find a long-term solution for their supply. We currently have nine fuel supply management contracts and expect to continue expanding this business.\nPennEast - Midstream has a 20% investment in PennEast. The PennEast project has been delayed since September 2019 as a result of various court decisions and ongoing appeals. As a result, the Company evaluated its investment in PennEast for other-than-temporary impairment, and at this time, we believe we do not have an other-than-temporary impairment and have not recorded any impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our investment. PennEast management remains committed to pursuing the project and intends to pursue all available options. SJI, along with the other partners, are intending to continue to contribute to the project. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more information, including a timeline of recent events.\nChanges in Interest Rates - SJI has operated in a relatively low interest rate environment over the past several years. Rising interest rates would raise the expense associated with existing variable-rate debt and all issuances of new debt. We have sought to mitigate the impact of a potential rising rate environment by issuing fixed-rate debt. SJG also has derivative transactions to hedge against rising interest rates on its variable-rate debt.\nBalance Sheet Strength - SJI's and SJG's goal is to maintain a strong balance sheet. SJI's average equity-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 33% and 32% as calculated for the four quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. SJG's average equity-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 53% and 51% as calculated for the four quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. A strong balance sheet assists us in maintaining the financial flexibility necessary to take advantage of growth opportunities and to address volatile economic and commodity markets while maintaining a low-to-moderate risk platform.\nLabor and Benefit Costs - Labor and benefit costs have a significant impact on SJI's profitability. Benefit costs, especially those related to pension and health care, have risen in recent years. We seek to manage these costs by revising health care plans offered to existing employees, capping postretirement health care benefits, and changing health care and pension packages offered to new hires. In addition, in 2018, the Company offered an ERIP to non-union, non-Officer employees over the age of 55 years old with 20 or more years of service to the Company as well as to Officers over the age of 55 years old with 5 or more years of service to the Company. In 2020, SJG entered into a VSIP program with IBEW Local 1293 and IAM Local 76 union employees over the age of 60 years old with 10 or more years of service to SJG (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements).\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES - ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS - As described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain types of transactions presented in our consolidated financial statements require a significant amount of judgment and estimation. These relate to regulatory accounting, derivatives, environmental remediation costs, pension and other postretirement benefit costs, revenue recognition, goodwill, evaluation of equity method investments for other-than-temporary impairment, and income taxes.\nRegulatory Accounting (see Notes 10 & 11 to the consolidated financial statements) - The Utilities maintain their accounts according to the Uniform System of Accounts as prescribed by the BPU. As a result of the ratemaking process, the Utilities are required to follow ASC 980, Regulated Operations, which requires them to recognize the impact of regulatory decisions on their financial statements. The Utilities are required under their BGSS clauses to forecast their natural gas costs and customer consumption in setting their rates. Subject to regulator approval, they are able to recover or return the difference between gas cost recoveries and the actual costs of gas through a BGSS charge to customers. The Utilities record any over/under recoveries as a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets and reflect them in the BGSS charge to customers in subsequent years. The Utilities also enter into derivatives that are used to hedge natural gas purchases. The offset to the resulting derivative assets or liabilities is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDerivatives (see Notes 16 & 17 to the consolidated financial statements) - SJI recognizes assets or liabilities for contracts that qualify as derivatives that are entered into by its subsidiaries when such contracts are executed. We record contracts at their fair value in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. We record changes in the fair value of the effective portion of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges, net of tax, in AOCL and recognize such changes in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded in earnings in the current period. Currently we do not have any energy-related derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting has been discontinued for the remaining interest rate derivatives. As a result, unrealized gains and losses on these derivatives, that were previously recorded in AOCL on the consolidated balance sheets, are being recorded into earnings over the remaining life of the derivative.\nCounterparty credit risk and the credit risk of SJI, are incorporated and considered in the valuation of all derivative instruments, as appropriate. The effect of counterparty credit risk and the credit risk of SJI on the derivative valuations is not significant.\nCertain derivatives that result in the physical delivery of the commodity may meet the criteria to be accounted for as normal purchases and normal sales, if so designated, in which case the contract is not marked-to-market, but rather is accounted for when the commodity is delivered. Due to the application of regulatory GAAP, derivatives related to the Utilities' gas purchases that are marked-to-market are recorded through the BGSS. The Utilities periodically enter into financial derivatives to hedge against forward price risk. These derivatives are recorded at fair value with an offset to regulatory assets and liabilities through the BGSS, subject to BPU approval (see Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements). We adjust the fair value of the contracts each reporting period for changes in the market.\nAs discussed in Notes 16 and 17 of the consolidated financial statements, energy-related derivative instruments are traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. Exchange-based contracts are valued using unadjusted quoted market sources in active markets and are categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. Certain non-exchange-based contracts are valued using indicative price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges and are categorized in Level 2. These price quotations reflect the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices and are obtained from sources that management believes provide the most liquid market. Management reviews and corroborates the price quotations with at least one additional source to ensure the prices are observable market information, which includes consideration of actual transaction volumes, market delivery points, bid-ask spreads and contract duration. Derivative instruments that are used to limit our exposure to changes in interest rates on variable-rate, long-term debt are valued using quoted prices on commonly quoted intervals, which are interpolated for periods different than the quoted intervals, as inputs to a market valuation model. Market inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment, as a result, these instruments are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. For non-exchange-based derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs. In instances where observable data is unavailable, management considers the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility and contract duration. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the model inputs generally are not observable.\nManagement uses the discounted cash flow model to value Level 3 physical and financial forward contracts, which calculates mark-to-market valuations based on forward market prices, original transaction prices, volumes, risk-free rate of return and credit spreads. Inputs to the valuation model are reviewed and revised as needed, based on historical information, updated market data, market liquidity and relationships, and changes in third party pricing sources. The validity of the mark-to-market valuations and changes in these values from period to period are examined and qualified against historical expectations by the risk management function. If any discrepancies are identified during this process, the mark-to-market valuations or the market pricing information is evaluated further and adjusted, if necessary.\nLevel 3 valuation methods for natural gas derivative contracts include utilizing another location in close proximity adjusted for certain pipeline charges to derive a basis value. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of certain natural gas contracts consist of forward prices developed based on industry-standard methodologies. Significant increases (decreases) in these forward prices for purchases of natural gas would result in a directionally similar impact to the fair value measurement and for sales of natural gas would result in a directionally opposite impact to the fair value measurement. Level 3 valuation methods for electricity represent the value of the contract marked to the forward wholesale curve, as provided by daily exchange quotes for delivered electricity. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of electric contracts consist of fixed contracted electric load profiles; therefore, no change in unobservable inputs would occur. Unobservable inputs are updated daily using industry-standard techniques. Management reviews and corroborates the price quotations to ensure the prices are observable which includes consideration of actual transaction volumes, market delivery points, bid-ask spreads and contract duration.\nEnvironmental Remediation Costs (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements) - We estimate a range of future costs based on projected investigation and work plans using existing technologies. In preparing consolidated financial statements, SJI records liabilities for future costs using the lower end of the range because a single reliable estimation point is not feasible due to the amount of uncertainty involved in the nature of projected remediation efforts and the long period over which remediation efforts will continue. We update estimates each year to take into account past efforts, changes in work plans, remediation technologies, government regulations and site specific requirements.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Costs (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements) - The costs of providing pension and other postretirement employee benefits are impacted by actual plan experience as well as assumptions of future experience. Employee demographics, plan contributions, investment performance, and assumptions concerning mortality, return on plan assets, discount rates and health care cost trends all have a significant impact on determining our projected benefit obligations. We evaluate these assumptions annually and adjust them accordingly. These adjustments could result in significant changes to the net periodic benefit costs of providing such benefits and the related liabilities recognized by SJI.\nRevenue Recognition (see Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements) - Gas and electricity revenues are recognized in the period the commodity is delivered to customers. All SJI entities bill customers monthly. A majority of customers have their meters read on a cycle basis throughout the month. For retail customers (including SJG) that are not billed at the end of the month, we record an estimate to recognize unbilled revenues for gas/electricity delivered from the date of the last meter reading to the end of the month.\nUtility Revenue\nWe bill SJG and ETG customers at rates approved by the BPU.\nThe BPU allows the Utilities to recover gas costs in rates through the BGSS price structure. The Utilities defer over/under recoveries of gas costs and includes them in subsequent adjustments to the BGSS rate. These adjustments result in over/under recoveries of gas costs being included in rates during future periods. As a result of these deferrals, utility revenue recognition does not directly translate to profitability. While the Utilities realize profits on gas sales during the month of providing the utility service, significant shifts in revenue recognition may result from the various recovery clauses approved by the BPU. This revenue recognition process does not shift earnings between periods, as these clauses only provide for cost recovery on a dollar-for-dollar basis (see Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements).\nThe Utilities' unbilled revenue for natural gas is estimated each month based on monthly deliveries into the system; unaccounted for natural gas based on historical results; customer-specific use factors, when available; actual temperatures during the period; and applicable customer rates.\nThe Utilities also have revenues that arise from alternative revenue programs, which are discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.\nFor the Utilities, unrealized gains and losses on energy-related derivative instruments are recorded in Regulatory Assets or Regulatory Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets of SJI and SJG until they become realized, in which case they are recognized in operating revenues.\nNonutility Revenue\nSJE and SJRG customers are billed at rates negotiated between the parties.\nSJRG's gas revenues are recognized in the period the commodity is delivered. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on energy-related derivative instruments are also recognized in operating revenues for SJRG. SJRG presents revenues and expenses related to its energy trading activities on a net basis in Operating Revenues - Nonutility in the statements of consolidated income consistent with GAAP. This net presentation has no effect on operating income or net income.\nThe Company recognizes revenues on commissions received related to SJESP appliance service contracts, along with AEP and ECX energy procurement service contracts from a third party, on a monthly basis as the commissions are earned.\nMarina recognizes revenue for renewable energy projects when output is generated and delivered to the customer, and when renewable energy credits have been transferred to the third party at an agreed upon price.\nGoodwill (see Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements) - The segments that have goodwill are ETG Utility Operations and Corporate & Services. Goodwill represents future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration paid or transferred over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount.\nThe Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year beginning with a qualitative assessment at the reporting unit level. The reporting unit level is identified by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available, whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components and whether the economic and regulatory characteristics are similar. Factors utilized in the qualitative analysis performed on goodwill in our reporting units include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, company specific operating results and other relevant entity-specific events affecting individual reporting units.\nIf sufficient qualitative factors exist, potential goodwill impairment is evaluated quantitatively. Potential impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the book value, including goodwill. The Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis. Management also considers other methods, which includes a market multiples analysis. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, discount and growth rates, capital expenditures, tax rates, and projected terminal values.\nChanges in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. If the fair value exceeds book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the book value exceeds fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess up until the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2019, certain qualitative factors were present that required the Company to perform a quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment at March 31, 2020 related to the ETG reporting unit. The qualitative factors primarily included macroeconomic conditions related to COVID-19. During the third quarter of 2020, due to a decline in market conditions for gas distributors and our performance relative to the overall sector, the Company determined it necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment as of September 30, 2020 related to the ETG reporting unit. There were no impairments recorded as a result of either interim impairment test. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn preparing the goodwill impairment tests, the fair value of the reporting unit was calculated using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, capital expenditures, tax rates, projected terminal values and assumptions related to discount and growth rates, and implied market multiples for a selected group of peer companies. Based on the analysis performed, the fair value of the ETG reporting unit closely approached, but exceeded, its carrying amount. Should economic conditions deteriorate in future periods or remain depressed for a prolonged period of time, estimates of future cash flows and market valuation assumptions may not be sufficient to support the carrying value, requiring impairment charges in the future.\nEvaluation of Equity Method Investments for Other-Than-Temporary Impairment (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) - Our evaluation of impairment of equity method investments when conditions exist that could indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than book value includes key inputs that involve significant management judgments and estimates, including projections of the investment's cash flows, selection of a discount rate and probability weighting of potential outcomes of legal and regulatory proceedings and other available options.\nAs a result of the September 2019 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals and continuing events (see \"PennEast\" above), we evaluated our investment in the PennEast project for an other-than-temporary impairment. Our impairment assessment used a discounted cash flow income approach, including consideration of the severity and duration of any decline in fair value of our investment in the project. Our significant estimates and assumptions included development options and legal outcomes, construction costs, timing of in-service dates (which have been delayed from the initial timing assumed in our analysis as of December 31, 2019), revenues (including forecasted volumes and rates), and discount rates. At this time, we believe that we do not have an other-than-temporary impairment and have not recorded any impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our investment.\nOur evaluation also considered the current economic conditions as a result of COVID-19, noting that the timelines, potential options and legal proceedings have not been impacted. However, the legal and regulatory proceedings could have unfavorable outcomes, or there could be other future unfavorable developments, such as a reduced likelihood of success from development options and legal outcomes, estimated increases in construction costs, increases in the discount rate, or further significant delays, or PennEast could conclude that the project is not viable or does not go forward as actions progress. These could impact our conclusions with respect to other-than-temporary impairment and may require that we recognize an impairment charge of up to our recorded investment in the project, net of any cash and working capital.\nWe will continue to monitor and update this analysis as required. Different assumptions could affect the timing and amount of any charge recorded in a period.\nIncome Taxes - The determination of SJI's and SJG's provision for income taxes requires the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of tax laws. Judgment is required in assessing the deductibility and recoverability of certain tax benefits. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the Company's deferred tax assets will not be realized. Any significant changes to the estimates and judgments with respect to the interpretations, timing or deductibility could result in a material change to earnings and cash flows. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCOVID-19 - In March 2020, the World Health Organization classified the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic. The rapid spread has resulted in worldwide shutdowns and the halting of business and personal activity as governments around the world imposed regulations to control the spread of COVID-19. As a result, the global economy has been marked by significant slowdowns and uncertainty.\nOur business operations continue to function effectively during the pandemic. We are continuously evaluating the global pandemic and are taking necessary steps to mitigate known risks. We continue to closely monitor developments related to the pandemic and will adjust our actions and operations as appropriate in order to continue to provide safe and reliable service to our customers and communities while keeping employees safe. Although the impact to the operations of SJI and SJG has been minimal to date as discussed below, given the pandemic remains prevalent and the situation is evolving, the future impact on the business of SJI and SJG besides what is noted below is unknown. SJI and SJG provide critical and essential services to our customers and the health and safety of our employees and customers is our first priority. SJI and SJG considered the impact of COVID-19 on the use of estimates and assumptions used for financial reporting and noted there were no material impacts on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, as operations and delivery of product to our customers has not been materially impacted. To date, SJI has not experienced significant reductions in sales volumes across our businesses, and we do not anticipate any significant reductions in sales volumes going forward.\nSJI has been actively addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and has established a task force comprised of members of management, with the mission of ensuring the safety of individuals (customers and employees), while continuing to perform our daily responsibilities in an efficient and safe manner. SJI is following the guidance from federal, state and local authorities to help safeguard the health, safety and well-being of its employees. To date, all of our employees are currently working. The task force identified which roles are essential (i.e. need to work in field/office to conduct daily activities) and non-essential (i.e. able to perform work from a remote location) and developed a plan for all employees in non-essential roles to work remotely from home while ensuring that the appropriate safety measures are in place for all employees in essential roles in the field/office. These plans remain in place, as all employees in non-essential roles continue to work remotely. For employees in essential roles, safety measures include additional personal protective equipment and adjusting shifts to reduce the number of workers in close contact. Given the additional safety measures in place, and the ability for employees in non-essential roles to work remotely, we have not had a material impact on our operations as a result of these human capital constraints, and we do not believe operations will be materially impacted going forward by human capital constraints.\nIn order to initiate the business continuity plan, the Company has incurred operating costs for emergency supplies, cleaning services, enabling technology and other specific needs during the pandemic. SJI has incurred costs during 2020 of $2.2 million, with $0.6 million being recorded as Property, Plant & Equipment on the consolidated balance sheets, and the remaining $1.6 million recorded as Operations Expense on the consolidated statements of income. SJG has recorded $0.2 million of such costs, which are recorded as Property, Plant & Equipment on the balance sheets. Going forward, we expect further expenses for the above mentioned items; however, we do not anticipate these additional expenses to be material.\nThe supply chain has not been materially impacted by COVID-19; this is because the Company has a large inventory of standard products such as pipe material. In addition, given that the products are considered essential products, factories are remaining open, therefore allowing materials to be replenished. The Company is actively managing the materials, supplies and contract services necessary for our operations, and does not expect a disruption to the Company's gas supply in the future.\nOur infrastructure investment programs to replace and upgrade critical utility infrastructure continue to move forward. As a result of COVID-19, certain construction activity had been delayed due to some activity being ceased in accordance with directives from the Governor of New Jersey earlier in 2020. Construction activity has since resumed given the directive from the Governor was lifted. Our infrastructure investment programs continue to move forward; however, to the extent the pandemic worsens or a similar directive is put in place in the future for a long period of time, our capital projects could be significantly impacted.\nWe have considered the impact of COVID-19 on the liquidity position of the Company, and note that it has remained stable throughout this uncertain period, and that SJI's and SJG's ability to borrow has not been materially impacted to date. Further, SJI and SJG have successfully paid off and refinanced debt, and raised equity through the ATM offering, during 2020. In addition, SJI has continued to pay its quarterly dividend throughout 2020. See Liquidity and Capital resources section for a detailed description of borrowings entered into during the period.\nWe considered the impact the pandemic has had on operating revenues, noting that SJI and SJG have not seen a significant reduction in revenues as a result of the pandemic. This is due to gas and electricity being considered an essential service and continuing to be delivered timely to customers, and no delays or operational shutdowns taking place to date. Given the performance obligation is satisfied at delivery, which matches the time when the Company is able to invoice the customer, the Company is confident in being able to meet its future performance obligations. To the extent that the pandemic does impact our ability to deliver in the future, operating revenues could be impacted.\nAll accounts receivables are carried at the amount owed by customers. The provision for uncollectible accounts is established based on expected credit losses. On July 2, 2020, the BPU issued an Order authorizing New Jersey's regulated utilities to create a COVID-19-related regulatory asset by deferring on their books and records the prudently incurred incremental costs related to COVID-19 beginning on March 9, 2020 and continuing through September 30, 2021, or 60 days after the termination of the public health emergency, whichever is later. The Company will be required to file quarterly reports with the BPU, along with a petition for recovery of such incremental costs with the BPU by December 31, 2021 or within 60 days of the close of the tracking period, whichever is later. During the year ended December 31, 2020, ETG deferred $6.1 million and SJG deferred $4.8 million of incremental costs principally related to expected credit losses from uncollectibles as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically related to changes in payment patterns observed to date and consideration of macroeconomic factors. We have deemed these costs to be probable of recovery (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). The Utilities have suspended disconnects for nonpayment by our customers, based on orders and requests from our various regulators. These suspensions will go through at least March 15, 2021 based on an executive order issued by the Governor of New Jersey, in which water, gas and electricity providers are barred from cutting services to New Jersey residents.\nGiven the impact that COVID-19 has had on the economy, on March 27, 2020 the President signed into law the CARES Act, an economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, as a way to provide relief to both businesses and individuals affected by the virus. The CARES Act contains several corporate tax provisions that impacted SJI and SJG, including deferring payments on social security taxes for employees and other employee retention credits. These impacts of the CARES Act, and these provisions, did not have a material effect on income tax expense or deferred tax assets/liabilities.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting macroeconomic market conditions, the Company determined it necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis on the goodwill at the ETG reporting unit as of March 31, 2020, and again as of September 30, 2020. There were no impairments recorded as a result of either interim impairment test. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, along with \"Goodwill\" above.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - See discussions concerning New Accounting Pronouncements and their impact on SJI in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRATES AND REGULATION - The Utilities are subject to regulation by the BPU. Additionally, the Natural Gas Policy Act contains provisions for Federal regulation of certain aspects of the Utilities' business. The Utilities are affected by Federal regulation with respect to transportation and pricing policies applicable to pipeline capacity from Transco (both utilities' major supplier), Columbia and Dominion, since such services are provided under rates and terms established under the jurisdiction of the FERC. The Utilities' retail sales are made under rate schedules within a tariff filed with, and subject to the jurisdiction of, the BPU. These rate schedules provide primarily for either block rates or demand/commodity rate structures. The Utilities' primary rate mechanisms include base rates, the BGSS, Accelerated Infrastructure Programs, EET and the CIP for SJG, and BGSS and WNC for ETG.\nThe CIP is a BPU-approved program that is designed to eliminate the link between SJG profits and the quantity of natural gas SJG sells, and to foster conservation efforts. With the CIP, SJG's profits are tied to the number of customers served and how efficiently SJG serves them, thus allowing SJG to focus on encouraging conservation and energy efficiency among its customers without negatively impacting net income. The CIP tracking mechanism adjusts revenue based on weather, and also adjusts SJG's revenue when actual usage per customer experienced during an annual period varies from an established baseline usage per customer.\nEach CIP year begins October 1 and ends September 30 of the subsequent year. On a monthly basis during a CIP year, SJG records adjustments to revenue based on weather and customer usage factors, as incurred. Subsequent to each year, SJG makes filings with the BPU to review and approve amounts recorded under the CIP. BPU-approved cash inflows or outflows generally will not begin until the next CIP year and have no impact on revenue at that time.\nUtility revenue is recognized during current periods based upon the application of the CIP. The cash impact of variations in customer usage will result in cash being collected from, or returned to, customers during the subsequent CIP year, which runs from October 1 to September 30.\nThe effects of the CIP on SJG's net income for the last three years and the associated weather comparisons were as follows (in millions):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td>2019 </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income Impact: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CIP - Weather Related </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CIP - Usage Related </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.2) </td> <td> </td> <td>7.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Net Income Impact </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.6) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weather Compared to 20-Year Average </td> <td>12.5% warmer </td> <td>5.2% warmer </td> <td>183.0% colder </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weather Compared to Prior Year </td> <td>8.4% warmer </td> <td>2.6% warmer </td> <td>7.7% colder </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs part of the CIP, SJG is required to implement additional conservation programs, including customized customer communication and outreach efforts, targeted upgrade furnace efficiency packages, financing offers, and an outreach program to speak to local and state institutional constituents. SJG is also required to reduce gas supply and storage assets and their associated fees. Note that changes in fees associated with supply and storage assets have no effect on SJG's net income as these costs are passed through directly to customers on a dollar-for-dollar basis.\nEarnings accrued and payments received under the CIP are limited to a level that will not cause SJG's return on equity to exceed 9.6% (excluding earnings from off-system gas sales and certain other tariff clauses) and CIP recoveries are limited by the annualized savings attained from reducing gas supply and storage assets.\nFor ETG, the WNC is a BPU-approved program that is designed to recover or refund balances associated with differences between actual and normal weather during the preceding winter period(s). The effective winter period of the WNC is defined as October through May.\nIn 2020, ETG's net income was increased by $10.2 million, primarily due to warmer than average weather for the applicable months in the 2020 winter period. In 2019, ETG's net income was reduced by $5.9 million, primarily due to colder than average weather for the applicable months in the 2019 winter period.\nSee additional discussions on Rates and Regulatory Actions in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.\nENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION - See discussion concerning Environmental Remediation in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCOMPETITION - The Utilities' franchises are non-exclusive. Currently, no other utility provides retail gas distribution services within the Utilities territories, and we do not expect any other utilities to do so in the foreseeable future because of the extensive investment required for utility plant and related costs. The Utilities compete with oil, propane and electricity suppliers for residential, commercial and industrial users, with alternative fuel source providers (wind, solar and fuel cells) based upon price, convenience and environmental factors, and with other marketers/brokers in the selling of wholesale natural gas services. The market for natural gas commodity sales is subject to competition due to deregulation. SJG's competitive position was enhanced while maintaining margins by using an unbundled tariff. This tariff allows full cost-of-service recovery when transporting gas for SJG's customers. Under this tariff, SJG profits from transporting, rather than selling, the commodity. SJG's residential, commercial and industrial customers can choose their supplier, while SJG recovers the cost of service through transportation service (See Customer Choice Legislation below).\nSJRG competes in the wholesale natural gas market against a wide array of competitors on a cost competitive, term of service, and reliability basis. SJRG has been a reliable energy provider in this arena for more than 20 years.\nMarina competes with other companies that develop and operate similar types of on-site energy production. Marina also faces competition from customers' preferences for alternative technologies for energy production, as well as those customers that address their energy needs internally.\nCUSTOMER CHOICE LEGISLATION - All residential natural gas customers in New Jersey can choose their natural gas commodity supplier under the terms of the Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act of 1999.\" This bill created the framework and necessary time schedules for the restructuring of the state's electric and natural gas utilities. The Act established unbundling, where redesigned utility rate structures allow natural gas and electric consumers to choose their energy supplier. It also established time frames for instituting competitive services for customer account functions and for determining whether basic gas supply services should become competitive. Customers purchasing natural gas from a provider other than the local utility (the marketer\u201d) are charged for the gas costs by the marketer and charged for the transportation costs by the utility. The total number of customers in SJG's service territory purchasing natural gas from a marketer averaged 21,089, 22,216 and 25,665 during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The total number of customers in ETG's service territory purchasing natural gas from a marketer averaged 9,179 and 8,338 during 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS:\nFor information on the changes in results of operations from 2019 compared to 2018, refer to the Management Discussion & Analysis section in Item 7 of SJI's and SJG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSJI operates in several different reportable operating segments. These segments are as follows:\n\u2022SJG utility operations consist primarily of natural gas distribution to residential, commercial and industrial customers in southern New Jersey.\n\u2022ETG utility operations consist primarily of natural gas distribution to residential, commercial and industrial customers in northern and central New Jersey.\n\u2022ELK utility operations consist of natural gas distribution to residential, commercial and industrial customers in Maryland. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, on July 31, 2020, SJI sold ELK to a third-party buyer.\n\u2022Wholesale energy operations include the activities of SJRG and SJEX.\n\u2022Retail gas and other operations at SJE included natural gas acquisition and transportation service business lines. This business was sold on November 30, 2018 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022Retail electric operations at SJE consist of electricity acquisition and transportation to commercial, industrial and residential customers.\n\u2022On-site energy production consists of MTF and ACB, which were sold on February 18, 2020. This segment also includes other energy-related projects, including three legacy solar projects, one of which was sold during the first quarter of 2020. Also included in this segment are the activities of ACLE, BCLE, SCLE and SXLE. Operations at BCLE, SCLE, and SXLE ceased during the second quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, on-site energy production also includes newly acquired entities which own and operate solar-generation sites located in New Jersey, as well as the Catamaran joint venture, which owns Annadale (see Notes 1 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022Appliance service operations includes SJESP, which receives commissions on appliance service contracts from a third party.\n\u2022Midstream was formed to invest in infrastructure and other midstream projects, including an investment in PennEast.\n\u2022Corporate & Services segment includes costs related to acquisitions and divestitures, along with other unallocated costs. Also included in this segment are the results of SJEI and the assets related to our transactions with REV LNG (see Notes 3 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022Intersegment represents intercompany transactions among the above SJI consolidated entities.\nSJI groups its utility businesses under its wholly-owned subsidiary SJIU. This group consists of gas utility operations of SJG and ETG and, until its sale, ELK. SJI groups its nonutility operations into separate categories: Energy Group, Energy Services, Midstream and Corporate & Services. Energy Group includes wholesale energy, retail electric and, until its sale, retail gas and other operations. Energy Services includes on-site energy production and appliance service operations. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nSJI's net income for 2020 increased $80.1 million to $157.0 million compared to 2019. SJI's income from continuing operations for 2020 increased $80.1 million to $157.3 million compared to 2019. The significant drivers for the overall changes were as follows (all numbers in the bullet points below are presented after-tax):\n\u2022The income contribution from on-site energy production at Marina increased $24.0 million to $14.9 million, primarily due to ITC recorded on assets of recently acquired fuel cell and solar projects as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, along with the impact of impairment charges taken in 2019 that did not recur in 2020. These were partially offset with depreciation recorded on solar projects previously held for sale and the impact of less earnings from MTF/ACB due to its sale in February 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements)\n\u2022The income contribution from the wholesale energy operations at SJRG increased $23.9 million to $25.3 million, primarily due to higher margins on daily energy trading activities, along with a refund received from a third party supplier as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Also contributing to the increase was the change in unrealized gains and losses on forward financial contracts due to price volatility.\n\u2022The income contribution from gas utility operations at SJG increased $20.7 million to $108.1 million, primarily due to an increase in base rates as the BPU approved the settlement of SJG's rate case petition in September 2020 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), along with customer growth and the roll-in to rates of infrastructure program investments. SJG's utility margin also increased from its CIP mechanism as discussed in \"Utility Margin - SJG Utility Operations\" below. These were partially offset with increases in depreciation and maintenance expenses, along with a one-time tax adjustment resulting from SJG's Stipulation of Settlement with the BPU as part of its recent filing (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022The income contribution from the gas utility operations at ETG increased $13.5 million to $47.7 million, primarily due to positive margins due to favorable changes in base rates resulting from the completion of ETG's rate case in November 2019 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), along with customer growth and lower maintenance expenses. This was partially offset with higher operations and depreciation expenses.\n\u2022SJI incurred $2.5 million less severance and other employee separation costs during 2020 compared to 2019.\n\u2022Partially offsetting the above are items including:\n\u25e6Various tax items, most notably a state deferred tax valuation allowance (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u25e6A net increase in financing and interest costs at the SJI level (i.e. excluding SJG and ETG, as these are included in the income contributions noted above) during 2020 compared to 2019. These increases were primarily due to interest incurred on higher amounts of long-term debt outstanding, along with expenses incurred to terminate SJI's interest rate swaps (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). These increased costs were partially offset by changes in the mark-to-market valuations of SJI's interest rate swaps prior to termination in 2020.\nA significant portion of the volatility in operating results is due to the impact of the accounting methods associated with SJI's derivative activities. SJI uses derivatives to limit its exposure to market risk on transactions to buy, sell, transport and store natural gas and to buy and sell retail electricity. SJI also uses derivatives to limit its exposure to increasing interest rates on variable-rate debt.\nThe types of transactions that typically cause the most significant volatility in operating results are as follows:\n\u2022 The wholesale energy operations at SJRG purchases and holds natural gas in storage and maintains capacity on interstate pipelines to earn profit margins in the future. The wholesale energy operations utilize derivatives to mitigate price risk in order to substantially lock-in the profit margin that will ultimately be realized. However, both gas stored in inventory and pipeline capacity are not considered derivatives and are not subject to fair value accounting. Conversely, the derivatives used to reduce the risk associated with a change in the value of inventory and pipeline capacity are accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in operating results in the period of change. As a result, earnings are subject to volatility as the market price of derivatives change, even when the underlying hedged value of inventory and pipeline capacity are unchanged. Additionally, volatility in earnings is created when realized gains and losses on derivatives used to mitigate commodity price risk on expected future purchases of gas injected into storage are recognized in earnings when the derivatives settle, but the cost of the related gas in storage is not recognized in earnings until the period of withdrawal. This volatility can be significant from period to period.\nOver time, gains or losses on the sale of gas in storage, as well as use of capacity, will be offset by losses or gains on the derivatives, resulting in the realization of the profit margin expected when the transactions were initiated.\n\u2022 The retail electric operations at SJE use forward contracts to mitigate commodity price risk on fixed price electric contracts with customers. In accordance with GAAP, the forward contracts are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings in the period of change. Several related customer contracts are not considered derivatives and, therefore, are not recorded in earnings until the electricity is delivered. As a result, earnings are subject to volatility as the market price of the forward contracts change, even when the underlying hedged value of the customer contract is unchanged. Over time, gains or losses on the sale of the fixed price electric under contract will be offset by losses or gains on the forward contracts, resulting in the realization of the profit margin expected when the transactions were initiated.\nAs a result, management also uses the non-GAAP financial measures of Economic Earnings and Economic Earnings Per Share when evaluating its results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP measures, such as net income, operating income, earnings per share from continuing operations or any other GAAP measure of financial performance.\nWe define Economic Earnings as: Income from Continuing Operations, (i) less the change in unrealized gains and plus the change in unrealized losses on non-utility derivative transactions; (ii) less income and plus losses attributable to noncontrolling interest; and (iii) less the impact of transactions, contractual arrangements or other events where management believes period to period comparisons of SJI's operations could be difficult or potentially confusing. With respect to part (iii) of the definition of Economic Earnings, items excluded from Economic Earnings for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, include impairment charges; the impact of pricing disputes with third parties; costs to acquire ETG and ELK; costs incurred and gains recognized on the acquisitions of Annadale (fuel cell projects) and EnerConnex; costs to prepare to exit the transaction service agreement (TSA); costs incurred and gains/losses recognized on sales of solar, MTF/ACB, ELK and SJE's retail gas business; costs incurred to cease operations at three landfill gas-to-energy production facilities; customer credits related to the acquisition of ETG and ELK; ERIP costs; severance and other employee separation costs; and additional tax adjustments including a state deferred valuation allowance and a one-time tax expense resulting from SJG's Stipulation of Settlement with the BPU. See (A)-(H) in the table below.\nEconomic Earnings is a significant financial measure used by our management to indicate the amount and timing of income from continuing operations that we expect to earn after taking into account the impact of derivative instruments on the related transactions, as well as the impact of contractual arrangements and other events that management believes make period to period comparisons of SJI's operations difficult or potentially confusing. Management uses Economic Earnings to manage its business and to determine such items as incentive/compensation arrangements and allocation of resources. Specifically regarding derivatives, we believe that this financial measure indicates to investors the profitability of the entire derivative-related transaction and not just the portion that is subject to mark-to-market valuation under GAAP. We believe that considering only the change in market value on the derivative side of the transaction can produce a false sense as to the ultimate profitability of the total transaction as no change in value is reflected for the non-derivative portion of the transaction.\nEconomic Earnings for 2020 increased $59.9 million, or 58.2%, to $163.0 million compared to 2019. The significant drivers for the overall change were as follows (all numbers in the bullet points below are presented after-tax):\n\u2022The Economic Earnings contribution from gas utility operations at SJG increased $21.9 million to $109.3 million, primarily due to an increase in base rates as the BPU approved the settlement of SJG's rate case petition in September 2020 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), along with customer growth and the roll-in to rates of infrastructure program investments. SJG's utility margin also increased from its CIP mechanism as discussed in \"Utility Margin - SJG Utility Operations\" below. These were partially offset with increases in depreciation and maintenance expenses,\n\u2022The Economic Earnings contribution from on-site energy production at Marina increased $18.1 million to $15.7 million, primarily due to ITC recorded on assets of recently acquired fuel cell and solar projects as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. These were partially offset with depreciation recorded on solar projects previously held for sale and the impact of less earnings from MTF/ACB due to its sale in February 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022The Economic Earnings contribution from the wholesale energy operations at SJRG increased $16.0 million to $24.8 million, primarily due to higher margins on daily energy trading activities, along with a refund received from a third party supplier as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022The Economic Earnings contribution from gas utility operations at ETG increased $13.5 million to $47.7 million, primarily due to positive margins due to favorable changes in base rates resulting from the completion of ETG's rate case in November 2019 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), along with customer growth and lower maintenance expenses. This was partially offset with higher operations and depreciation expenses.\n\u2022Partially offsetting the above items is a $7.3 million increase in financing and interest costs at the SJI level (i.e. excluding SJG and ETG, as these are included in the Economic Earnings contributions noted above) during 2020 compared to 2019. These were primarily due to interest incurred on higher amounts of long-term debt outstanding, along with expenses incurred to terminate SJI's interest rate swaps (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our income from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations to Economic Earnings and Economic

Interest Charges on the consolidated statements of income.\n(B) Represents pass-through expenses for which there is a corresponding credit in operating revenues. Therefore, such recoveries have no impact on SJG's financial results.\n(C) Utility Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure and is further defined under the caption \"Utility Margin - SJG Utility Operations\" below.\nOperating Revenues - SJG Utility Operations 2020 vs. 2019 - Revenues increased $2.6 million, or 0.4%, during 2020 compared with 2019. Excluding intercompany transactions, revenues increased $0.5 million, or 0.1%, during 2020 compared with 2019.\nThe main driver for the increased revenue was higher firm sales primarily due to customer growth and increase in base rates, partially offset by warmer weather in the first quarter of 2020. While changes in gas costs and BGSS recoveries/refunds fluctuate from period to period, SJG does not profit from the sale of the commodity. Therefore, corresponding fluctuations in Operating Revenue or Cost of Sales have no impact on profitability, as further discussed below under the caption \"Utility Margin.\"\nPartially offsetting these increases was the impact of decreased OSS, which was primarily due to lower commodity costs as a result of lower cash market prices and lower demand, along with warmer weather during the first quarter of 2020. However, the impact of changes in OSS and capacity release activity do not have a material impact on the earnings of SJG, as SJG is required to return the majority of the profits of such activity to its ratepayers.\nUtility Margin - SJG Utility Operations 2020 vs. 2019 - Management uses Utility Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, when evaluating the operating results of SJG. Utility Margin is defined as natural gas revenues plus depreciation and amortization expenses, less natural gas costs, regulatory rider expenses and related volumetric and revenue-based energy taxes. Management believes that Utility Margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than revenues since natural gas costs, regulatory rider expenses and related energy taxes are passed through to customers, and since depreciation and amortization expenses are considered to be administrative. Natural gas costs are charged to operating expenses on the basis of therm sales at the prices approved by the BPU through SJG's BGSS clause. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP measure.\nUtility Margin increased $30.2 million, or 9.5 %, during 2020 compared with 2019. The twelve-month comparative period increase is primarily due to increases in base rates as the BPU approved the settlement of SJG's rate case petition in September 2020 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), along with customer growth and the roll-in to rates of infrastructure program investments Also contributing to the comparative period increase was the CIP tracking mechanism, which adjusts earnings when actual usage per customer experienced during the period varies from an established baseline usage per customer. As reflected in the Utility Margin table above, the CIP mechanism increased Utility Margin in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to variation in customer usage compared to the prior year.\nETG Utility Operations:\nThe following tables summarize the composition of regulated natural gas utility operations, operating revenues and margin at ETG for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and for the post-acquisition period during 2018, which was July 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 (\"post-acquisition period\") (in thousands, except for degree day data):\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utility Operating Revenues: </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020 </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019 </td> <td>July 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Firm & Interruptible Sales - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential </td> <td>$ </td> <td>229,188 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>211,639 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,215 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial & Industrial </td> <td>73,712 </td> <td> </td> <td>66,769 </td> <td> </td> <td>26,784 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Firm & Interruptible Transportation - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential </td> <td>1,654 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,632 </td> <td> </td> <td>508 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial & Industrial </td> <td>43,229 </td> <td> </td> <td>34,846 </td> <td> </td> <td>15,148 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>1,610 </td> <td> </td> <td>10,242 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,949 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Firm & Interruptible Revenues </td> <td>349,393 </td> <td> </td> <td>325,128 </td> <td> </td> <td>125,604 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Total Cost of Sales - Utility (Excluding Depreciation & Amortization) (A) </td> <td>120,798 </td> <td> </td> <td>141,269 </td> <td> </td> <td>53,491 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Depreciation & Amortization (A) </td> <td>56,772 </td> <td> </td> <td>29,051 </td> <td> </td> <td>13,580 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total GAAP Gross Margin </td> <td>171,823 </td> <td> </td> <td>154,808 </td> <td> </td> <td>58,533 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Depreciation & Amortization (A) </td> <td>56,772 </td> <td> </td> <td>29,051 </td> <td> </td> <td>13,580 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Regulatory Rider Expenses (B) </td> <td>16,204 </td> <td> </td> <td>7,989 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,068 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utility Margin (C) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>212,391 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>175,870 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,045 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utility Margin: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,230 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>110,519 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,293 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial & Industrial </td> <td>86,851 </td> <td> </td> <td>63,605 </td> <td> </td> <td>26,034 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory Rider Expenses (B) </td> <td>(13,690) </td> <td> </td> <td>1,746 </td> <td> </td> <td>718 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utility Margin (C) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>212,391 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>175,870 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,045 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Degree Days </td> <td>4,191 </td> <td>4,672 </td> <td>1,724 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(A) Does not include amortization of debt issuance costs that are recorded as Interest Charges on the consolidated statements of income.\n(B) Represents pass-through expenses for which there is a corresponding credit in operating revenues. Therefore, such recoveries have no impact on ETG's financial results.\n(C) Utility Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure and is further defined under the caption \"Utility Margin - SJG Utility Operations\" above. The definition of Utility Margin is the same for each of the Utilities.\nETG consists of natural gas distribution to residential, commercial and industrial customers in northern and central New Jersey. ETG's operating revenues consist of firm sales and transportation, as well as interruptible sales and transportation. ETG does not have any off-system sales. The Utility Margin at ETG is considered a non-GAAP measure and calculated the same as SJG as discussed under \"Utility Margin\" above.\nRevenues from the gas utility operations at ETG increased $24.3 million, or 7.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. ETG Utility Margin increased $36.5 million, or 20.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. These increases in revenues and Utility Margin compared to the prior year periods are primarily due to favorable changes in base rates resulting from the completion of ETG's rate case in November 2019, along with customer growth.\nELK Utility Operations - The activities of ELK utility operations are not material to SJI's financial results. On July 31, 2020, SJI, through its wholly-owned subsidiary SJIU, closed on its transaction to sell ELK to a third-party buyer. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Revenues - Energy Group 2020 vs. 2019 - Combined revenues for Energy Group, net of intercompany transactions, decreased $78.2 million, or 11.4%, to $604.8 million, in 2020 compared with 2019. The significant drivers for the overall change were as follows:\n\u2022Revenues from retail electric operations at SJE, net of intercompany transactions, decreased $42.5 million to $33.4 million, primarily due to lower overall sales volumes as SJE chose not to renew several contracts that have expired over the last twelve months. Partially offsetting this decrease was the change in unrealized gains and losses recorded on forward financial contracts due to price volatility, which is excluded for Economic Earnings and represented a total increase of $3.8 million.\nSJE uses forward financial contracts to mitigate commodity price risk on fixed price electric contracts. In accordance with GAAP, the forward financial contracts are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings in the period of change. The related customer contracts are not considered derivatives and, therefore, are not recorded in earnings until the electricity is delivered. As a result, earnings are subject to volatility as the market price of the forward financial contracts change, even when the underlying hedged value of the customer contract is unchanged. Over time, gains or losses on the sale of the fixed price electric under contract will be offset by losses or gains on the forward financial contracts, resulting in the realization of the profit margin expected when the transactions were initiated. The retail electric operations at SJE serve both fixed and market-priced customers.\n\u2022Revenues from wholesale energy operations at SJRG, net of intercompany transactions, decreased $35.8 million to $571.1 million, primarily due to decreases in the average monthly NYMEX settle price, along with maintenance and scheduled outages at several electric generation facilities during the first quarter of 2020. These decreases were partially offset by higher margins on daily energy trading activities, as well as revenues earned on gas supply contracts with two electric generation facilities that began operating in 2020. Also impacting the comparative period revenues was the change in unrealized gains and losses recorded on forward financial contracts due to price volatility, which is excluded for Economic Earnings and represented a total increase of $8.5 million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues and expenses related to the energy trading activities of the wholesale energy operations at SJRG are presented on a net basis in Operating Revenues - Nonutility on the consolidated statement of income.\nOperating Revenues - Energy Services 2020 vs. 2019 - Combined revenues for Energy Services, net of intercompany transactions, decreased $31.9 million, or 66.3%, to $16.2 million in 2020 compared with 2019. The significant drivers for the overall change were as follows:\n\u2022Revenues from on-site energy production at Marina, net of intercompany transactions, decreased $31.9 million to $14.2 million, primarily due to lack of revenues from MTF and ACB subsequent to the sale that was completed February 18, 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022The change in revenues from appliance service operations at SJESP, net of intercompany transactions, was not significant.\nGross Margin - Energy Group & Energy Services - Gross margin for the Energy Group and Energy Services businesses is a GAAP measure and is defined as revenue less all costs that are directly related to the production, sale and delivery of SJI's products and services. These costs primarily include natural gas and electric commodity costs as well as certain payroll and related benefits. On the statements of consolidated income, revenue is reflected in Operating Revenues - Nonutility and the costs are reflected in Cost of Sales - Nonutility. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues and expenses related to the energy trading activities of the wholesale energy operations at SJRG are presented on a net basis in Operating Revenues - Nonutility on the statements of consolidated income.\nGross margin is broken out between Energy Group and Energy Services below, which are each comprised of a group of segments as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nGross Margin - Energy Group 2020 vs. 2019 - Combined gross margins for Energy Group increased $34.2 million to $43.9 million for 2020 compared with 2019. The significant drivers for the overall change were as follows:\n\u2022Gross margin from the wholesale energy operations at SJRG increased $32.9 million to $44.1 million, primarily due to higher margins on daily energy trading activities. Also contributing to the increase was a refund received from a third party gas supplier as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, as well as the change in unrealized gains and losses recorded on forward financial contracts due to price volatility, which is excluded for Economic Earnings and represented a total increase of $8.5 million.\nWe expect the wholesale energy operations at SJRG to continue to add incremental margin from marketing and related opportunities in the Marcellus region, capitalizing on its established presence in the area. Future margins could fluctuate significantly due to the volatile nature of wholesale gas prices. As of December 31, 2020, the wholesale energy operations had 4.6 MMdts of storage and 423,030 dts/d of transportation under contract.\n\u2022Gross margin from SJE's retail electric operations increased $1.1 million to a loss of $0.4 million, primarily due to the change in unrealized gains and losses recorded on forward financial contracts due to price volatility, which is excluded for Economic Earnings and represented a total increase of $3.8 million. Partially offsetting this increase is overall lower sales volumes as SJE did not renew several contracts that have expired over the last twelve months.\nGross Margin - Energy Services 2020 vs. 2019 - Combined gross margins for Energy Services decreased $25.1 million to $15.9 million for 2020 compared with 2019. The significant drivers for the overall change were as follows:\n\u2022Gross margin from on-site energy production at Marina decreased $25.1 million to $13.9 million, primarily due to lack of margin from MTF and ACB subsequent to the sale that was completed February 18, 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022The change in gross margin from appliance service operations at SJESP was not significant.\nOperations Expense - All Segments - A summary of net changes in operations expense follows (in thousands):\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> <td>2019 vs. 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SJI Utilities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> SJG Utility Operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>352 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,282) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> ETG Utility Operations </td> <td>13,965 </td> <td> </td> <td>23,681 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> ELK Utility Operations </td> <td>(693) </td> <td> </td> <td>812 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Subtotal SJI Utilities </td> <td>13,624 </td> <td> </td> <td>20,211 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Energy Group: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Wholesale Energy Operations </td> <td>(363) </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,080) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Retail Gas and Other Operations </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,272) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Retail Electric Operations </td> <td>(160) </td> <td> </td> <td>1,148 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Subtotal Energy Group </td> <td>(523) </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,204) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Energy Services: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> On-Site Energy Production </td> <td>(16,151) </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,633) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Appliance Service Operations </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> <td>(210) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Subtotal Energy Services </td> <td>(16,082) </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,843) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Midstream </td> <td>313 </td> <td> </td> <td>(138) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate & Services and Intercompany Eliminations </td> <td>(2,770) </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,136) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total Operations Expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,438) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18,110) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe change in SJG utility operations expense in 2020 compared with 2019 was not significant.\nETG utility operations expense increased $14.0 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to the operation of ETG's RAC, which experienced an aggregate net increase. Such costs are recovered on a dollar-for-dollar basis; therefore, ETG experienced an offsetting increase in revenue compared with the prior year. Also contributing to the increase was higher expenses in various areas, most notably those associated with corporate support.\nCombined operations expense for Energy Group and Energy Services decreased $16.6 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to the sale of MTF and ACB (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nThe Corporate & Services segment had a $2.8 million decrease in Operations Expense in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to less severance and other employee separation costs and less costs incurred to exit the TSA, which occurred in March 2020, along with intercompany eliminations. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in operations expense at SJEI due to the acquisitions of AEP and EnerConnex (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nImpairment Charges - No impairment charges were recorded during 2020. Marina incurred approximately $10.8 million of impairment charges during 2019 related to the expected purchase price of two of the unsold solar sites being less than their carrying value, along with charges resulting from the purchase price in the agreement to sell MTF and ACB being less than its carrying value (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). These impairment charges were recorded in the On-Site Energy Production segment.\nMaintenance Expense - Maintenance expense increased $1.5 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to increased maintenance of services activity and higher levels of RAC amortization at SJG. This increase in RAC-related expenses does not affect earnings, as SJG recognizes an offsetting amount in revenues. This increase at SJG was partially offset by lower repair expenses at ETG in 2020 compared with 2019.\nDepreciation Expense - Depreciation expense increased $19.0 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to increased investment in property, plant and equipment by the gas utility operations of SJG and ETG, along with depreciation recorded on solar projects previously held for sale. This was partially offset by the MTF & ACB sale (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nEnergy and Other Taxes - The change in Energy and Other Taxes in 2020 compared with 2019 was not significant.\nNet Gain on Sales of Assets - During 2020, the Company recognized $1.1 million in net gains on the sale of MTF and ACB, $0.8 million on the sale of assets related to solar projects and $0.7 million on the sale of ELK. During 2019, the Company recognized $3.1 million in net gains on the sale of assets related to solar projects, with these gains pertaining to those projects that were not impaired as discussed above. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOther Income and Expense - Other income and expense increased $3.8 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to the step acquisition gain recorded in connection with the EnerConnex acquisition (see Notes 1 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements), along with higher AFUDC income at SJG and ETG.\nInterest Charges - Interest charges increased $4.1 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to interest incurred on higher amounts of long-term debt outstanding at SJI and SJG.\nIncome Taxes - Income tax expense increased $1.6 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes in 2020 compared with the prior year along with a state deferred tax valuation allowance recorded (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). These were partially offset with the benefits from ITC recorded on the assets of recently acquired fuel cell and solar projects that commenced operations in 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nEquity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies - The change in equity in earnings of affiliated companies in 2020 compared with 2019 was not significant.\nDiscontinued Operations - The losses are primarily comprised of environmental remediation and product liability litigation associated with previously disposed of businesses.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES:\nFor information on the changes in liquidity and capital resources from 2019 compared to 2018, refer to the Management Discussion & Analysis section in Item 7 of SJI's and SJG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity needs are driven by factors that include natural gas commodity prices; the impact of weather on customer bills; lags in fully collecting gas costs from customers under the BGSS charge and other regulatory clauses; settlement of legal matters; environmental remediation expenditures through the RAC; working capital needs of SJI's energy trading and marketing activities; the timing of construction and remediation expenditures and related permanent financings; the timing of equity contributions to unconsolidated affiliates; mandated tax payment dates; both discretionary and required repayments of long-term debt; acquisitions; and the amounts and timing of dividend payments.\nCash flows for the years ended December 31, were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>311,639 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,052 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>143,583 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Used in Investing Activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(507,751) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(477,648) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,788,785) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>209,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>353,298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,637,186 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities - Liquidity needs are first met with net cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities varies from year-to-year primarily due to the impact of weather on customer demand and related gas purchases, customer usage factors related to conservation efforts and the price of the natural gas commodity, inventory utilization, and gas cost recoveries. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2020 produced more net cash than 2019, primarily due to the following: (1) cash payments related to a legal proceeding of a pricing dispute which were paid during 2019 and did not recur in 2020 (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements); (2) a refund from a third party gas supplier that was received in July 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements); (3) higher ETG revenues due to favorable changes in base rates resulting from the completion of ETG's rate case in November 2019 (see \"ETG Utility Operations\"); (4) higher margins and increased collections on daily energy trading activities at SJRG; and (5) customer growth and lower costs experienced at SJG for environmental remediation. These increases were partially offset by SJI terminating its interest rate swaps in December 2020 at a price of $8.2 million (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\nCash Flows from Investing Activities - SJI has a continuing need for cash resources and capital, primarily to invest in new and replacement facilities and equipment. We estimate the cash outflows for investing activities, net of refinancings and returns/advances on investments from affiliates, for 2021, 2022 and 2023 to be approximately $686.4 million, $625.1 million and $624.8 million, respectively. The high level of investing activities for 2021, 2022 and 2023 is due to the accelerated infrastructure investment programs and future capital expenditures at SJG and ETG, projected investment in PennEast, and investments in future renewable energy projects. SJI expects to use short-term borrowings under lines of credit from commercial banks and a commercial paper program to finance these investing activities as incurred. From time to time, SJI may refinance the short-term debt with long-term debt.\nOther significant investing activities of SJI during 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n\u2022In 2020, SJI received approximately $119.8 million in total from the sales of MTF and ACB, ELK and a solar project. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022In 2020, SJI paid approximately $21.6 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of EnerConnex, the renewable natural gas development rights in certain dairy farms and four solar LLCs. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022In 2020, SJI paid $80.2 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire a 93% ownership interest in Annadale. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022SJI made net investments in unconsolidated affiliates of $28.9 million, $8.3 million and $6.6 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Included in 2020 is SJI's acquisition of its 35% ownership interest in REV LNG and capital contribution loans made to REV LNG. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022SJI received approximately $26.8 million and $310.6 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, from the sale of certain solar assets along with the sale of SJE's retail gas operations (2018). See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022In 2019, SJI received $15.6 million as an adjustment to the purchase price related to the ETG/ELK Acquisition.\n\u2022In 2019, SJI paid $4.0 million to acquire AEP. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022In 2018, SJI paid $11.3 million to enter into a new asset management agreement. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022In 2018, SJI paid approximately $1.7 billion for the ETG/ELK Acquisition. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities - SJI supplements its operating cash flow, commercial paper program and credit lines with both debt and equity capital to support working capital needs and to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions as incurred.\nSJG has a commercial paper program under which SJG may issue short-term, unsecured promissory notes to qualified investors up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $200.0 million. The notes have fixed maturities which vary by note, but may not exceed 270 days from the date of issue. Proceeds from the notes are used for general corporate purposes. SJG uses the commercial paper program in tandem with its $200.0 million revolving credit facility and the principal amount of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the credit facility cannot exceed an aggregate of $200.0 million.\nOver the years, SJG has used long-term debt, primarily in the form of First Mortgage Bonds and MTN's, secured by the same pool of utility assets, to finance its long-term borrowing needs. These needs are primarily capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment.\nCredit facilities and available liquidity as of December 31, 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>Usage </td> <td> </td> <td>Available Liquidity </td> <td> </td> <td>Expiration Date </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SJI: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> SJI Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>334,600 </td> <td> </td> <td>(A) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>165,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>August 2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Term Loan Credit Agreement </td> <td> </td> <td>150,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>March 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total SJI </td> <td> </td> <td>650,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>484,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>165,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SJG: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Commercial Paper Program/Revolving Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>200,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,300 </td> <td> </td> <td>(B) </td> <td>151,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>August 2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Uncommitted Bank Line </td> <td> </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>September 2021 (D) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total SJG </td> <td> </td> <td>210,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>161,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ETG/SJIU: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> ETG/SJIU Revolving Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>200,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,900 </td> <td> </td> <td>(C) </td> <td>125,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>April 2022 (D) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,060,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>607,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>452,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(A) Includes letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $9.6 million, which is used to enable SJE to market retail electricity as well as for various construction and operating activities.\n(B) Includes letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $0.8 million, which supports the remediation of environmental conditions at certain locations in SJG's service territory.\n(C) Includes letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $1.0 million, which supports ETG's construction activity.\n(D) These facilities were renewed in 2020.\nFor SJI and SJG, the amount of usage shown in the table above, less the letters of credit noted in (A)-(C) for SJI and (B) only for SJG above, equals the amounts recorded as Notes Payable on the respective consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020.\nBased upon the existing credit facilities and a regular dialogue with our banks, we believe there will continue to be sufficient credit available to meet our business' future liquidity needs.\nEach of the credit facilities are provided by a syndicate of banks. The NPA for Senior Unsecured Notes issued by SJI, and the Utilities' credit facilities, contain a financial covenant limiting the ratio of indebtedness to total capitalization (as defined in the respective NPA or credit agreement) to not more than 0.70 to 1, measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. SJI and the Utilities were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2020. For SJI, the equity units are treated as equity (as opposed to how they are classified on the consolidated balance sheet, as long-term debt; see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements) for purposes of the covenant calculation.\nAlthough there can be no assurance, management believes that actions presently being taken to pay off or refinance the short-term debt and borrowings that are due within the next year will be successful, as the Company has been successful in refinancing debt in the past. No adjustments have been made to the financial statements to account for this uncertainty.\nFor additional information regarding the terms of the credit facilities as well as weighted average interest rates, average borrowings outstanding and maximum amounts outstanding under these credit facilities see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOther Financing Activity - 2020\nDebt Issuances/Paydowns:\nOn March 26, 2020, SJI entered into an unsecured $150.0 million term loan agreement, which bears interest at variable rates. The maturity date of the term loan is March 25, 2021, and the loan is recorded in Notes Payable on the consolidated balance sheets. The proceeds of the loan were used for general corporate purposes.\nOn April 3, 2020, SJI entered into an unsecured $200.0 million term loan credit agreement, which bears interest at variable rates. Proceeds from the debt were used to pay down the following:\n\u2022$50.0 million outstanding on the SJI revolving credit facility, which was previously recorded in Notes Payable on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\u2022$100.0 million SJI Term Loan, which was previously recorded in Notes Payable on the consolidated balance sheets and due to mature in September 2020.\n\u2022$50.0 million SJI variable rate note, which was previously recorded in current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOn April 16, 2020, SJG entered into a NPA which provided for SJG to issue and sell its Senior Secured Notes, Series F, 2020 in the aggregate principal amount of $525.0 million in three Tranches; Tranche A and B totaled $400.0 million and were issued on April 16, 2020 while Tranche C of $125.0 million was issued on October 1, 2020. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. On April 26, 2020, SJG used proceeds from Tranche A and B to pay off $400.0 million principal amount outstanding on its term loan credit agreement, which was previously recorded in current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. SJG used the Tranche C proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nOn May 27, 2020, SJI entered into a NPA which provided for the Company to issue an aggregate of $200.0 million of senior unsecured notes in two tranches, both of which were issued on July 30, 2020. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. The proceeds from these issuances were used to pay off the unsecured $200.0 million term loan credit agreement issued in April 2020 discussed above, which was paid off on July 31, 2020.\nIn September 2020, SJG paid off $10.0 million of the principal balance outstanding on its 3.00% MTNs. In November 2020, SJG paid off $7.0 million of the principal balance outstanding on its 3.03% MTNs.\nSJG makes payments of $0.9 million annually through December 2025 toward the principal amount of 3.63% MTNs, including a payment made in 2020.\nOn November 10, 2020, ETG entered into a Bond Purchase Agreement which provided for ETG to issue an aggregate of $250.0 million of first mortgage bonds in 5 tranches. The first two tranches totaled $125.0 million and were issued on November 10, 2020, while the final three tranches totaling $125.0 million are expected to be issued on June 15, 2021. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\nEquity Activity:\nIn April 2020, SJI entered into an ATM Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the \"Sales Agreement\") to sell, from time to time, shares of the Company's common stock, par value $1.25 per share, having an aggregate sale price up to $200.0 million, through an at-the-market\u201d equity offering program. Pursuant to the Sales Agreement, the shares of common stock were to be offered and sold through any of the named sales agents in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be at-the-market\u201d offerings. In June 2020, 8,122,283 shares were sold pursuant to the Sales Agreement at an average market price of approximately $24.62 for total net proceeds of $198.0 million after deducting commissions and other general & administrative expenses. These sales exhausted the shares that were available for sale under the Sales Agreement. The Company is using the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes.\nOn October 16, 2020, SJI filed an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation that increased the authorized number of shares of its common stock from 120,000,000 to 220,000,000 and the aggregate number of shares authorized to be issued by SJI from 122,500,000 to 222,500,000.\nOther Financing Activity - 2019\nProceeds from the Sale of Common Stock\nSJI settled its equity forward sale agreement (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements) by delivering 6,779,661 shares of common stock and receiving net cash proceeds of approximately $189.0 million. The forward price used to determine cash proceeds received by SJI at settlement was calculated based on the initial forward sale price, as adjusted for underwriting fees, interest rate adjustments as specified in the equity forward agreement and any dividends paid on our common stock during the forward period.\nDebt Issuances:\nSJI offered and sold $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.625% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2079. The total net cash proceeds, inclusive of a debt discount of $5.3 million, were $194.7 million.\nETG entered into a Bond Purchase Agreement and issued First Mortgage Bonds, Series 2019A-1 through Series 2019A-4, in the aggregate principal amount of $145.0 million. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2019, SJG borrowed $400.0 million on its term loan credit agreement, including borrowing the remaining $90.0 million (which was available as of December 31, 2018) in 2019. All loans under this term loan credit agreement were paid on April 26, 2020 as noted above.\nDebt Repayments:\nSJI repaid $475.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding on its Floating Rate Senior Notes, Series 2018D.\nSJI paid off the following: $60.0 million principal amount outstanding on its 3.30% Senior Notes, Series 2014A-1; $40.0 million principal amount outstanding on its Floating Rate Senior Notes, Series 2014B-1; $30.0 million principal amount outstanding on its 3.30% Senior Notes, Series 2014A-2; $50.0 million principal amount outstanding on its 3.30% Senior Notes, Series 2014A-3; and $60.0 million principal amount outstanding on its Floating Rate Senior Notes, Series 2014B-2.\nSJG retired $10.0 million of 5.587% MTN's.\nSJG paid $8.0 million in November 2019 that was due on its 4.01% MTN's,\nDRP - See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE - SJI's capital structure was as follows:\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity </td> <td>32.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>29.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt </td> <td>56.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>52.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-Term Debt </td> <td>11.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>17.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, SJI paid quarterly dividends to its common shareholders. SJI has a long history of paying dividends on its common stock and has increased its dividend every year since 1999. SJI's current long-term goals are to grow the dividend at a rate consistent with earnings growth over the long term, subject to the approval of its Board of Directors, with a long-term targeted payout ratio of between 55% and 65% of Economic Earnings. In setting the dividend rate, the Board of Directors of SJI considers future earnings expectations, payout ratio, and dividend yield relative to those at peer companies, as well as returns available on other income-oriented investments. However, there can be no assurance that SJI will be able to continue to increase the dividend, meet the targeted payout ratio or pay a dividend at all in the future.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:\nENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION - Costs for remediation projects, net of recoveries from ratepayers, for 2020, 2019 and 2018 amounted to net cash outflows of $19.3 million, $49.2 million and $59.3 million, respectively. These include environmental remediation liabilities of ETG associated with five former manufactured gas plant sites in New Jersey which are recoverable from customers through rate mechanisms approved by the BPU. See the Contractual Cash Obligations Table below for the total expected net cash outflows for remediation projects for future years. As discussed in Notes 10, 11 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, certain environmental costs are subject to recovery from ratepayers.\nSTANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT - See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCONVERTIBLE UNITS - The Company has a contract obligating the holder of the units to purchase from the Company, and for the Company to sell to the holder for a price in cash of $50, a certain number of shares of common stock. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS - SJG and SJRG have certain commitments for both pipeline capacity and gas supply for which they pay fees regardless of usage. Those commitments as of December 31, 2020, average $96.7 million annually and total $760.5 million over the contracts' lives. Approximately 38% of the financial commitments under these contracts expire during the next five years. These contracts are included in SJI's contractual obligations below. We expect to renew each of these contracts under renewal provisions as provided in each contract. SJG recovers all prudently incurred fees through rates via the BGSS clause.\nIn addition, in the normal course of business, SJG and SJRG have entered into long-term contracts for natural gas supplies. SJRG has committed to purchase 721,900 dts/d of natural gas, from various suppliers, for terms ranging from five to eleven years at index-based prices. SJG has committed to a purchase of a minimum of 15,000 dts/d and up to 70,000 dts/d, from a supplier for a term of ten years at index-based prices. Also, in 2019 SJG entered into a two-year purchase agreement with a producer delivering 5,000 dts/day at SJG's Leidy Line for certified responsible gas from November 1, 2019 through October 31, 2021. The obligations for these purchases have not been included in the contractual obligations table below because the actual volumes and prices are not fixed.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations, in addition to those related to our usage of short-term borrowings under our credit facilities discussed above, and their applicable payment due dates as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Up to </td> <td>Years </td> <td>Years </td> <td>More than </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Cash Obligations </td> <td>Total </td> <td>1 Year </td> <td>2 & 3 </td> <td>4 & 5 </td> <td>5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal Payments on Long-Term Debt </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,950,946 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>142,801 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106,168 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131,168 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,570,809 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Long-Term Debt </td> <td>2,300,681 </td> <td> </td> <td>118,181 </td> <td> </td> <td>219,719 </td> <td> </td> <td>211,122 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,751,659 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction Obligations </td> <td>390,147 </td> <td> </td> <td>390,147 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Leases </td> <td>2,036 </td> <td> </td> <td>653 </td> <td> </td> <td>772 </td> <td> </td> <td>431 </td> <td> </td> <td>180 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance Leases </td> <td>7,137 </td> <td> </td> <td>145 </td> <td> </td> <td>290 </td> <td> </td> <td>290 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,412 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commodity Supply Purchase Obligations </td> <td>1,704,417 </td> <td> </td> <td>649,492 </td> <td> </td> <td>449,883 </td> <td> </td> <td>184,798 </td> <td> </td> <td>420,244 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental Remediation Costs </td> <td>193,575 </td> <td> </td> <td>45,265 </td> <td> </td> <td>98,743 </td> <td> </td> <td>20,969 </td> <td> </td> <td>28,598 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New Jersey Clean Energy Program </td> <td>26,321 </td> <td> </td> <td>26,321 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Purchase Obligations </td> <td>5,786 </td> <td> </td> <td>5,786 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Contractual Cash Obligations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,581,046 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,378,791 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>875,575 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>548,778 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,777,902 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-Term Debt in the table above does not include unamortized debt issuance costs of $29.6 million and unamortized debt discounts of $5.2 million, which are recorded as an offset to Long-Term Debt on the consolidated balance sheets.\nInterest on long-term debt in the table above includes the related interest obligations through maturity on all outstanding long-term debt. Expected asset retirement obligations and the liability for unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the table above as the total obligation cannot be calculated due to the subjective nature of these costs and timing of anticipated payments. SJI did not make contributions to its employee pension plans in 2020. Future pension contributions cannot be determined at this time. SJG's regulatory obligation to contribute $3.7 million annually to its postretirement benefit plans' trusts, as discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, is also not included as its duration is indefinite.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS - An off-balance sheet arrangement is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which SJI has either made guarantees or has certain other interests or obligations.\nSee \"Guarantees\" in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail.\nNOTES RECEIVABLE-AFFILIATES - See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\nLITIGATION - SJI and SJG are subject to claims, actions and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Neither SJI nor SJG can make any assurance as to the outcome of any of these actions but, based on an analysis of these claims and consultation with outside counsel, we do not believe that any of these claims, other than those described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the business or financial statements of SJI or SJG. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail on these claims.\nSOUTH JERSEY GAS COMPANY\nThis section of Management's Discussion focuses on SJG for the reported periods. In many cases, explanations and disclosures for both SJI and SJG are substantially the same or specific disclosures for SJG are included in the Management's Discussion for SJI.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS:\nFor information on the changes in SJG's results of operations from 2019 compared to 2018, refer to the Management Discussion & Analysis section in Item 7 of SJI's and SJG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe results of operations for the SJG utility operations are described above; therefore, this section primarily focuses on statistical information and other information that is not discussed in the results of operations under South Jersey Industries, Inc. Refer to the section entitled Results of Operations - SJG Utility Operations\u201d for a discussion of the results of operations for SJG.\nThe following table summarizes the composition of selected gas utility throughput for the years ended December 31, (in thousands, except for degree day data):\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utility Throughput -

Annual degree-days is the sum of the daily totals.\nThroughput - Gas Utility Operations 2020 vs. 2019 - Total gas throughput decreased 23.6 MMdts, or 15%, in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to decreases in capacity release, which was due to warmer than normal weather that impacted the winter season and created less demand in SJG service territory. In addition, the decrease is the result of specific segmented releases on the Transco pipeline which were lower in 2020 compared to 2019.\nOperating Revenues & Utility Margin - See SJI's Management Discussion section above.\nOperations Expense - See SJI's Management Discussion section above.\nMaintenance Expense - See SJI's Management Discussion section above.\nDepreciation Expense - Depreciation expense increased $5.1 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to continuing investment in utility plant. The increased spending in recent years is a direct result of New Jersey's infrastructure improvement efforts, which included the approval of SJG's AIRP and SHARP, in addition to significant investment in new technology systems.\nEnergy and Other Taxes - The change in Energy and Other Taxes in 2020 compared with 2019 was not significant.\nOther Income and Expense - Other Income and Expense increased $1.2 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to higher AFUDC income.\nInterest Charges - Interest charges increased $1.7 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to higher amounts of long-term debt outstanding (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements).\nIncome Taxes - Income tax expense generally fluctuates as income before taxes changes. Minor variations will occur period to period as a result of effective tax rate adjustments.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES:\nFor information on the changes in SJG's liquidity and capital resources from 2019 compared to 2018, refer to the Management Discussion & Analysis section in Item 7 of SJI's and SJG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity and capital resources for SJG are substantially covered in the Management's Discussion of SJI (except for the items and transactions that relate to SJI and its nonutility subsidiaries). Those explanations are incorporated by reference into this discussion.\nLiquidity needs for SJG are driven by factors that include natural gas commodity prices; the impact of weather on customer bills; lags in fully collecting gas costs from customers under the BGSS charge, settlement of legal matters, and environmental remediation expenditures through the RAC; the timing of construction and remediation expenditures and related permanent financings; mandated tax payment dates; both discretionary and required repayments of long-term debt; and the amounts and timing of dividend payments.\nCash flows for the year ended December 31 were the following (in thousands):\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>191,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>112,974 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Used in Investing Activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(280,557) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(263,071) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(240,703) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>134,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,372 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities - Liquidity needs are first met with net cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities varies from year-to-year primarily due to the impact of weather on customer demand and related gas purchases, customer usage factors related to conversion efforts and the price of the natural gas commodity, inventory utilization, and gas cost recoveries. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2020 produced more net cash than 2019, primarily due to a cash payment related to a legal proceeding of a pricing dispute which was paid during the third quarter of 2019 (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements) and did not recur in 2020, along with customer growth and lower costs for environmental remediation.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities - SJG has a continuing need for cash resources for capital expenditures, primarily to invest in new and replacement facilities and equipment. SJG estimates the net cash outflows for capital expenditures for fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023 to be approximately $256.8 million, $240.2 million and $325.1 million, respectively. For capital expenditures, including those under the AIRP, SHARP and IIP, SJG expects to use short-term borrowings under both its commercial paper program and lines of credit from commercial banks to finance capital expenditures as incurred. From time to time, SJG may refinance the short-term debt incurred to support capital expenditures with long-term debt.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities - SJG supplements its operating cash flow and credit lines with both debt and equity capital. Over the years, SJG has used long-term debt, primarily in the form of First Mortgage Bonds and MTNs, secured by the same pool of utility assets, to finance its long-term borrowing needs. These needs are primarily capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment.\nCash dividends were not declared or paid by SJG to SJI in 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nSJG received $109.5 million in equity contributions from SJI in 2020; there were no equity contributions to SJG in 2019 or 2018. Future equity contributions will occur on an as needed basis.\nFor information on other financing activities at SJG, see the SJI Management & Discussion Analysis above.\nCapital Structure - SJG's capital structure was as follows:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common Equity </td> <td>53.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>49.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt </td> <td>44.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>43.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-Term Debt </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:\nCosts for remediation projects, net of recoveries from ratepayers, for 2020, 2019 and 2018, amounted to net cash outflows of $27.2 million, $42.7 million and $53.7 million, respectively. See the Contractual Cash Obligations Table below for the total expected net cash outflows for remediation projects for future years. As discussed in Notes 10, 11 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, environmental remediation costs are subject to recovery from ratepayers.\nSJG has certain commitments for both pipeline capacity and gas supply for which SJG pays fees regardless of usage. Those commitments, as of December 31, 2020, averaged $80.5 million annually and totaled $387.1 million over the contracts' lives. Approximately 35% of the financial commitments under these contracts expire during the next five years. SJG expects to renew each of these contracts under renewal provisions as provided in each contract. SJG recovers all such prudently incurred fees through rates via the BGSS.\nSee SJI's Contractual Obligations discussion related to SJG's long-term contracts for natural gas supplies which are not included in the table below.\nThe following table summarizes SJG's contractual cash obligations and their applicable payment due dates as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Cash Obligations </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Up to\n1 Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Years\n2 & 3\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Years\n4 & 5\n</td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal Payments on Long-Term Debt </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,078,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,809 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>873,301 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Long-Term Debt </td> <td>662,399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,076 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>475,004 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commodity Supply Purchase Obligations </td> <td>421,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>139,303 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental Remediation Costs </td> <td>101,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,557 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,744 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction Obligations </td> <td>352,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>352,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Leases </td> <td>762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New Jersey Clean Energy Program </td> <td>13,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Purchase Obligations </td> <td>5,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Contractual Cash Obligations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,635,463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>595,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>325,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>213,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,501,442 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-Term Debt in the table above does not include unamortized debt issuance costs of $9.4 million, which are recorded as an offset to Long-Term Debt on the balance sheets.\nInterest on long-term debt in the table above includes the related interest obligations through maturity on all outstanding long-term debt.\nExpected asset retirement obligations and the liability for unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the table above as the total obligation cannot be calculated due to the subjective nature of these costs and timing of anticipated payments.\nSJG did not make a pension plan contribution in 2020. Future pension contributions cannot be determined at this time. SJG's regulatory obligation to contribute $3.7 million annually to its postretirement benefit plans' trusts, as discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, is also not included as its duration is indefinite.\nLitigation - See SJG's disclosure in the Commitments and Contingencies section of SJI's Management Discussion above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements - SJG has no off-balance sheet arrangements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations\nIntroduction\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Management's Discussion) analyzes the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of SJI and its subsidiaries. It also includes management's analysis of past financial results and potential factors that may affect future results, potential future risks and approaches that may be used to manage them. Except where the content clearly indicates otherwise, SJI,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d or our\u201d refers to the holding company or the consolidated entity of SJI and all of its subsidiaries.\nManagement's Discussion is divided into the following two major sections:\n\u2022SJI - This section describes the financial condition and results of operations of SJI and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. It includes discussions of our regulated operations, including SJG, and our non-regulated operations.\n\u2022SJG - This section describes the financial condition and results of operations of SJG, a subsidiary of SJI and separate registrant, which comprises the SJG utility operations segment.\nBoth sections of Management's Discussion - SJI and SJG - are designed to provide an understanding of each company's respective operations and financial performance and should be read in conjunction with each other as well as in conjunction with the respective company's financial statements and the combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUnless otherwise noted, earnings per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis, and are based on weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding.\nOVERVIEW - SJI (or the Company) is an energy services holding company that provides a variety of products and services through the following direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries:\nSJIU\nSJIU was established as a subsidiary of SJI for the purpose of serving as a holding company that owns SJG, ETG and, until its sale, ELK.\nSJG\nSJG, a New Jersey corporation, is an operating public utility company engaged in the purchase, transmission and sale of natural gas for residential, commercial and industrial use. SJG also sells natural gas and pipeline transportation capacity (off-system sales) on a wholesale basis to various customers on the interstate pipeline system and transports natural gas purchased directly from producers or suppliers to their customers. SJG contributed approximately $108.1 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis in 2020.\nSJG's service territory covers approximately 2,500 square miles in the southern part of New Jersey. It includes 113 municipalities throughout Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland and Salem Counties and portions of Burlington, Camden and Gloucester Counties. SJG benefits from its proximity to Philadelphia, PA and Wilmington, DE on the western side of its service territory and the popular shore communities on the eastern side. Continuing expansion of SJG's infrastructure throughout its seven-county region has fueled annual customer growth and creates opportunities for future extension into areas not yet served by natural gas.\nSouthern New Jersey's oceanfront communities continue to experience demand for new single and multifamily homes for both seasonal and year-round living. Demand for existing homes has increased throughout our service territory, in line with national trends. Building expansions in the medical, education, warehouse/distribution, and retail sectors contributed to SJG's growth. At present, SJG serves approximately 80% of households within its territory with natural gas. SJG also serves southern New Jersey's diversified industrial base that includes processors of petroleum and agricultural products; chemical, glass and consumer goods manufacturers; and high technology industrial parks.\nAs of December 31, 2020, SJG served 404,886 residential, commercial and industrial customers in southern New Jersey, compared with 397,090 customers at December 31, 2019. No material part of SJG's business is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers. Gas sales, transportation and capacity release for 2020 amounted to 139.3 MMdts, of which 50.5 MMdts were firm sales and transportation, 1.0 MMdts were interruptible sales and transportation and 87.8 MMdts were off-system sales and capacity release. The breakdown of firm sales and transportation includes 48.1% residential, 22.9% commercial, 19.8% industrial, and 9.2% cogeneration and electric generation. As of December 31, 2020, SJG served 378,103 residential customers, 26,369 commercial customers and 414 industrial customers. This includes 2020 net additions\nof 7,410 residential customers and 386 commercial and industrial customers.\nSJG makes wholesale gas sales to gas marketers for resale and ultimate delivery to end users. These off-system\u201d sales are made possible through the issuance of the FERC Orders No. 547 and 636. Order No. 547 issued a blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing all parties, which are not interstate pipelines, to make FERC jurisdictional gas sales for resale at negotiated rates, while Order No. 636 allowed SJG to deliver gas at delivery points on the interstate pipeline system other than its own city gate stations and release excess pipeline capacity to third parties. During 2020, off-system sales amounted to 14.8 MMdts and capacity release amounted to 73.0 MMdts.\nSupplies of natural gas available to SJG that are in excess of the quantity required by those customers who use gas as their sole source of fuel (firm customers) make possible the sale and transportation of gas on an interruptible basis to commercial and industrial customers whose equipment is capable of using natural gas or other fuels, such as fuel oil and propane. The term interruptible\u201d is used in the sense that deliveries of natural gas may be terminated by SJG at any time if this action is necessary to meet the needs of higher priority customers as described in SJG's tariffs. In 2020, usage by interruptible customers, excluding off-system customers, amounted to 1.0 MMdts, or approximately 1% of the total throughput.\nETG\nOn July 1, 2018, SJI, through its wholly-owned subsidiary SJIU, acquired the assets of ETG and ELK from Pivotal Utility Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of Southern Company Gas. ELK was subsequently sold to a third party on July 31, 2020.\nETG is a regulated natural gas utility which distributes natural gas in seven counties in northern and central New Jersey. ETG serves residential, business and industrial customers, with a service territory that covers the northern part of New Jersey, including municipalities throughout Union, Middlesex, Sussex, Warren, Hunterdon, Morris and Mercer Counties. ETG was founded in 1855 and is based in Union, New Jersey. ETG contributed net income of approximately $47.7 million during 2020.\nETG believes growth exists in the expansion of its Northwestern service territory, the Franklin/Sparta area, and the Hackettstown Interconnect. ETG also serves northern New Jersey's diversified industrial base within its territory with natural gas, which includes pharmaceutical, food and beverage, and transportation industries.\nAs of December 31, 2020, ETG served 301,613 customers in northern and central New Jersey, including 277,852 residential customers, 23,663 commercial customers and 98 industrial customers. As of December 31, 2019, ETG served 297,191 customers. No material part of ETG's business is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers. Gas sales and transportation for 2020 amounted to 47.4 MMdts, of which 41.1 MMdts were firm sales and transportation and 6.3 MMdts were interruptible sales and transportation. The breakdown of firm sales and transportation includes 22.4 MMdts residential, 13.2 MMdts commercial, and 5.5 MMdts industrial.\nSJES\nSJI established SJES as a direct subsidiary for the purpose of serving as a holding company for all of SJI's non-utility businesses. The following businesses are wholly-owned subsidiaries of SJES:\nSJE\nSJE provides services for the acquisition and transportation of electricity for retail end users and markets total energy management services. SJE markets electricity to residential, commercial and industrial customers. Most customers served by SJE are located within New Jersey, northwestern Pennsylvania and New England. In 2020, SJE had a net loss of approximately $1.3 million which reduced SJI's net income on a consolidated basis by such amount.\nSJRG\nSJRG markets natural gas storage, commodity and transportation assets along with fuel management services on a wholesale basis. Customers include energy marketers, electric and gas utilities, power plants and natural gas producers. SJRG's marketing activities occur mainly in the mid-Atlantic, Appalachian and southern regions of the country.\nSJRG also conducts price risk management activities by entering into a variety of physical and financial transactions including forward contracts, swap agreements, option contracts and futures contracts. In 2020, SJRG contributed approximately $25.3 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.\nSJEX\nSJEX owns oil, gas and mineral rights in the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania. SJEX is considered part of SJI's wholesale energy operations. In 2020, SJEX contributed approximately $0.4 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.\nMarina\nMarina develops and operates on-site energy-related projects. There are several businesses under Marina, as discussed below.\nACLE, BCLE, SCLE and SXLE are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Marina, which own and operate landfill gas-to-energy production facilities in Atlantic, Burlington, Salem and Sussex Counties, respectively, located in New Jersey. On June 1, 2020, the BCLE, SCLE, and SXLE landfill gas-to-energy production facilities ceased operations after receiving approval from their respective local governmental authorities to do so.\nMarina owns four LLCs which own and operate rooftop solar generation sites located in New Jersey. All four were acquired in 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nIn 2020, SJI, through Marina, formed the Catamaran joint venture with a third party partner. Catamaran owns 100% of Annadale, of which Marina has a 93% ownership interest. Catamaran was formed for the purpose of developing, owning and operating renewable energy projects, and will support SJI's commitment to clean energy initiatives. Annadale has constructed two fuel cell projects totaling 7.5 MW in Staten Island, New York which began operations in December 2020 (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements).\nAlso in, 2020, the Company sold MTF and ACB for a final sales price of $97.0 million. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. MTF previously provided cooling, heating and emergency power to the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa in Atlantic City, NJ. ACB previously owned and operated a natural gas fueled combined heating, cooling and power facility located in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\nOn June 27, 2018, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Marina, entered into a series of agreements whereby Marina agreed to sell its portfolio of solar energy assets (for this section, the Transaction\u201d) to a third-party buyer. As part of the Transaction, Marina agreed to sell its distributed solar energy projects across New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts and Vermont (for this section, the Projects\u201d), along with the assets comprising the Projects. These sales occurred between 2018-2020. Also in connection with the Transaction, Marina is leasing back from the buyer certain of the Projects that have not yet passed the fifth anniversary of their placed-in-service dates for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The leaseback runs from the date each such project was acquired by the buyer until the later of the first anniversary of the applicable acquisition date and the fifth anniversary of the applicable placed-in-service date of the project. As of December 31, 2020, there are ten projects being leased back from the buyer through the end of 2021, which is the fifth anniversary of their placed-in-service date. The results of these projects being leased back are not material.\nThe Company currently has two projects that are not part of the Transaction and remain owned by Marina. These assets are recorded as held and used in Property, Plant and Equipment on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nIn 2020, Marina contributed approximately $14.9 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.\nSJESP\nSJESP receives commissions on appliance service contracts from a third party. In 2020, SJESP contributed approximately $1.7 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.\nSJEI\nSJEI provides energy procurement and cost reduction services. SJEI includes the following wholly-owned subsidiaries:\nAEP, an aggregator, broker and consultant in the retail energy markets, which was acquired in August 2019.\nEnerConnex, a retail and wholesale broker and consultant that matches end users with suppliers for the procurement of natural gas and electricity, which became 100% owned in 2020 (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements).\nIn 2020, SJEI contributed approximately $0.4 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.\nMidstream\nMidstream owns a 20% equity investment, along with four other investors, in PennEast. In 2020, Midstream contributed approximately $4.2 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.\nOther\nSJI Renewable Energy Ventures, LLC and SJI RNG Devco, LLC are newly formed subsidiaries which hold the equity interest in REV LNG and the renewable natural gas development rights in certain dairy farms, respectively (see Notes 1, 3 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements).\nEMI principally manages liabilities associated with its discontinued operations of nonutility subsidiaries.\nPrimary Factors Affecting SJI's Business\nSJI's current long-term goals are to grow Economic Earnings Per Share 6-8% annually driven by high quality earnings, a strong balance sheet and a low-to-moderate risk profile. Management established those goals in conjunction with SJI's Board of Directors based upon a number of different internal and external factors that characterize and influence SJI's current and expected future activities.\nThe following is a summary of the primary factors we expect to have the greatest impact on SJI's performance and ability to achieve the long-term goals going forward:\nBusiness Model - In developing SJI's current business model, our focus has been on our core Utilities and natural extensions of those businesses, as well as strategic opportunities in our nonutility business that align with the goals of the EMP. That focus enables us to concentrate on business activities that match our core competencies. Going forward we expect to pursue business opportunities that fit and complement this model.\nCustomer Growth - SJG's area of operations is southern New Jersey. Residential new construction activity remains steady, supported by growth in higher density and multi-family units. Customers for SJG grew 2.0% for 2020 as SJG continues its focus on customer conversions. In 2020, the 4,326 consumers converting their homes and businesses from other heating fuels, such as electric, propane or oil, represented approximately 55% of the total new customer acquisitions for the year. Customers in SJG's service territory typically base their decisions to convert on comparisons of fuel costs, environmental considerations and efficiencies. While oil and propane prices have become more competitive with natural gas in the past two years, affecting the number of conversions, SJG began a comprehensive partnership with the State's Office of Clean Energy to educate consumers on energy efficiency and to promote the rebates and incentives available to natural gas users.\nETG's primary area of operations is central and northern NJ, which continues to grow in multifamily housing and gas infrastructure extensions to unserved areas. While ETG continues to partner with builders in the new construction sector with the view of increasing natural gas burner tips, ETG is pursuing conversions throughout its service territory. As a result, customer additions for ETG grew approximately 1.5%. In 2020, consumers converting their homes and businesses from other heating fuels, such as electric, propane or oil, represented approximately 42% of the total new customer acquisitions for the year. Customers in ETG service territories typically base their decisions to convert on fuel cost savings, efficiencies, and fuel stability pricing. ETG leverages its comprehensive partnership with the State's Office of Clean Energy to educate consumers on energy efficiency and to promote the rebates and incentives available to natural gas users.\nRegulatory Environment - SJG and ETG are primarily regulated by the BPU. The BPU approves the rates that are charged to rate-regulated customers for services provided and the terms of service under which the Utilities operate. The rates and established terms of service are designed to enable the Utilities to recover costs of service and obtain a fair and reasonable return on capital invested.\nSJG's BPU approved CIP, along with ETG's BPU approved WNC, protect the Utilities' net income from severe fluctuations in gas used by residential, commercial and small industrial customers.\nSJG's AIRP is a program to replace cast iron and unprotected bare steel mains and services. All AIRP investments are reflected in base rates. Additionally, the BPU issued an Order approving an extension of the AIRP for a five-year period ( AIRP II\u201d), commencing October 1, 2016, with authorized investments of up to $302.5 million to continue replacing cast iron and unprotected bare steel mains and associated services. SJG earns a return on AIRP II investments once they are placed in service and, thereafter, once they are included in rate base, through annual filings. SJG's SHARP is a program to replace low-pressure distribution mains and services with high-pressure mains and services in coastal areas that are susceptible to flooding during major storms. In May 2018, the BPU issued an order approving a second phase of the SHARP (\"SHARP II\") for a three-year period, commencing June 1, 2018, with authorized investments of up to $100.3 million to continue storm hardening efforts to further improve safety, redundancy and resiliency of SJG's natural gas system in coastal areas. Pursuant to the order, SHARP II investments are to be recovered through annual base rate adjustments.\nIn September 2020, the BPU approved the settlement of SJG's rate case petition, resulting in an increase in annual revenues from base rates effective October 1, 2020 of $39.5 million.\nIn September 2020, the BPU approved, on a provisional basis, a $59.4 million decrease in gas cost recoveries, effective October 1, 2020. SJG's BGSS filing included consideration of $22.9 million of costs requested to be recovered over a two-year period related to a previous dispute on a long-term gas supply contract that was settled during 2019. The provisional rate adjustments effective October 1, 2020 include the temporary removal of these amounts to allow for a further review of these costs during the course of this proceeding which we expect to be completed during the second quarter of 2021.\nConsistent with ETG/ELK Acquisition approval, SJI was required to develop a plan, in concert with the BPU and the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel, to address the replacement of ETG's aging infrastructure. In June 2019, the BPU approved a $300.0 million IIP effective July 1, 2019. The Order authorized the recovery of costs associated with ETG's investments of approximately $300.0 million between 2019-2024 to replace its cast-iron and bare steel vintage main and related services. The Order provides for annual recovery of ETG's investments through a separate rate mechanism.\nIn November 2019, the BPU approved the settlement of ETG's rate case petition, resulting in an increase to base rate revenues by $34.0 million with new rates in effect November 15, 2019.\nOn July 2, 2020, the BPU issued an Order authorizing New Jersey's regulated utilities to create a COVID-19-related regulatory asset by deferring on their books and records the prudently incurred incremental costs related to COVID-19 beginning on March 9, 2020 and continuing through September 30, 2021, or 60 days after the termination of the public health emergency, whichever is later. See \"COVID-19\" section below.\nFor more information on the regulatory environments of the Utilities, see Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\nWeather Conditions and Customer Usage Patterns - Usage patterns can be affected by a number of factors, such as wind, precipitation, temperature extremes and customer conservation. SJG's earnings are largely protected from fluctuations in temperatures by the CIP. The CIP has a stabilizing effect on utility earnings as SJG adjusts revenues when actual usage per customer experienced during an annual period varies from an established baseline usage per customer. The WNC rate allows ETG to implement surcharges or credits during the months of October through May to compensate for weather-related changes in customer usage from the previous winter period. The impact of different weather conditions on the earnings of our nonutility businesses is dependent on a range of different factors. Consequently, weather may impact the earnings of SJI's various subsidiaries in different, or even opposite, ways. Further, the profitability of individual subsidiaries may vary from year-to-year despite experiencing substantially similar weather conditions.\nChanges in Natural Gas and Electricity Prices - The Utilities' gas costs are passed on directly to customers without any profit margin added. The price the Utilities charge their periodic customers is set annually, with a regulatory mechanism in place to make limited adjustments to that price during the course of a year. In the event that gas cost increases would justify customer price increases greater than those permitted under the regulatory mechanism, the Utilities can petition the BPU for an incremental rate increase. High prices can make it more difficult for customers to pay their bills and may result in elevated levels of bad debt expense. Among our nonutility activities, the business most likely to be impacted by changes in natural gas prices is our wholesale gas marketing business. Wholesale gas marketing typically benefits from volatility in gas prices during different points in time. The actual price of the commodity does not typically have an impact on the performance of this business line. Our ability to add and retain customers at our retail electric business is affected by the relationship between the price that the utility charges customers for electricity and the cost available in the market at specific points in time. However, retail electric accounts form a very small portion of SJI's overall activities.\nFuel Supply Management - SJRG has acquired pipeline transportation capacity that allows SJRG to match end users, many of which are merchant generators, with producers looking to find a long-term solution for their supply. We currently have nine fuel supply management contracts and expect to continue expanding this business.\nPennEast - Midstream has a 20% investment in PennEast. The PennEast project has been delayed since September 2019 as a result of various court decisions and ongoing appeals. As a result, the Company evaluated its investment in PennEast for other-than-temporary impairment, and at this time, we believe we do not have an other-than-temporary impairment and have not recorded any impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our investment. PennEast management remains committed to pursuing the project and intends to pursue all available options. SJI, along with the other partners, are intending to continue to contribute to the project. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more information, including a timeline of recent events.\nChanges in Interest Rates - SJI has operated in a relatively low interest rate environment over the past several years. Rising interest rates would raise the expense associated with existing variable-rate debt and all issuances of new debt. We have sought to mitigate the impact of a potential rising rate environment by issuing fixed-rate debt. SJG also has derivative transactions to hedge against rising interest rates on its variable-rate debt.\nBalance Sheet Strength - SJI's and SJG's goal is to maintain a strong balance sheet. SJI's average equity-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 33% and 32% as calculated for the four quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. SJG's average equity-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 53% and 51% as calculated for the four quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. A strong balance sheet assists us in maintaining the financial flexibility necessary to take advantage of growth opportunities and to address volatile economic and commodity markets while maintaining a low-to-moderate risk platform.\nLabor and Benefit Costs - Labor and benefit costs have a significant impact on SJI's profitability. Benefit costs, especially those related to pension and health care, have risen in recent years. We seek to manage these costs by revising health care plans offered to existing employees, capping postretirement health care benefits, and changing health care and pension packages offered to new hires. In addition, in 2018, the Company offered an ERIP to non-union, non-Officer employees over the age of 55 years old with 20 or more years of service to the Company as well as to Officers over the age of 55 years old with 5 or more years of service to the Company. In 2020, SJG entered into a VSIP program with IBEW Local 1293 and IAM Local 76 union employees over the age of 60 years old with 10 or more years of service to SJG (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements).\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES - ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS - As described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain types of transactions presented in our consolidated financial statements require a significant amount of judgment and estimation. These relate to regulatory accounting, derivatives, environmental remediation costs, pension and other postretirement benefit costs, revenue recognition, goodwill, evaluation of equity method investments for other-than-temporary impairment, and income taxes.\nRegulatory Accounting (see Notes 10 & 11 to the consolidated financial statements) - The Utilities maintain their accounts according to the Uniform System of Accounts as prescribed by the BPU. As a result of the ratemaking process, the Utilities are required to follow ASC 980, Regulated Operations, which requires them to recognize the impact of regulatory decisions on their financial statements. The Utilities are required under their BGSS clauses to forecast their natural gas costs and customer consumption in setting their rates. Subject to regulator approval, they are able to recover or return the difference between gas cost recoveries and the actual costs of gas through a BGSS charge to customers. The Utilities record any over/under recoveries as a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets and reflect them in the BGSS charge to customers in subsequent years. The Utilities also enter into derivatives that are used to hedge natural gas purchases. The offset to the resulting derivative assets or liabilities is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDerivatives (see Notes 16 & 17 to the consolidated financial statements) - SJI recognizes assets or liabilities for contracts that qualify as derivatives that are entered into by its subsidiaries when such contracts are executed. We record contracts at their fair value in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. We record changes in the fair value of the effective portion of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges, net of tax, in AOCL and recognize such changes in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded in earnings in the current period. Currently we do not have any energy-related derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting has been discontinued for the remaining interest rate derivatives. As a result, unrealized gains and losses on these derivatives, that were previously recorded in AOCL on the consolidated balance sheets, are being recorded into earnings over the remaining life of the derivative.\nCounterparty credit risk and the credit risk of SJI, are incorporated and considered in the valuation of all derivative instruments, as appropriate. The effect of counterparty credit risk and the credit risk of SJI on the derivative valuations is not significant.\nCertain derivatives that result in the physical delivery of the commodity may meet the criteria to be accounted for as normal purchases and normal sales, if so designated, in which case the contract is not marked-to-market, but rather is accounted for when the commodity is delivered. Due to the application of regulatory GAAP, derivatives related to the Utilities' gas purchases that are marked-to-market are recorded through the BGSS. The Utilities periodically enter into financial derivatives to hedge against forward price risk. These derivatives are recorded at fair value with an offset to regulatory assets and liabilities through the BGSS, subject to BPU approval (see Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements). We adjust the fair value of the contracts each reporting period for changes in the market.\nAs discussed in Notes 16 and 17 of the consolidated financial statements, energy-related derivative instruments are traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. Exchange-based contracts are valued using unadjusted quoted market sources in active markets and are categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. Certain non-exchange-based contracts are valued using indicative price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges and are categorized in Level 2. These price quotations reflect the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices and are obtained from sources that management believes provide the most liquid market. Management reviews and corroborates the price quotations with at least one additional source to ensure the prices are observable market information, which includes consideration of actual transaction volumes, market delivery points, bid-ask spreads and contract duration. Derivative instruments that are used to limit our exposure to changes in interest rates on variable-rate, long-term debt are valued using quoted prices on commonly quoted intervals, which are interpolated for periods different than the quoted intervals, as inputs to a market valuation model. Market inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment, as a result, these instruments are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. For non-exchange-based derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs. In instances where observable data is unavailable, management considers the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility and contract duration. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the model inputs generally are not observable.\nManagement uses the discounted cash flow model to value Level 3 physical and financial forward contracts, which calculates mark-to-market valuations based on forward market prices, original transaction prices, volumes, risk-free rate of return and credit spreads. Inputs to the valuation model are reviewed and revised as needed, based on historical information, updated market data, market liquidity and relationships, and changes in third party pricing sources. The validity of the mark-to-market valuations and changes in these values from period to period are examined and qualified against historical expectations by the risk management function. If any discrepancies are identified during this process, the mark-to-market valuations or the market pricing information is evaluated further and adjusted, if necessary.\nLevel 3 valuation methods for natural gas derivative contracts include utilizing another location in close proximity adjusted for certain pipeline charges to derive a basis value. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of certain natural gas contracts consist of forward prices developed based on industry-standard methodologies. Significant increases (decreases) in these forward prices for purchases of natural gas would result in a directionally similar impact to the fair value measurement and for sales of natural gas would result in a directionally opposite impact to the fair value measurement. Level 3 valuation methods for electricity represent the value of the contract marked to the forward wholesale curve, as provided by daily exchange quotes for delivered electricity. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of electric contracts consist of fixed contracted electric load profiles; therefore, no change in unobservable inputs would occur. Unobservable inputs are updated daily using industry-standard techniques. Management reviews and corroborates the price quotations to ensure the prices are observable which includes consideration of actual transaction volumes, market delivery points, bid-ask spreads and contract duration.\nEnvironmental Remediation Costs (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements) - We estimate a range of future costs based on projected investigation and work plans using existing technologies. In preparing consolidated financial statements, SJI records liabilities for future costs using the lower end of the range because a single reliable estimation point is not feasible due to the amount of uncertainty involved in the nature of projected remediation efforts and the long period over which remediation efforts will continue. We update estimates each year to take into account past efforts, changes in work plans, remediation technologies, government regulations and site specific requirements.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Costs (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements) - The costs of providing pension and other postretirement employee benefits are impacted by actual plan experience as well as assumptions of future experience. Employee demographics, plan contributions, investment performance, and assumptions concerning mortality, return on plan assets, discount rates and health care cost trends all have a significant impact on determining our projected benefit obligations. We evaluate these assumptions annually and adjust them accordingly. These adjustments could result in significant changes to the net periodic benefit costs of providing such benefits and the related liabilities recognized by SJI.\nRevenue Recognition (see Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements) - Gas and electricity revenues are recognized in the period the commodity is delivered to customers. All SJI entities bill customers monthly. A majority of customers have their meters read on a cycle basis throughout the month. For retail customers (including SJG) that are not billed at the end of the month, we record an estimate to recognize unbilled revenues for gas/electricity delivered from the date of the last meter reading to the end of the month.\nUtility Revenue\nWe bill SJG and ETG customers at rates approved by the BPU.\nThe BPU allows the Utilities to recover gas costs in rates through the BGSS price structure. The Utilities defer over/under recoveries of gas costs and includes them in subsequent adjustments to the BGSS rate. These adjustments result in over/under recoveries of gas costs being included in rates during future periods. As a result of these deferrals, utility revenue recognition does not directly translate to profitability. While the Utilities realize profits on gas sales during the month of providing the utility service, significant shifts in revenue recognition may result from the various recovery clauses approved by the BPU. This revenue recognition process does not shift earnings between periods, as these clauses only provide for cost recovery on a dollar-for-dollar basis (see Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements).\nThe Utilities' unbilled revenue for natural gas is estimated each month based on monthly deliveries into the system; unaccounted for natural gas based on historical results; customer-specific use factors, when available; actual temperatures during the period; and applicable customer rates.\nThe Utilities also have revenues that arise from alternative revenue programs, which are discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.\nFor the Utilities, unrealized gains and losses on energy-related derivative instruments are recorded in Regulatory Assets or Regulatory Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets of SJI and SJG until they become realized, in which case they are recognized in operating revenues.\nNonutility Revenue\nSJE and SJRG customers are billed at rates negotiated between the parties.\nSJRG's gas revenues are recognized in the period the commodity is delivered. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on energy-related derivative instruments are also recognized in operating revenues for SJRG. SJRG presents revenues and expenses related to its energy trading activities on a net basis in Operating Revenues - Nonutility in the statements of consolidated income consistent with GAAP. This net presentation has no effect on operating income or net income.\nThe Company recognizes revenues on commissions received related to SJESP appliance service contracts, along with AEP and ECX energy procurement service contracts from a third party, on a monthly basis as the commissions are earned.\nMarina recognizes revenue for renewable energy projects when output is generated and delivered to the customer, and when renewable energy credits have been transferred to the third party at an agreed upon price.\nGoodwill (see Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements) - The segments that have goodwill are ETG Utility Operations and Corporate & Services. Goodwill represents future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration paid or transferred over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount.\nThe Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year beginning with a qualitative assessment at the reporting unit level. The reporting unit level is identified by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available, whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components and whether the economic and regulatory characteristics are similar. Factors utilized in the qualitative analysis performed on goodwill in our reporting units include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, company specific operating results and other relevant entity-specific events affecting individual reporting units.\nIf sufficient qualitative factors exist, potential goodwill impairment is evaluated quantitatively. Potential impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the book value, including goodwill. The Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis. Management also considers other methods, which includes a market multiples analysis. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, discount and growth rates, capital expenditures, tax rates, and projected terminal values.\nChanges in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. If the fair value exceeds book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the book value exceeds fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess up until the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2019, certain qualitative factors were present that required the Company to perform a quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment at March 31, 2020 related to the ETG reporting unit. The qualitative factors primarily included macroeconomic conditions related to COVID-19. During the third quarter of 2020, due to a decline in market conditions for gas distributors and our performance relative to the overall sector, the Company determined it necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment as of September 30, 2020 related to the ETG reporting unit. There were no impairments recorded as a result of either interim impairment test. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn preparing the goodwill impairment tests, the fair value of the reporting unit was calculated using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, capital expenditures, tax rates, projected terminal values and assumptions related to discount and growth rates, and implied market multiples for a selected group of peer companies. Based on the analysis performed, the fair value of the ETG reporting unit closely approached, but exceeded, its carrying amount. Should economic conditions deteriorate in future periods or remain depressed for a prolonged period of time, estimates of future cash flows and market valuation assumptions may not be sufficient to support the carrying value, requiring impairment charges in the future.\nEvaluation of Equity Method Investments for Other-Than-Temporary Impairment (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) - Our evaluation of impairment of equity method investments when conditions exist that could indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than book value includes key inputs that involve significant management judgments and estimates, including projections of the investment's cash flows, selection of a discount rate and probability weighting of potential outcomes of legal and regulatory proceedings and other available options.\nAs a result of the September 2019 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals and continuing events (see \"PennEast\" above), we evaluated our investment in the PennEast project for an other-than-temporary impairment. Our impairment assessment used a discounted cash flow income approach, including consideration of the severity and duration of any decline in fair value of our investment in the project. Our significant estimates and assumptions included development options and legal outcomes, construction costs, timing of in-service dates (which have been delayed from the initial timing assumed in our analysis as of December 31, 2019), revenues (including forecasted volumes and rates), and discount rates. At this time, we believe that we do not have an other-than-temporary impairment and have not recorded any impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our investment.\nOur evaluation also considered the current economic conditions as a result of COVID-19, noting that the timelines, potential options and legal proceedings have not been impacted. However, the legal and regulatory proceedings could have unfavorable outcomes, or there could be other future unfavorable developments, such as a reduced likelihood of success from development options and legal outcomes, estimated increases in construction costs, increases in the discount rate, or further significant delays, or PennEast could conclude that the project is not viable or does not go forward as actions progress. These could impact our conclusions with respect to other-than-temporary impairment and may require that we recognize an impairment charge of up to our recorded investment in the project, net of any cash and working capital.\nWe will continue to monitor and update this analysis as required. Different assumptions could affect the timing and amount of any charge recorded in a period.\nIncome Taxes - The determination of SJI's and SJG's provision for income taxes requires the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of tax laws. Judgment is required in assessing the deductibility and recoverability of certain tax benefits. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the Company's deferred tax assets will not be realized. Any significant changes to the estimates and judgments with respect to the interpretations, timing or deductibility could result in a material change to earnings and cash flows. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCOVID-19 - In March 2020, the World Health Organization classified the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic. The rapid spread has resulted in worldwide shutdowns and the halting of business and personal activity as governments around the world imposed regulations to control the spread of COVID-19. As a result, the global economy has been marked by significant slowdowns and uncertainty.\nOur business operations continue to function effectively during the pandemic. We are continuously evaluating the global pandemic and are taking necessary steps to mitigate known risks. We continue to closely monitor developments related to the pandemic and will adjust our actions and operations as appropriate in order to continue to provide safe and reliable service to our customers and communities while keeping employees safe. Although the impact to the operations of SJI and SJG has been minimal to date as discussed below, given the pandemic remains prevalent and the situation is evolving, the future impact on the business of SJI and SJG besides what is noted below is unknown. SJI and SJG provide critical and essential services to our customers and the health and safety of our employees and customers is our first priority. SJI and SJG considered the impact of COVID-19 on the use of estimates and assumptions used for financial reporting and noted there were no material impacts on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, as operations and delivery of product to our customers has not been materially impacted. To date, SJI has not experienced significant reductions in sales volumes across our businesses, and we do not anticipate any significant reductions in sales volumes going forward.\nSJI has been actively addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and has established a task force comprised of members of management, with the mission of ensuring the safety of individuals (customers and employees), while continuing to perform our daily responsibilities in an efficient and safe manner. SJI is following the guidance from federal, state and local authorities to help safeguard the health, safety and well-being of its employees. To date, all of our employees are currently working. The task force identified which roles are essential (i.e. need to work in field/office to conduct daily activities) and non-essential (i.e. able to perform work from a remote location) and developed a plan for all employees in non-essential roles to work remotely from home while ensuring that the appropriate safety measures are in place for all employees in essential roles in the field/office. These plans remain in place, as all employees in non-essential roles continue to work remotely. For employees in essential roles, safety measures include additional personal protective equipment and adjusting shifts to reduce the number of workers in close contact. Given the additional safety measures in place, and the ability for employees in non-essential roles to work remotely, we have not had a material impact on our operations as a result of these human capital constraints, and we do not believe operations will be materially impacted going forward by human capital constraints.\nIn order to initiate the business continuity plan, the Company has incurred operating costs for emergency supplies, cleaning services, enabling technology and other specific needs during the pandemic. SJI has incurred costs during 2020 of $2.2 million, with $0.6 million being recorded as Property, Plant & Equipment on the consolidated balance sheets, and the remaining $1.6 million recorded as Operations Expense on the consolidated statements of income. SJG has recorded $0.2 million of such costs, which are recorded as Property, Plant & Equipment on the balance sheets. Going forward, we expect further expenses for the above mentioned items; however, we do not anticipate these additional expenses to be material.\nThe supply chain has not been materially impacted by COVID-19; this is because the Company has a large inventory of standard products such as pipe material. In addition, given that the products are considered essential products, factories are remaining open, therefore allowing materials to be replenished. The Company is actively managing the materials, supplies and contract services necessary for our operations, and does not expect a disruption to the Company's gas supply in the future.\nOur infrastructure investment programs to replace and upgrade critical utility infrastructure continue to move forward. As a result of COVID-19, certain construction activity had been delayed due to some activity being ceased in accordance with directives from the Governor of New Jersey earlier in 2020. Construction activity has since resumed given the directive from the Governor was lifted. Our infrastructure investment programs continue to move forward; however, to the extent the pandemic worsens or a similar directive is put in place in the future for a long period of time, our capital projects could be significantly impacted.\nWe have considered the impact of COVID-19 on the liquidity position of the Company, and note that it has remained stable throughout this uncertain period, and that SJI's and SJG's ability to borrow has not been materially impacted to date. Further, SJI and SJG have successfully paid off and refinanced debt, and raised equity through the ATM offering, during 2020. In addition, SJI has continued to pay its quarterly dividend throughout 2020. See Liquidity and Capital resources section for a detailed description of borrowings entered into during the period.\nWe considered the impact the pandemic has had on operating revenues, noting that SJI and SJG have not seen a significant reduction in revenues as a result of the pandemic. This is due to gas and electricity being considered an essential service and continuing to be delivered timely to customers, and no delays or operational shutdowns taking place to date. Given the performance obligation is satisfied at delivery, which matches the time when the Company is able to invoice the customer, the Company is confident in being able to meet its future performance obligations. To the extent that the pandemic does impact our ability to deliver in the future, operating revenues could be impacted.\nAll accounts receivables are carried at the amount owed by customers. The provision for uncollectible accounts is established based on expected credit losses. On July 2, 2020, the BPU issued an Order authorizing New Jersey's regulated utilities to create a COVID-19-related regulatory asset by deferring on their books and records the prudently incurred incremental costs related to COVID-19 beginning on March 9, 2020 and continuing through September 30, 2021, or 60 days after the termination of the public health emergency, whichever is later. The Company will be required to file quarterly reports with the BPU, along with a petition for recovery of such incremental costs with the BPU by December 31, 2021 or within 60 days of the close of the tracking period, whichever is later. During the year ended December 31, 2020, ETG deferred $6.1 million and SJG deferred $4.8 million of incremental costs principally related to expected credit losses from uncollectibles as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically related to changes in payment patterns observed to date and consideration of macroeconomic factors. We have deemed these costs to be probable of recovery (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). The Utilities have suspended disconnects for nonpayment by our customers, based on orders and requests from our various regulators. These suspensions will go through at least March 15, 2021 based on an executive order issued by the Governor of New Jersey, in which water, gas and electricity providers are barred from cutting services to New Jersey residents.\nGiven the impact that COVID-19 has had on the economy, on March 27, 2020 the President signed into law the CARES Act, an economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, as a way to provide relief to both businesses and individuals affected by the virus. The CARES Act contains several corporate tax provisions that impacted SJI and SJG, including deferring payments on social security taxes for employees and other employee retention credits. These impacts of the CARES Act, and these provisions, did not have a material effect on income tax expense or deferred tax assets/liabilities.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting macroeconomic market conditions, the Company determined it necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis on the goodwill at the ETG reporting unit as of March 31, 2020, and again as of September 30, 2020. There were no impairments recorded as a result of either interim impairment test. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, along with \"Goodwill\" above.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - See discussions concerning New Accounting Pronouncements and their impact on SJI in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRATES AND REGULATION - The Utilities are subject to regulation by the BPU. Additionally, the Natural Gas Policy Act contains provisions for Federal regulation of certain aspects of the Utilities' business. The Utilities are affected by Federal regulation with respect to transportation and pricing policies applicable to pipeline capacity from Transco (both utilities' major supplier), Columbia and Dominion, since such services are provided under rates and terms established under the jurisdiction of the FERC. The Utilities' retail sales are made under rate schedules within a tariff filed with, and subject to the jurisdiction of, the BPU. These rate schedules provide primarily for either block rates or demand/commodity rate structures. The Utilities' primary rate mechanisms include base rates, the BGSS, Accelerated Infrastructure Programs, EET and the CIP for SJG, and BGSS and WNC for ETG.\nThe CIP is a BPU-approved program that is designed to eliminate the link between SJG profits and the quantity of natural gas SJG sells, and to foster conservation efforts. With the CIP, SJG's profits are tied to the number of customers served and how efficiently SJG serves them, thus allowing SJG to focus on encouraging conservation and energy efficiency among its customers without negatively impacting net income. The CIP tracking mechanism adjusts revenue based on weather, and also adjusts SJG's revenue when actual usage per customer experienced during an annual period varies from an established baseline usage per customer.\nEach CIP year begins October 1 and ends September 30 of the subsequent year. On a monthly basis during a CIP year, SJG records adjustments to revenue based on weather and customer usage factors, as incurred. Subsequent to each year, SJG makes filings with the BPU to review and approve amounts recorded under the CIP. BPU-approved cash inflows or outflows generally will not begin until the next CIP year and have no impact on revenue at that time.\nUtility revenue is recognized during current periods based upon the application of the CIP. The cash impact of variations in customer usage will result in cash being collected from, or returned to, customers during the subsequent CIP year, which runs from October 1 to September 30.\nThe effects of the CIP on SJG's net income for the last three years and the associated weather comparisons were as follows (in millions):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td>2019 </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income Impact: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CIP - Weather Related </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CIP - Usage Related </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.2) </td> <td> </td> <td>7.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Net Income Impact </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.6) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weather Compared to 20-Year Average </td> <td>12.5% warmer </td> <td>5.2% warmer </td> <td>183.0% colder </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weather Compared to Prior Year </td> <td>8.4% warmer </td> <td>2.6% warmer </td> <td>7.7% colder </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs part of the CIP, SJG is required to implement additional conservation programs, including customized customer communication and outreach efforts, targeted upgrade furnace efficiency packages, financing offers, and an outreach program to speak to local and state institutional constituents. SJG is also required to reduce gas supply and storage assets and their associated fees. Note that changes in fees associated with supply and storage assets have no effect on SJG's net income as these costs are passed through directly to customers on a dollar-for-dollar basis.\nEarnings accrued and payments received under the CIP are limited to a level that will not cause SJG's return on equity to exceed 9.6% (excluding earnings from off-system gas sales and certain other tariff clauses) and CIP recoveries are limited by the annualized savings attained from reducing gas supply and storage assets.\nFor ETG, the WNC is a BPU-approved program that is designed to recover or refund balances associated with differences between actual and normal weather during the preceding winter period(s). The effective winter period of the WNC is defined as October through May.\nIn 2020, ETG's net income was increased by $10.2 million, primarily due to warmer than average weather for the applicable months in the 2020 winter period. In 2019, ETG's net income was reduced by $5.9 million, primarily due to colder than average weather for the applicable months in the 2019 winter period.\nSee additional discussions on Rates and Regulatory Actions in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.\nENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION - See discussion concerning Environmental Remediation in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCOMPETITION - The Utilities' franchises are non-exclusive. Currently, no other utility provides retail gas distribution services within the Utilities territories, and we do not expect any other utilities to do so in the foreseeable future because of the extensive investment required for utility plant and related costs. The Utilities compete with oil, propane and electricity suppliers for residential, commercial and industrial users, with alternative fuel source providers (wind, solar and fuel cells) based upon price, convenience and environmental factors, and with other marketers/brokers in the selling of wholesale natural gas services. The market for natural gas commodity sales is subject to competition due to deregulation. SJG's competitive position was enhanced while maintaining margins by using an unbundled tariff. This tariff allows full cost-of-service recovery when transporting gas for SJG's customers. Under this tariff, SJG profits from transporting, rather than selling, the commodity. SJG's residential, commercial and industrial customers can choose their supplier, while SJG recovers the cost of service through transportation service (See Customer Choice Legislation below).\nSJRG competes in the wholesale natural gas market against a wide array of competitors on a cost competitive, term of service, and reliability basis. SJRG has been a reliable energy provider in this arena for more than 20 years.\nMarina competes with other companies that develop and operate similar types of on-site energy production. Marina also faces competition from customers' preferences for alternative technologies for energy production, as well as those customers that address their energy needs internally.\nCUSTOMER CHOICE LEGISLATION - All residential natural gas customers in New Jersey can choose their natural gas commodity supplier under the terms of the Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act of 1999.\" This bill created the framework and necessary time schedules for the restructuring of the state's electric and natural gas utilities. The Act established unbundling, where redesigned utility rate structures allow natural gas and electric consumers to choose their energy supplier. It also established time frames for instituting competitive services for customer account functions and for determining whether basic gas supply services should become competitive. Customers purchasing natural gas from a provider other than the local utility (the marketer\u201d) are charged for the gas costs by the marketer and charged for the transportation costs by the utility. The total number of customers in SJG's service territory purchasing natural gas from a marketer averaged 21,089, 22,216 and 25,665 during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The total number of customers in ETG's service territory purchasing natural gas from a marketer averaged 9,179 and 8,338 during 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS:\nFor information on the changes in results of operations from 2019 compared to 2018, refer to the Management Discussion & Analysis section in Item 7 of SJI's and SJG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSJI operates in several different reportable operating segments. These segments are as follows:\n\u2022SJG utility operations consist primarily of natural gas distribution to residential, commercial and industrial customers in southern New Jersey.\n\u2022ETG utility operations consist primarily of natural gas distribution to residential, commercial and industrial customers in northern and central New Jersey.\n\u2022ELK utility operations consist of natural gas distribution to residential, commercial and industrial customers in Maryland. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, on July 31, 2020, SJI sold ELK to a third-party buyer.\n\u2022Wholesale energy operations include the activities of SJRG and SJEX.\n\u2022Retail gas and other operations at SJE included natural gas acquisition and transportation service business lines. This business was sold on November 30, 2018 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022Retail electric operations at SJE consist of electricity acquisition and transportation to commercial, industrial and residential customers.\n\u2022On-site energy production consists of MTF and ACB, which were sold on February 18, 2020. This segment also includes other energy-related projects, including three legacy solar projects, one of which was sold during the first quarter of 2020. Also included in this segment are the activities of ACLE, BCLE, SCLE and SXLE. Operations at BCLE, SCLE, and SXLE ceased during the second quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, on-site energy production also includes newly acquired entities which own and operate solar-generation sites located in New Jersey, as well as the Catamaran joint venture, which owns Annadale (see Notes 1 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022Appliance service operations includes SJESP, which receives commissions on appliance service contracts from a third party.\n\u2022Midstream was formed to invest in infrastructure and other midstream projects, including an investment in PennEast.\n\u2022Corporate & Services segment includes costs related to acquisitions and divestitures, along with other unallocated costs. Also included in this segment are the results of SJEI and the assets related to our transactions with REV LNG (see Notes 3 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022Intersegment represents intercompany transactions among the above SJI consolidated entities.\nSJI groups its utility businesses under its wholly-owned subsidiary SJIU. This group consists of gas utility operations of SJG and ETG and, until its sale, ELK. SJI groups its nonutility operations into separate categories: Energy Group, Energy Services, Midstream and Corporate & Services. Energy Group includes wholesale energy, retail electric and, until its sale, retail gas and other operations. Energy Services includes on-site energy production and appliance service operations. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nSJI's net income for 2020 increased $80.1 million to $157.0 million compared to 2019. SJI's income from continuing operations for 2020 increased $80.1 million to $157.3 million compared to 2019. The significant drivers for the overall changes were as follows (all numbers in the bullet points below are presented after-tax):\n\u2022The income contribution from on-site energy production at Marina increased $24.0 million to $14.9 million, primarily due to ITC recorded on assets of recently acquired fuel cell and solar projects as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, along with the impact of impairment charges taken in 2019 that did not recur in 2020. These were partially offset with depreciation recorded on solar projects previously held for sale and the impact of less earnings from MTF/ACB due to its sale in February 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements)\n\u2022The income contribution from the wholesale energy operations at SJRG increased $23.9 million to $25.3 million, primarily due to higher margins on daily energy trading activities, along with a refund received from a third party supplier as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Also contributing to the increase was the change in unrealized gains and losses on forward financial contracts due to price volatility.\n\u2022The income contribution from gas utility operations at SJG increased $20.7 million to $108.1 million, primarily due to an increase in base rates as the BPU approved the settlement of SJG's rate case petition in September 2020 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), along with customer growth and the roll-in to rates of infrastructure program investments. SJG's utility margin also increased from its CIP mechanism as discussed in \"Utility Margin - SJG Utility Operations\" below. These were partially offset with increases in depreciation and maintenance expenses, along with a one-time tax adjustment resulting from SJG's Stipulation of Settlement with the BPU as part of its recent filing (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022The income contribution from the gas utility operations at ETG increased $13.5 million to $47.7 million, primarily due to positive margins due to favorable changes in base rates resulting from the completion of ETG's rate case in November 2019 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), along with customer growth and lower maintenance expenses. This was partially offset with higher operations and depreciation expenses.\n\u2022SJI incurred $2.5 million less severance and other employee separation costs during 2020 compared to 2019.\n\u2022Partially offsetting the above are items including:\n\u25e6Various tax items, most notably a state deferred tax valuation allowance (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u25e6A net increase in financing and interest costs at the SJI level (i.e. excluding SJG and ETG, as these are included in the income contributions noted above) during 2020 compared to 2019. These increases were primarily due to interest incurred on higher amounts of long-term debt outstanding, along with expenses incurred to terminate SJI's interest rate swaps (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). These increased costs were partially offset by changes in the mark-to-market valuations of SJI's interest rate swaps prior to termination in 2020.\nA significant portion of the volatility in operating results is due to the impact of the accounting methods associated with SJI's derivative activities. SJI uses derivatives to limit its exposure to market risk on transactions to buy, sell, transport and store natural gas and to buy and sell retail electricity. SJI also uses derivatives to limit its exposure to increasing interest rates on variable-rate debt.\nThe types of transactions that typically cause the most significant volatility in operating results are as follows:\n\u2022 The wholesale energy operations at SJRG purchases and holds natural gas in storage and maintains capacity on interstate pipelines to earn profit margins in the future. The wholesale energy operations utilize derivatives to mitigate price risk in order to substantially lock-in the profit margin that will ultimately be realized. However, both gas stored in inventory and pipeline capacity are not considered derivatives and are not subject to fair value accounting. Conversely, the derivatives used to reduce the risk associated with a change in the value of inventory and pipeline capacity are accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in operating results in the period of change. As a result, earnings are subject to volatility as the market price of derivatives change, even when the underlying hedged value of inventory and pipeline capacity are unchanged. Additionally, volatility in earnings is created when realized gains and losses on derivatives used to mitigate commodity price risk on expected future purchases of gas injected into storage are recognized in earnings when the derivatives settle, but the cost of the related gas in storage is not recognized in earnings until the period of withdrawal. This volatility can be significant from period to period.\nOver time, gains or losses on the sale of gas in storage, as well as use of capacity, will be offset by losses or gains on the derivatives, resulting in the realization of the profit margin expected when the transactions were initiated.\n\u2022 The retail electric operations at SJE use forward contracts to mitigate commodity price risk on fixed price electric contracts with customers. In accordance with GAAP, the forward contracts are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings in the period of change. Several related customer contracts are not considered derivatives and, therefore, are not recorded in earnings until the electricity is delivered. As a result, earnings are subject to volatility as the market price of the forward contracts change, even when the underlying hedged value of the customer contract is unchanged. Over time, gains or losses on the sale of the fixed price electric under contract will be offset by losses or gains on the forward contracts, resulting in the realization of the profit margin expected when the transactions were initiated.\nAs a result, management also uses the non-GAAP financial measures of Economic Earnings and Economic Earnings Per Share when evaluating its results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP measures, such as net income, operating income, earnings per share from continuing operations or any other GAAP measure of financial performance.\nWe define Economic Earnings as: Income from Continuing Operations, (i) less the change in unrealized gains and plus the change in unrealized losses on non-utility derivative transactions; (ii) less income and plus losses attributable to noncontrolling interest; and (iii) less the impact of transactions, contractual arrangements or other events where management believes period to period comparisons of SJI's operations could be difficult or potentially confusing. With respect to part (iii) of the definition of Economic Earnings, items excluded from Economic Earnings for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, include impairment charges; the impact of pricing disputes with third parties; costs to acquire ETG and ELK; costs incurred and gains recognized on the acquisitions of Annadale (fuel cell projects) and EnerConnex; costs to prepare to exit the transaction service agreement (TSA); costs incurred and gains/losses recognized on sales of solar, MTF/ACB, ELK and SJE's retail gas business; costs incurred to cease operations at three landfill gas-to-energy production facilities; customer credits related to the acquisition of ETG and ELK; ERIP costs; severance and other employee separation costs; and additional tax adjustments including a state deferred valuation allowance and a one-time tax expense resulting from SJG's Stipulation of Settlement with the BPU. See (A)-(H) in the table below.\nEconomic Earnings is a significant financial measure used by our management to indicate the amount and timing of income from continuing operations that we expect to earn after taking into account the impact of derivative instruments on the related transactions, as well as the impact of contractual arrangements and other events that management believes make period to period comparisons of SJI's operations difficult or potentially confusing. Management uses Economic Earnings to manage its business and to determine such items as incentive/compensation arrangements and allocation of resources. Specifically regarding derivatives, we believe that this financial measure indicates to investors the profitability of the entire derivative-related transaction and not just the portion that is subject to mark-to-market valuation under GAAP. We believe that considering only the change in market value on the derivative side of the transaction can produce a false sense as to the ultimate profitability of the total transaction as no change in value is reflected for the non-derivative portion of the transaction.\nEconomic Earnings for 2020 increased $59.9 million, or 58.2%, to $163.0 million compared to 2019. The significant drivers for the overall change were as follows (all numbers in the bullet points below are presented after-tax):\n\u2022The Economic Earnings contribution from gas utility operations at SJG increased $21.9 million to $109.3 million, primarily due to an increase in base rates as the BPU approved the settlement of SJG's rate case petition in September 2020 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), along with customer growth and the roll-in to rates of infrastructure program investments. SJG's utility margin also increased from its CIP mechanism as discussed in \"Utility Margin - SJG Utility Operations\" below. These were partially offset with increases in depreciation and maintenance expenses,\n\u2022The Economic Earnings contribution from on-site energy production at Marina increased $18.1 million to $15.7 million, primarily due to ITC recorded on assets of recently acquired fuel cell and solar projects as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. These were partially offset with depreciation recorded on solar projects previously held for sale and the impact of less earnings from MTF/ACB due to its sale in February 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022The Economic Earnings contribution from the wholesale energy operations at SJRG increased $16.0 million to $24.8 million, primarily due to higher margins on daily energy trading activities, along with a refund received from a third party supplier as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022The Economic Earnings contribution from gas utility operations at ETG increased $13.5 million to $47.7 million, primarily due to positive margins due to favorable changes in base rates resulting from the completion of ETG's rate case in November 2019 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), along with customer growth and lower maintenance expenses. This was partially offset with higher operations and depreciation expenses.\n\u2022Partially offsetting the above items is a $7.3 million increase in financing and interest costs at the SJI level (i.e. excluding SJG and ETG, as these are included in the Economic Earnings contributions noted above) during 2020 compared to 2019. These were primarily due to interest incurred on higher amounts of long-term debt outstanding, along with expenses incurred to terminate SJI's interest rate swaps (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our income from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations to Economic Earnings and Economic

Interest Charges on the consolidated statements of income.\n(B) Represents pass-through expenses for which there is a corresponding credit in operating revenues. Therefore, such recoveries have no impact on SJG's financial results.\n(C) Utility Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure and is further defined under the caption \"Utility Margin - SJG Utility Operations\" below.\nOperating Revenues - SJG Utility Operations 2020 vs. 2019 - Revenues increased $2.6 million, or 0.4%, during 2020 compared with 2019. Excluding intercompany transactions, revenues increased $0.5 million, or 0.1%, during 2020 compared with 2019.\nThe main driver for the increased revenue was higher firm sales primarily due to customer growth and increase in base rates, partially offset by warmer weather in the first quarter of 2020. While changes in gas costs and BGSS recoveries/refunds fluctuate from period to period, SJG does not profit from the sale of the commodity. Therefore, corresponding fluctuations in Operating Revenue or Cost of Sales have no impact on profitability, as further discussed below under the caption \"Utility Margin.\"\nPartially offsetting these increases was the impact of decreased OSS, which was primarily due to lower commodity costs as a result of lower cash market prices and lower demand, along with warmer weather during the first quarter of 2020. However, the impact of changes in OSS and capacity release activity do not have a material impact on the earnings of SJG, as SJG is required to return the majority of the profits of such activity to its ratepayers.\nUtility Margin - SJG Utility Operations 2020 vs. 2019 - Management uses Utility Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, when evaluating the operating results of SJG. Utility Margin is defined as natural gas revenues plus depreciation and amortization expenses, less natural gas costs, regulatory rider expenses and related volumetric and revenue-based energy taxes. Management believes that Utility Margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than revenues since natural gas costs, regulatory rider expenses and related energy taxes are passed through to customers, and since depreciation and amortization expenses are considered to be administrative. Natural gas costs are charged to operating expenses on the basis of therm sales at the prices approved by the BPU through SJG's BGSS clause. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP measure.\nUtility Margin increased $30.2 million, or 9.5 %, during 2020 compared with 2019. The twelve-month comparative period increase is primarily due to increases in base rates as the BPU approved the settlement of SJG's rate case petition in September 2020 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), along with customer growth and the roll-in to rates of infrastructure program investments Also contributing to the comparative period increase was the CIP tracking mechanism, which adjusts earnings when actual usage per customer experienced during the period varies from an established baseline usage per customer. As reflected in the Utility Margin table above, the CIP mechanism increased Utility Margin in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to variation in customer usage compared to the prior year.\nETG Utility Operations:\nThe following tables summarize the composition of regulated natural gas utility operations, operating revenues and margin at ETG for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and for the post-acquisition period during 2018, which was July 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 (\"post-acquisition period\") (in thousands, except for degree day data):\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utility Operating Revenues: </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020 </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019 </td> <td>July 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Firm & Interruptible Sales - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential </td> <td>$ </td> <td>229,188 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>211,639 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,215 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial & Industrial </td> <td>73,712 </td> <td> </td> <td>66,769 </td> <td> </td> <td>26,784 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Firm & Interruptible Transportation - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential </td> <td>1,654 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,632 </td> <td> </td> <td>508 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial & Industrial </td> <td>43,229 </td> <td> </td> <td>34,846 </td> <td> </td> <td>15,148 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>1,610 </td> <td> </td> <td>10,242 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,949 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Firm & Interruptible Revenues </td> <td>349,393 </td> <td> </td> <td>325,128 </td> <td> </td> <td>125,604 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Total Cost of Sales - Utility (Excluding Depreciation & Amortization) (A) </td> <td>120,798 </td> <td> </td> <td>141,269 </td> <td> </td> <td>53,491 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Depreciation & Amortization (A) </td> <td>56,772 </td> <td> </td> <td>29,051 </td> <td> </td> <td>13,580 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total GAAP Gross Margin </td> <td>171,823 </td> <td> </td> <td>154,808 </td> <td> </td> <td>58,533 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Depreciation & Amortization (A) </td> <td>56,772 </td> <td> </td> <td>29,051 </td> <td> </td> <td>13,580 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Regulatory Rider Expenses (B) </td> <td>16,204 </td> <td> </td> <td>7,989 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,068 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utility Margin (C) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>212,391 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>175,870 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,045 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utility Margin: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,230 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>110,519 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,293 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial & Industrial </td> <td>86,851 </td> <td> </td> <td>63,605 </td> <td> </td> <td>26,034 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory Rider Expenses (B) </td> <td>(13,690) </td> <td> </td> <td>1,746 </td> <td> </td> <td>718 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utility Margin (C) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>212,391 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>175,870 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,045 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Degree Days </td> <td>4,191 </td> <td>4,672 </td> <td>1,724 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(A) Does not include amortization of debt issuance costs that are recorded as Interest Charges on the consolidated statements of income.\n(B) Represents pass-through expenses for which there is a corresponding credit in operating revenues. Therefore, such recoveries have no impact on ETG's financial results.\n(C) Utility Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure and is further defined under the caption \"Utility Margin - SJG Utility Operations\" above. The definition of Utility Margin is the same for each of the Utilities.\nETG consists of natural gas distribution to residential, commercial and industrial customers in northern and central New Jersey. ETG's operating revenues consist of firm sales and transportation, as well as interruptible sales and transportation. ETG does not have any off-system sales. The Utility Margin at ETG is considered a non-GAAP measure and calculated the same as SJG as discussed under \"Utility Margin\" above.\nRevenues from the gas utility operations at ETG increased $24.3 million, or 7.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. ETG Utility Margin increased $36.5 million, or 20.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. These increases in revenues and Utility Margin compared to the prior year periods are primarily due to favorable changes in base rates resulting from the completion of ETG's rate case in November 2019, along with customer growth.\nELK Utility Operations - The activities of ELK utility operations are not material to SJI's financial results. On July 31, 2020, SJI, through its wholly-owned subsidiary SJIU, closed on its transaction to sell ELK to a third-party buyer. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Revenues - Energy Group 2020 vs. 2019 - Combined revenues for Energy Group, net of intercompany transactions, decreased $78.2 million, or 11.4%, to $604.8 million, in 2020 compared with 2019. The significant drivers for the overall change were as follows:\n\u2022Revenues from retail electric operations at SJE, net of intercompany transactions, decreased $42.5 million to $33.4 million, primarily due to lower overall sales volumes as SJE chose not to renew several contracts that have expired over the last twelve months. Partially offsetting this decrease was the change in unrealized gains and losses recorded on forward financial contracts due to price volatility, which is excluded for Economic Earnings and represented a total increase of $3.8 million.\nSJE uses forward financial contracts to mitigate commodity price risk on fixed price electric contracts. In accordance with GAAP, the forward financial contracts are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings in the period of change. The related customer contracts are not considered derivatives and, therefore, are not recorded in earnings until the electricity is delivered. As a result, earnings are subject to volatility as the market price of the forward financial contracts change, even when the underlying hedged value of the customer contract is unchanged. Over time, gains or losses on the sale of the fixed price electric under contract will be offset by losses or gains on the forward financial contracts, resulting in the realization of the profit margin expected when the transactions were initiated. The retail electric operations at SJE serve both fixed and market-priced customers.\n\u2022Revenues from wholesale energy operations at SJRG, net of intercompany transactions, decreased $35.8 million to $571.1 million, primarily due to decreases in the average monthly NYMEX settle price, along with maintenance and scheduled outages at several electric generation facilities during the first quarter of 2020. These decreases were partially offset by higher margins on daily energy trading activities, as well as revenues earned on gas supply contracts with two electric generation facilities that began operating in 2020. Also impacting the comparative period revenues was the change in unrealized gains and losses recorded on forward financial contracts due to price volatility, which is excluded for Economic Earnings and represented a total increase of $8.5 million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues and expenses related to the energy trading activities of the wholesale energy operations at SJRG are presented on a net basis in Operating Revenues - Nonutility on the consolidated statement of income.\nOperating Revenues - Energy Services 2020 vs. 2019 - Combined revenues for Energy Services, net of intercompany transactions, decreased $31.9 million, or 66.3%, to $16.2 million in 2020 compared with 2019. The significant drivers for the overall change were as follows:\n\u2022Revenues from on-site energy production at Marina, net of intercompany transactions, decreased $31.9 million to $14.2 million, primarily due to lack of revenues from MTF and ACB subsequent to the sale that was completed February 18, 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022The change in revenues from appliance service operations at SJESP, net of intercompany transactions, was not significant.\nGross Margin - Energy Group & Energy Services - Gross margin for the Energy Group and Energy Services businesses is a GAAP measure and is defined as revenue less all costs that are directly related to the production, sale and delivery of SJI's products and services. These costs primarily include natural gas and electric commodity costs as well as certain payroll and related benefits. On the statements of consolidated income, revenue is reflected in Operating Revenues - Nonutility and the costs are reflected in Cost of Sales - Nonutility. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues and expenses related to the energy trading activities of the wholesale energy operations at SJRG are presented on a net basis in Operating Revenues - Nonutility on the statements of consolidated income.\nGross margin is broken out between Energy Group and Energy Services below, which are each comprised of a group of segments as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nGross Margin - Energy Group 2020 vs. 2019 - Combined gross margins for Energy Group increased $34.2 million to $43.9 million for 2020 compared with 2019. The significant drivers for the overall change were as follows:\n\u2022Gross margin from the wholesale energy operations at SJRG increased $32.9 million to $44.1 million, primarily due to higher margins on daily energy trading activities. Also contributing to the increase was a refund received from a third party gas supplier as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, as well as the change in unrealized gains and losses recorded on forward financial contracts due to price volatility, which is excluded for Economic Earnings and represented a total increase of $8.5 million.\nWe expect the wholesale energy operations at SJRG to continue to add incremental margin from marketing and related opportunities in the Marcellus region, capitalizing on its established presence in the area. Future margins could fluctuate significantly due to the volatile nature of wholesale gas prices. As of December 31, 2020, the wholesale energy operations had 4.6 MMdts of storage and 423,030 dts/d of transportation under contract.\n\u2022Gross margin from SJE's retail electric operations increased $1.1 million to a loss of $0.4 million, primarily due to the change in unrealized gains and losses recorded on forward financial contracts due to price volatility, which is excluded for Economic Earnings and represented a total increase of $3.8 million. Partially offsetting this increase is overall lower sales volumes as SJE did not renew several contracts that have expired over the last twelve months.\nGross Margin - Energy Services 2020 vs. 2019 - Combined gross margins for Energy Services decreased $25.1 million to $15.9 million for 2020 compared with 2019. The significant drivers for the overall change were as follows:\n\u2022Gross margin from on-site energy production at Marina decreased $25.1 million to $13.9 million, primarily due to lack of margin from MTF and ACB subsequent to the sale that was completed February 18, 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022The change in gross margin from appliance service operations at SJESP was not significant.\nOperations Expense - All Segments - A summary of net changes in operations expense follows (in thousands):\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> <td>2019 vs. 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SJI Utilities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> SJG Utility Operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>352 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,282) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> ETG Utility Operations </td> <td>13,965 </td> <td> </td> <td>23,681 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> ELK Utility Operations </td> <td>(693) </td> <td> </td> <td>812 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Subtotal SJI Utilities </td> <td>13,624 </td> <td> </td> <td>20,211 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Energy Group: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Wholesale Energy Operations </td> <td>(363) </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,080) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Retail Gas and Other Operations </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,272) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Retail Electric Operations </td> <td>(160) </td> <td> </td> <td>1,148 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Subtotal Energy Group </td> <td>(523) </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,204) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Energy Services: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> On-Site Energy Production </td> <td>(16,151) </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,633) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Appliance Service Operations </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> <td>(210) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Subtotal Energy Services </td> <td>(16,082) </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,843) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Midstream </td> <td>313 </td> <td> </td> <td>(138) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate & Services and Intercompany Eliminations </td> <td>(2,770) </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,136) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total Operations Expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,438) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18,110) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe change in SJG utility operations expense in 2020 compared with 2019 was not significant.\nETG utility operations expense increased $14.0 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to the operation of ETG's RAC, which experienced an aggregate net increase. Such costs are recovered on a dollar-for-dollar basis; therefore, ETG experienced an offsetting increase in revenue compared with the prior year. Also contributing to the increase was higher expenses in various areas, most notably those associated with corporate support.\nCombined operations expense for Energy Group and Energy Services decreased $16.6 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to the sale of MTF and ACB (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nThe Corporate & Services segment had a $2.8 million decrease in Operations Expense in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to less severance and other employee separation costs and less costs incurred to exit the TSA, which occurred in March 2020, along with intercompany eliminations. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in operations expense at SJEI due to the acquisitions of AEP and EnerConnex (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nImpairment Charges - No impairment charges were recorded during 2020. Marina incurred approximately $10.8 million of impairment charges during 2019 related to the expected purchase price of two of the unsold solar sites being less than their carrying value, along with charges resulting from the purchase price in the agreement to sell MTF and ACB being less than its carrying value (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). These impairment charges were recorded in the On-Site Energy Production segment.\nMaintenance Expense - Maintenance expense increased $1.5 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to increased maintenance of services activity and higher levels of RAC amortization at SJG. This increase in RAC-related expenses does not affect earnings, as SJG recognizes an offsetting amount in revenues. This increase at SJG was partially offset by lower repair expenses at ETG in 2020 compared with 2019.\nDepreciation Expense - Depreciation expense increased $19.0 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to increased investment in property, plant and equipment by the gas utility operations of SJG and ETG, along with depreciation recorded on solar projects previously held for sale. This was partially offset by the MTF & ACB sale (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nEnergy and Other Taxes - The change in Energy and Other Taxes in 2020 compared with 2019 was not significant.\nNet Gain on Sales of Assets - During 2020, the Company recognized $1.1 million in net gains on the sale of MTF and ACB, $0.8 million on the sale of assets related to solar projects and $0.7 million on the sale of ELK. During 2019, the Company recognized $3.1 million in net gains on the sale of assets related to solar projects, with these gains pertaining to those projects that were not impaired as discussed above. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOther Income and Expense - Other income and expense increased $3.8 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to the step acquisition gain recorded in connection with the EnerConnex acquisition (see Notes 1 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements), along with higher AFUDC income at SJG and ETG.\nInterest Charges - Interest charges increased $4.1 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to interest incurred on higher amounts of long-term debt outstanding at SJI and SJG.\nIncome Taxes - Income tax expense increased $1.6 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes in 2020 compared with the prior year along with a state deferred tax valuation allowance recorded (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). These were partially offset with the benefits from ITC recorded on the assets of recently acquired fuel cell and solar projects that commenced operations in 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nEquity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies - The change in equity in earnings of affiliated companies in 2020 compared with 2019 was not significant.\nDiscontinued Operations - The losses are primarily comprised of environmental remediation and product liability litigation associated with previously disposed of businesses.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES:\nFor information on the changes in liquidity and capital resources from 2019 compared to 2018, refer to the Management Discussion & Analysis section in Item 7 of SJI's and SJG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity needs are driven by factors that include natural gas commodity prices; the impact of weather on customer bills; lags in fully collecting gas costs from customers under the BGSS charge and other regulatory clauses; settlement of legal matters; environmental remediation expenditures through the RAC; working capital needs of SJI's energy trading and marketing activities; the timing of construction and remediation expenditures and related permanent financings; the timing of equity contributions to unconsolidated affiliates; mandated tax payment dates; both discretionary and required repayments of long-term debt; acquisitions; and the amounts and timing of dividend payments.\nCash flows for the years ended December 31, were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>311,639 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,052 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>143,583 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Used in Investing Activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(507,751) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(477,648) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,788,785) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>209,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>353,298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,637,186 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities - Liquidity needs are first met with net cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities varies from year-to-year primarily due to the impact of weather on customer demand and related gas purchases, customer usage factors related to conservation efforts and the price of the natural gas commodity, inventory utilization, and gas cost recoveries. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2020 produced more net cash than 2019, primarily due to the following: (1) cash payments related to a legal proceeding of a pricing dispute which were paid during 2019 and did not recur in 2020 (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements); (2) a refund from a third party gas supplier that was received in July 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements); (3) higher ETG revenues due to favorable changes in base rates resulting from the completion of ETG's rate case in November 2019 (see \"ETG Utility Operations\"); (4) higher margins and increased collections on daily energy trading activities at SJRG; and (5) customer growth and lower costs experienced at SJG for environmental remediation. These increases were partially offset by SJI terminating its interest rate swaps in December 2020 at a price of $8.2 million (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\nCash Flows from Investing Activities - SJI has a continuing need for cash resources and capital, primarily to invest in new and replacement facilities and equipment. We estimate the cash outflows for investing activities, net of refinancings and returns/advances on investments from affiliates, for 2021, 2022 and 2023 to be approximately $686.4 million, $625.1 million and $624.8 million, respectively. The high level of investing activities for 2021, 2022 and 2023 is due to the accelerated infrastructure investment programs and future capital expenditures at SJG and ETG, projected investment in PennEast, and investments in future renewable energy projects. SJI expects to use short-term borrowings under lines of credit from commercial banks and a commercial paper program to finance these investing activities as incurred. From time to time, SJI may refinance the short-term debt with long-term debt.\nOther significant investing activities of SJI during 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n\u2022In 2020, SJI received approximately $119.8 million in total from the sales of MTF and ACB, ELK and a solar project. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022In 2020, SJI paid approximately $21.6 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of EnerConnex, the renewable natural gas development rights in certain dairy farms and four solar LLCs. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022In 2020, SJI paid $80.2 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire a 93% ownership interest in Annadale. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022SJI made net investments in unconsolidated affiliates of $28.9 million, $8.3 million and $6.6 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Included in 2020 is SJI's acquisition of its 35% ownership interest in REV LNG and capital contribution loans made to REV LNG. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022SJI received approximately $26.8 million and $310.6 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, from the sale of certain solar assets along with the sale of SJE's retail gas operations (2018). See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022In 2019, SJI received $15.6 million as an adjustment to the purchase price related to the ETG/ELK Acquisition.\n\u2022In 2019, SJI paid $4.0 million to acquire AEP. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022In 2018, SJI paid $11.3 million to enter into a new asset management agreement. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022In 2018, SJI paid approximately $1.7 billion for the ETG/ELK Acquisition. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities - SJI supplements its operating cash flow, commercial paper program and credit lines with both debt and equity capital to support working capital needs and to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions as incurred.\nSJG has a commercial paper program under which SJG may issue short-term, unsecured promissory notes to qualified investors up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $200.0 million. The notes have fixed maturities which vary by note, but may not exceed 270 days from the date of issue. Proceeds from the notes are used for general corporate purposes. SJG uses the commercial paper program in tandem with its $200.0 million revolving credit facility and the principal amount of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the credit facility cannot exceed an aggregate of $200.0 million.\nOver the years, SJG has used long-term debt, primarily in the form of First Mortgage Bonds and MTN's, secured by the same pool of utility assets, to finance its long-term borrowing needs. These needs are primarily capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment.\nCredit facilities and available liquidity as of December 31, 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>Usage </td> <td> </td> <td>Available Liquidity </td> <td> </td> <td>Expiration Date </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SJI: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> SJI Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>334,600 </td> <td> </td> <td>(A) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>165,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>August 2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Term Loan Credit Agreement </td> <td> </td> <td>150,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>March 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total SJI </td> <td> </td> <td>650,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>484,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>165,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SJG: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Commercial Paper Program/Revolving Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>200,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,300 </td> <td> </td> <td>(B) </td> <td>151,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>August 2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Uncommitted Bank Line </td> <td> </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>September 2021 (D) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total SJG </td> <td> </td> <td>210,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>161,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ETG/SJIU: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> ETG/SJIU Revolving Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>200,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,900 </td> <td> </td> <td>(C) </td> <td>125,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>April 2022 (D) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,060,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>607,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>452,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(A) Includes letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $9.6 million, which is used to enable SJE to market retail electricity as well as for various construction and operating activities.\n(B) Includes letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $0.8 million, which supports the remediation of environmental conditions at certain locations in SJG's service territory.\n(C) Includes letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $1.0 million, which supports ETG's construction activity.\n(D) These facilities were renewed in 2020.\nFor SJI and SJG, the amount of usage shown in the table above, less the letters of credit noted in (A)-(C) for SJI and (B) only for SJG above, equals the amounts recorded as Notes Payable on the respective consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020.\nBased upon the existing credit facilities and a regular dialogue with our banks, we believe there will continue to be sufficient credit available to meet our business' future liquidity needs.\nEach of the credit facilities are provided by a syndicate of banks. The NPA for Senior Unsecured Notes issued by SJI, and the Utilities' credit facilities, contain a financial covenant limiting the ratio of indebtedness to total capitalization (as defined in the respective NPA or credit agreement) to not more than 0.70 to 1, measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. SJI and the Utilities were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2020. For SJI, the equity units are treated as equity (as opposed to how they are classified on the consolidated balance sheet, as long-term debt; see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements) for purposes of the covenant calculation.\nAlthough there can be no assurance, management believes that actions presently being taken to pay off or refinance the short-term debt and borrowings that are due within the next year will be successful, as the Company has been successful in refinancing debt in the past. No adjustments have been made to the financial statements to account for this uncertainty.\nFor additional information regarding the terms of the credit facilities as well as weighted average interest rates, average borrowings outstanding and maximum amounts outstanding under these credit facilities see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOther Financing Activity - 2020\nDebt Issuances/Paydowns:\nOn March 26, 2020, SJI entered into an unsecured $150.0 million term loan agreement, which bears interest at variable rates. The maturity date of the term loan is March 25, 2021, and the loan is recorded in Notes Payable on the consolidated balance sheets. The proceeds of the loan were used for general corporate purposes.\nOn April 3, 2020, SJI entered into an unsecured $200.0 million term loan credit agreement, which bears interest at variable rates. Proceeds from the debt were used to pay down the following:\n\u2022$50.0 million outstanding on the SJI revolving credit facility, which was previously recorded in Notes Payable on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\u2022$100.0 million SJI Term Loan, which was previously recorded in Notes Payable on the consolidated balance sheets and due to mature in September 2020.\n\u2022$50.0 million SJI variable rate note, which was previously recorded in current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOn April 16, 2020, SJG entered into a NPA which provided for SJG to issue and sell its Senior Secured Notes, Series F, 2020 in the aggregate principal amount of $525.0 million in three Tranches; Tranche A and B totaled $400.0 million and were issued on April 16, 2020 while Tranche C of $125.0 million was issued on October 1, 2020. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. On April 26, 2020, SJG used proceeds from Tranche A and B to pay off $400.0 million principal amount outstanding on its term loan credit agreement, which was previously recorded in current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. SJG used the Tranche C proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nOn May 27, 2020, SJI entered into a NPA which provided for the Company to issue an aggregate of $200.0 million of senior unsecured notes in two tranches, both of which were issued on July 30, 2020. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. The proceeds from these issuances were used to pay off the unsecured $200.0 million term loan credit agreement issued in April 2020 discussed above, which was paid off on July 31, 2020.\nIn September 2020, SJG paid off $10.0 million of the principal balance outstanding on its 3.00% MTNs. In November 2020, SJG paid off $7.0 million of the principal balance outstanding on its 3.03% MTNs.\nSJG makes payments of $0.9 million annually through December 2025 toward the principal amount of 3.63% MTNs, including a payment made in 2020.\nOn November 10, 2020, ETG entered into a Bond Purchase Agreement which provided for ETG to issue an aggregate of $250.0 million of first mortgage bonds in 5 tranches. The first two tranches totaled $125.0 million and were issued on November 10, 2020, while the final three tranches totaling $125.0 million are expected to be issued on June 15, 2021. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\nEquity Activity:\nIn April 2020, SJI entered into an ATM Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the \"Sales Agreement\") to sell, from time to time, shares of the Company's common stock, par value $1.25 per share, having an aggregate sale price up to $200.0 million, through an at-the-market\u201d equity offering program. Pursuant to the Sales Agreement, the shares of common stock were to be offered and sold through any of the named sales agents in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be at-the-market\u201d offerings. In June 2020, 8,122,283 shares were sold pursuant to the Sales Agreement at an average market price of approximately $24.62 for total net proceeds of $198.0 million after deducting commissions and other general & administrative expenses. These sales exhausted the shares that were available for sale under the Sales Agreement. The Company is using the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes.\nOn October 16, 2020, SJI filed an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation that increased the authorized number of shares of its common stock from 120,000,000 to 220,000,000 and the aggregate number of shares authorized to be issued by SJI from 122,500,000 to 222,500,000.\nOther Financing Activity - 2019\nProceeds from the Sale of Common Stock\nSJI settled its equity forward sale agreement (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements) by delivering 6,779,661 shares of common stock and receiving net cash proceeds of approximately $189.0 million. The forward price used to determine cash proceeds received by SJI at settlement was calculated based on the initial forward sale price, as adjusted for underwriting fees, interest rate adjustments as specified in the equity forward agreement and any dividends paid on our common stock during the forward period.\nDebt Issuances:\nSJI offered and sold $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.625% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2079. The total net cash proceeds, inclusive of a debt discount of $5.3 million, were $194.7 million.\nETG entered into a Bond Purchase Agreement and issued First Mortgage Bonds, Series 2019A-1 through Series 2019A-4, in the aggregate principal amount of $145.0 million. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2019, SJG borrowed $400.0 million on its term loan credit agreement, including borrowing the remaining $90.0 million (which was available as of December 31, 2018) in 2019. All loans under this term loan credit agreement were paid on April 26, 2020 as noted above.\nDebt Repayments:\nSJI repaid $475.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding on its Floating Rate Senior Notes, Series 2018D.\nSJI paid off the following: $60.0 million principal amount outstanding on its 3.30% Senior Notes, Series 2014A-1; $40.0 million principal amount outstanding on its Floating Rate Senior Notes, Series 2014B-1; $30.0 million principal amount outstanding on its 3.30% Senior Notes, Series 2014A-2; $50.0 million principal amount outstanding on its 3.30% Senior Notes, Series 2014A-3; and $60.0 million principal amount outstanding on its Floating Rate Senior Notes, Series 2014B-2.\nSJG retired $10.0 million of 5.587% MTN's.\nSJG paid $8.0 million in November 2019 that was due on its 4.01% MTN's,\nDRP - See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE - SJI's capital structure was as follows:\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity </td> <td>32.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>29.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt </td> <td>56.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>52.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-Term Debt </td> <td>11.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>17.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, SJI paid quarterly dividends to its common shareholders. SJI has a long history of paying dividends on its common stock and has increased its dividend every year since 1999. SJI's current long-term goals are to grow the dividend at a rate consistent with earnings growth over the long term, subject to the approval of its Board of Directors, with a long-term targeted payout ratio of between 55% and 65% of Economic Earnings. In setting the dividend rate, the Board of Directors of SJI considers future earnings expectations, payout ratio, and dividend yield relative to those at peer companies, as well as returns available on other income-oriented investments. However, there can be no assurance that SJI will be able to continue to increase the dividend, meet the targeted payout ratio or pay a dividend at all in the future.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:\nENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION - Costs for remediation projects, net of recoveries from ratepayers, for 2020, 2019 and 2018 amounted to net cash outflows of $19.3 million, $49.2 million and $59.3 million, respectively. These include environmental remediation liabilities of ETG associated with five former manufactured gas plant sites in New Jersey which are recoverable from customers through rate mechanisms approved by the BPU. See the Contractual Cash Obligations Table below for the total expected net cash outflows for remediation projects for future years. As discussed in Notes 10, 11 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, certain environmental costs are subject to recovery from ratepayers.\nSTANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT - See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCONVERTIBLE UNITS - The Company has a contract obligating the holder of the units to purchase from the Company, and for the Company to sell to the holder for a price in cash of $50, a certain number of shares of common stock. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS - SJG and SJRG have certain commitments for both pipeline capacity and gas supply for which they pay fees regardless of usage. Those commitments as of December 31, 2020, average $96.7 million annually and total $760.5 million over the contracts' lives. Approximately 38% of the financial commitments under these contracts expire during the next five years. These contracts are included in SJI's contractual obligations below. We expect to renew each of these contracts under renewal provisions as provided in each contract. SJG recovers all prudently incurred fees through rates via the BGSS clause.\nIn addition, in the normal course of business, SJG and SJRG have entered into long-term contracts for natural gas supplies. SJRG has committed to purchase 721,900 dts/d of natural gas, from various suppliers, for terms ranging from five to eleven years at index-based prices. SJG has committed to a purchase of a minimum of 15,000 dts/d and up to 70,000 dts/d, from a supplier for a term of ten years at index-based prices. Also, in 2019 SJG entered into a two-year purchase agreement with a producer delivering 5,000 dts/day at SJG's Leidy Line for certified responsible gas from November 1, 2019 through October 31, 2021. The obligations for these purchases have not been included in the contractual obligations table below because the actual volumes and prices are not fixed.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations, in addition to those related to our usage of short-term borrowings under our credit facilities discussed above, and their applicable payment due dates as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Up to </td> <td>Years </td> <td>Years </td> <td>More than </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Cash Obligations </td> <td>Total </td> <td>1 Year </td> <td>2 & 3 </td> <td>4 & 5 </td> <td>5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal Payments on Long-Term Debt </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,950,946 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>142,801 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106,168 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131,168 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,570,809 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Long-Term Debt </td> <td>2,300,681 </td> <td> </td> <td>118,181 </td> <td> </td> <td>219,719 </td> <td> </td> <td>211,122 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,751,659 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction Obligations </td> <td>390,147 </td> <td> </td> <td>390,147 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Leases </td> <td>2,036 </td> <td> </td> <td>653 </td> <td> </td> <td>772 </td> <td> </td> <td>431 </td> <td> </td> <td>180 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance Leases </td> <td>7,137 </td> <td> </td> <td>145 </td> <td> </td> <td>290 </td> <td> </td> <td>290 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,412 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commodity Supply Purchase Obligations </td> <td>1,704,417 </td> <td> </td> <td>649,492 </td> <td> </td> <td>449,883 </td> <td> </td> <td>184,798 </td> <td> </td> <td>420,244 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental Remediation Costs </td> <td>193,575 </td> <td> </td> <td>45,265 </td> <td> </td> <td>98,743 </td> <td> </td> <td>20,969 </td> <td> </td> <td>28,598 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New Jersey Clean Energy Program </td> <td>26,321 </td> <td> </td> <td>26,321 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Purchase Obligations </td> <td>5,786 </td> <td> </td> <td>5,786 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Contractual Cash Obligations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,581,046 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,378,791 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>875,575 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>548,778 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,777,902 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-Term Debt in the table above does not include unamortized debt issuance costs of $29.6 million and unamortized debt discounts of $5.2 million, which are recorded as an offset to Long-Term Debt on the consolidated balance sheets.\nInterest on long-term debt in the table above includes the related interest obligations through maturity on all outstanding long-term debt. Expected asset retirement obligations and the liability for unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the table above as the total obligation cannot be calculated due to the subjective nature of these costs and timing of anticipated payments. SJI did not make contributions to its employee pension plans in 2020. Future pension contributions cannot be determined at this time. SJG's regulatory obligation to contribute $3.7 million annually to its postretirement benefit plans' trusts, as discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, is also not included as its duration is indefinite.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS - An off-balance sheet arrangement is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which SJI has either made guarantees or has certain other interests or obligations.\nSee \"Guarantees\" in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail.\nNOTES RECEIVABLE-AFFILIATES - See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\nLITIGATION - SJI and SJG are subject to claims, actions and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Neither SJI nor SJG can make any assurance as to the outcome of any of these actions but, based on an analysis of these claims and consultation with outside counsel, we do not believe that any of these claims, other than those described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the business or financial statements of SJI or SJG. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail on these claims.\nSOUTH JERSEY GAS COMPANY\nThis section of Management's Discussion focuses on SJG for the reported periods. In many cases, explanations and disclosures for both SJI and SJG are substantially the same or specific disclosures for SJG are included in the Management's Discussion for SJI.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS:\nFor information on the changes in SJG's results of operations from 2019 compared to 2018, refer to the Management Discussion & Analysis section in Item 7 of SJI's and SJG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe results of operations for the SJG utility operations are described above; therefore, this section primarily focuses on statistical information and other information that is not discussed in the results of operations under South Jersey Industries, Inc.

Annual degree-days is the sum of the daily totals.\nThroughput - Gas Utility Operations 2020 vs. 2019 - Total gas throughput decreased 23.6 MMdts, or 15%, in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to decreases in capacity release, which was due to warmer than normal weather that impacted the winter season and created less demand in SJG service territory. In addition, the decrease is the result of specific segmented releases on the Transco pipeline which were lower in 2020 compared to 2019.\nOperating Revenues & Utility Margin - See SJI's Management Discussion section above.\nOperations Expense - See SJI's Management Discussion section above.\nMaintenance Expense - See SJI's Management Discussion section above.\nDepreciation Expense - Depreciation expense increased $5.1 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to continuing investment in utility plant. The increased spending in recent years is a direct result of New Jersey's infrastructure improvement efforts, which included the approval of SJG's AIRP and SHARP, in addition to significant investment in new technology systems.\nEnergy and Other Taxes - The change in Energy and Other Taxes in 2020 compared with 2019 was not significant.\nOther Income and Expense - Other Income and Expense increased $1.2 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to higher AFUDC income.\nInterest Charges - Interest charges increased $1.7 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to higher amounts of long-term debt outstanding (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements).\nIncome Taxes - Income tax expense generally fluctuates as income before taxes changes. Minor variations will occur period to period as a result of effective tax rate adjustments.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES:\nFor information on the changes in SJG's liquidity and capital resources from 2019 compared to 2018, refer to the Management Discussion & Analysis section in Item 7 of SJI's and SJG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity and capital resources for SJG are substantially covered in the Management's Discussion of SJI (except for the items and transactions that relate to SJI and its nonutility subsidiaries). Those explanations are incorporated by reference into this discussion.\nLiquidity needs for SJG are driven by factors that include natural gas commodity prices; the impact of weather on customer bills; lags in fully collecting gas costs from customers under the BGSS charge, settlement of legal matters, and environmental remediation expenditures through the RAC; the timing of construction and remediation expenditures and related permanent financings; mandated tax payment dates; both discretionary and required repayments of long-term debt; and the amounts and timing of dividend payments.\nCash flows for the year ended December 31 were the following (in thousands):\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>191,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>112,974 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Used in Investing Activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(280,557) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(263,071) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(240,703) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>134,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,372 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities - Liquidity needs are first met with net cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities varies from year-to-year primarily due to the impact of weather on customer demand and related gas purchases, customer usage factors related to conversion efforts and the price of the natural gas commodity, inventory utilization, and gas cost recoveries. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2020 produced more net cash than 2019, primarily due to a cash payment related to a legal proceeding of a pricing dispute which was paid during the third quarter of 2019 (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements) and did not recur in 2020, along with customer growth and lower costs for environmental remediation.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities - SJG has a continuing need for cash resources for capital expenditures, primarily to invest in new and replacement facilities and equipment. SJG estimates the net cash outflows for capital expenditures for fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023 to be approximately $256.8 million, $240.2 million and $325.1 million, respectively. For capital expenditures, including those under the AIRP, SHARP and IIP, SJG expects to use short-term borrowings under both its commercial paper program and lines of credit from commercial banks to finance capital expenditures as incurred. From time to time, SJG may refinance the short-term debt incurred to support capital expenditures with long-term debt.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities - SJG supplements its operating cash flow and credit lines with both debt and equity capital. Over the years, SJG has used long-term debt, primarily in the form of First Mortgage Bonds and MTNs, secured by the same pool of utility assets, to finance its long-term borrowing needs. These needs are primarily capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment.\nCash dividends were not declared or paid by SJG to SJI in 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nSJG received $109.5 million in equity contributions from SJI in 2020; there were no equity contributions to SJG in 2019 or 2018. Future equity contributions will occur on an as needed basis.\nFor information on other financing activities at SJG, see the SJI Management & Discussion Analysis above.\nCapital Structure - SJG's capital structure was as follows:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common Equity </td> <td>53.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>49.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt </td> <td>44.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>43.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-Term Debt </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:\nCosts for remediation projects, net of recoveries from ratepayers, for 2020, 2019 and 2018, amounted to net cash outflows of $27.2 million, $42.7 million and $53.7 million, respectively. See the Contractual Cash Obligations Table below for the total expected net cash outflows for remediation projects for future years. As discussed in Notes 10, 11 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, environmental remediation costs are subject to recovery from ratepayers.\nSJG has certain commitments for both pipeline capacity and gas supply for which SJG pays fees regardless of usage. Those commitments, as of December 31, 2020, averaged $80.5 million annually and totaled $387.1 million over the contracts' lives. Approximately 35% of the financial commitments under these contracts expire during the next five years. SJG expects to renew each of these contracts under renewal provisions as provided in each contract. SJG recovers all such prudently incurred fees through rates via the BGSS.\nSee SJI's Contractual Obligations discussion related to SJG's long-term contracts for natural gas supplies which are not included in the table below.\nThe following table summarizes SJG's contractual cash obligations and their applicable payment due dates as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Cash Obligations </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Up to\n1 Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Years\n2 & 3\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Years\n4 & 5\n</td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal Payments on Long-Term Debt </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,078,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,809 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>873,301 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Long-Term Debt </td> <td>662,399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,076 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>475,004 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commodity Supply Purchase Obligations </td> <td>421,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>139,303 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental Remediation Costs </td> <td>101,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,557 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,744 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction Obligations </td> <td>352,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>352,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Leases </td> <td>762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New Jersey Clean Energy Program </td> <td>13,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Purchase Obligations </td> <td>5,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Contractual Cash Obligations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,635,463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>595,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>325,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>213,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,501,442 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-Term Debt in the table above does not include unamortized debt issuance costs of $9.4 million, which are recorded as an offset to Long-Term Debt on the balance sheets.\nInterest on long-term debt in the table above includes the related interest obligations through maturity on all outstanding long-term debt.\nExpected asset retirement obligations and the liability for unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the table above as the total obligation cannot be calculated due to the subjective nature of these costs and timing of anticipated payments.\nSJG did not make a pension plan contribution in 2020. Future pension contributions cannot be determined at this time. SJG's regulatory obligation to contribute $3.7 million annually to its postretirement benefit plans' trusts, as discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, is also not included as its duration is indefinite.\nLitigation - See SJG's disclosure in the Commitments and Contingencies section of SJI's Management Discussion above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements - SJG has no off-balance sheet arrangements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations\nIntroduction\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Management's Discussion) analyzes the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of SJI and its subsidiaries. It also includes management's analysis of past financial results and potential factors that may affect future results, potential future risks and approaches that may be used to manage them. Except where the content clearly indicates otherwise, SJI,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d or our\u201d refers to the holding company or the consolidated entity of SJI and all of its subsidiaries.\nManagement's Discussion is divided into the following two major sections:\n\u2022SJI - This section describes the financial condition and results of operations of SJI and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. It includes discussions of our regulated operations, including SJG, and our non-regulated operations.\n\u2022SJG - This section describes the financial condition and results of operations of SJG, a subsidiary of SJI and separate registrant, which comprises the SJG utility operations segment.\nBoth sections of Management's Discussion - SJI and SJG - are designed to provide an understanding of each company's respective operations and financial performance and should be read in conjunction with each other as well as in conjunction with the respective company's financial statements and the combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUnless otherwise noted, earnings per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis, and are based on weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding.\nOVERVIEW - SJI (or the Company) is an energy services holding company that provides a variety of products and services through the following direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries:\nSJIU\nSJIU was established as a subsidiary of SJI for the purpose of serving as a holding company that owns SJG, ETG and, until its sale, ELK.\nSJG\nSJG, a New Jersey corporation, is an operating public utility company engaged in the purchase, transmission and sale of natural gas for residential, commercial and industrial use. SJG also sells natural gas and pipeline transportation capacity (off-system sales) on a wholesale basis to various customers on the interstate pipeline system and transports natural gas purchased directly from producers or suppliers to their customers. SJG contributed approximately $108.1 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis in 2020.\nSJG's service territory covers approximately 2,500 square miles in the southern part of New Jersey. It includes 113 municipalities throughout Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland and Salem Counties and portions of Burlington, Camden and Gloucester Counties. SJG benefits from its proximity to Philadelphia, PA and Wilmington, DE on the western side of its service territory and the popular shore communities on the eastern side. Continuing expansion of SJG's infrastructure throughout its seven-county region has fueled annual customer growth and creates opportunities for future extension into areas not yet served by natural gas.\nSouthern New Jersey's oceanfront communities continue to experience demand for new single and multifamily homes for both seasonal and year-round living. Demand for existing homes has increased throughout our service territory, in line with national trends. Building expansions in the medical, education, warehouse/distribution, and retail sectors contributed to SJG's growth. At present, SJG serves approximately 80% of households within its territory with natural gas. SJG also serves southern New Jersey's diversified industrial base that includes processors of petroleum and agricultural products; chemical, glass and consumer goods manufacturers; and high technology industrial parks.\nAs of December 31, 2020, SJG served 404,886 residential, commercial and industrial customers in southern New Jersey, compared with 397,090 customers at December 31, 2019. No material part of SJG's business is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers. Gas sales, transportation and capacity release for 2020 amounted to 139.3 MMdts, of which 50.5 MMdts were firm sales and transportation, 1.0 MMdts were interruptible sales and transportation and 87.8 MMdts were off-system sales and capacity release. The breakdown of firm sales and transportation includes 48.1% residential, 22.9% commercial, 19.8% industrial, and 9.2% cogeneration and electric generation. As of December 31, 2020, SJG served 378,103 residential customers, 26,369 commercial customers and 414 industrial customers. This includes 2020 net additions\nof 7,410 residential customers and 386 commercial and industrial customers.\nSJG makes wholesale gas sales to gas marketers for resale and ultimate delivery to end users. These off-system\u201d sales are made possible through the issuance of the FERC Orders No. 547 and 636. Order No. 547 issued a blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing all parties, which are not interstate pipelines, to make FERC jurisdictional gas sales for resale at negotiated rates, while Order No. 636 allowed SJG to deliver gas at delivery points on the interstate pipeline system other than its own city gate stations and release excess pipeline capacity to third parties. During 2020, off-system sales amounted to 14.8 MMdts and capacity release amounted to 73.0 MMdts.\nSupplies of natural gas available to SJG that are in excess of the quantity required by those customers who use gas as their sole source of fuel (firm customers) make possible the sale and transportation of gas on an interruptible basis to commercial and industrial customers whose equipment is capable of using natural gas or other fuels, such as fuel oil and propane. The term interruptible\u201d is used in the sense that deliveries of natural gas may be terminated by SJG at any time if this action is necessary to meet the needs of higher priority customers as described in SJG's tariffs. In 2020, usage by interruptible customers, excluding off-system customers, amounted to 1.0 MMdts, or approximately 1% of the total throughput.\nETG\nOn July 1, 2018, SJI, through its wholly-owned subsidiary SJIU, acquired the assets of ETG and ELK from Pivotal Utility Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of Southern Company Gas. ELK was subsequently sold to a third party on July 31, 2020.\nETG is a regulated natural gas utility which distributes natural gas in seven counties in northern and central New Jersey. ETG serves residential, business and industrial customers, with a service territory that covers the northern part of New Jersey, including municipalities throughout Union, Middlesex, Sussex, Warren, Hunterdon, Morris and Mercer Counties. ETG was founded in 1855 and is based in Union, New Jersey. ETG contributed net income of approximately $47.7 million during 2020.\nETG believes growth exists in the expansion of its Northwestern service territory, the Franklin/Sparta area, and the Hackettstown Interconnect. ETG also serves northern New Jersey's diversified industrial base within its territory with natural gas, which includes pharmaceutical, food and beverage, and transportation industries.\nAs of December 31, 2020, ETG served 301,613 customers in northern and central New Jersey, including 277,852 residential customers, 23,663 commercial customers and 98 industrial customers. As of December 31, 2019, ETG served 297,191 customers. No material part of ETG's business is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers. Gas sales and transportation for 2020 amounted to 47.4 MMdts, of which 41.1 MMdts were firm sales and transportation and 6.3 MMdts were interruptible sales and transportation. The breakdown of firm sales and transportation includes 22.4 MMdts residential, 13.2 MMdts commercial, and 5.5 MMdts industrial.\nSJES\nSJI established SJES as a direct subsidiary for the purpose of serving as a holding company for all of SJI's non-utility businesses. The following businesses are wholly-owned subsidiaries of SJES:\nSJE\nSJE provides services for the acquisition and transportation of electricity for retail end users and markets total energy management services. SJE markets electricity to residential, commercial and industrial customers. Most customers served by SJE are located within New Jersey, northwestern Pennsylvania and New England. In 2020, SJE had a net loss of approximately $1.3 million which reduced SJI's net income on a consolidated basis by such amount.\nSJRG\nSJRG markets natural gas storage, commodity and transportation assets along with fuel management services on a wholesale basis. Customers include energy marketers, electric and gas utilities, power plants and natural gas producers. SJRG's marketing activities occur mainly in the mid-Atlantic, Appalachian and southern regions of the country.\nSJRG also conducts price risk management activities by entering into a variety of physical and financial transactions including forward contracts, swap agreements, option contracts and futures contracts. In 2020, SJRG contributed approximately $25.3 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.\nSJEX\nSJEX owns oil, gas and mineral rights in the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania. SJEX is considered part of SJI's wholesale energy operations. In 2020, SJEX contributed approximately $0.4 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.\nMarina\nMarina develops and operates on-site energy-related projects. There are several businesses under Marina, as discussed below.\nACLE, BCLE, SCLE and SXLE are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Marina, which own and operate landfill gas-to-energy production facilities in Atlantic, Burlington, Salem and Sussex Counties, respectively, located in New Jersey. On June 1, 2020, the BCLE, SCLE, and SXLE landfill gas-to-energy production facilities ceased operations after receiving approval from their respective local governmental authorities to do so.\nMarina owns four LLCs which own and operate rooftop solar generation sites located in New Jersey. All four were acquired in 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nIn 2020, SJI, through Marina, formed the Catamaran joint venture with a third party partner. Catamaran owns 100% of Annadale, of which Marina has a 93% ownership interest. Catamaran was formed for the purpose of developing, owning and operating renewable energy projects, and will support SJI's commitment to clean energy initiatives. Annadale has constructed two fuel cell projects totaling 7.5 MW in Staten Island, New York which began operations in December 2020 (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements).\nAlso in, 2020, the Company sold MTF and ACB for a final sales price of $97.0 million. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. MTF previously provided cooling, heating and emergency power to the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa in Atlantic City, NJ. ACB previously owned and operated a natural gas fueled combined heating, cooling and power facility located in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\nOn June 27, 2018, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Marina, entered into a series of agreements whereby Marina agreed to sell its portfolio of solar energy assets (for this section, the Transaction\u201d) to a third-party buyer. As part of the Transaction, Marina agreed to sell its distributed solar energy projects across New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts and Vermont (for this section, the Projects\u201d), along with the assets comprising the Projects. These sales occurred between 2018-2020. Also in connection with the Transaction, Marina is leasing back from the buyer certain of the Projects that have not yet passed the fifth anniversary of their placed-in-service dates for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The leaseback runs from the date each such project was acquired by the buyer until the later of the first anniversary of the applicable acquisition date and the fifth anniversary of the applicable placed-in-service date of the project. As of December 31, 2020, there are ten projects being leased back from the buyer through the end of 2021, which is the fifth anniversary of their placed-in-service date. The results of these projects being leased back are not material.\nThe Company currently has two projects that are not part of the Transaction and remain owned by Marina. These assets are recorded as held and used in Property, Plant and Equipment on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nIn 2020, Marina contributed approximately $14.9 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.\nSJESP\nSJESP receives commissions on appliance service contracts from a third party. In 2020, SJESP contributed approximately $1.7 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.\nSJEI\nSJEI provides energy procurement and cost reduction services. SJEI includes the following wholly-owned subsidiaries:\nAEP, an aggregator, broker and consultant in the retail energy markets, which was acquired in August 2019.\nEnerConnex, a retail and wholesale broker and consultant that matches end users with suppliers for the procurement of natural gas and electricity, which became 100% owned in 2020 (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements).\nIn 2020, SJEI contributed approximately $0.4 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.\nMidstream\nMidstream owns a 20% equity investment, along with four other investors, in PennEast. In 2020, Midstream contributed approximately $4.2 million to SJI's net income on a consolidated basis.\nOther\nSJI Renewable Energy Ventures, LLC and SJI RNG Devco, LLC are newly formed subsidiaries which hold the equity interest in REV LNG and the renewable natural gas development rights in certain dairy farms, respectively (see Notes 1, 3 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements).\nEMI principally manages liabilities associated with its discontinued operations of nonutility subsidiaries.\nPrimary Factors Affecting SJI's Business\nSJI's current long-term goals are to grow Economic Earnings Per Share 6-8% annually driven by high quality earnings, a strong balance sheet and a low-to-moderate risk profile. Management established those goals in conjunction with SJI's Board of Directors based upon a number of different internal and external factors that characterize and influence SJI's current and expected future activities.\nThe following is a summary of the primary factors we expect to have the greatest impact on SJI's performance and ability to achieve the long-term goals going forward:\nBusiness Model - In developing SJI's current business model, our focus has been on our core Utilities and natural extensions of those businesses, as well as strategic opportunities in our nonutility business that align with the goals of the EMP. That focus enables us to concentrate on business activities that match our core competencies. Going forward we expect to pursue business opportunities that fit and complement this model.\nCustomer Growth - SJG's area of operations is southern New Jersey. Residential new construction activity remains steady, supported by growth in higher density and multi-family units. Customers for SJG grew 2.0% for 2020 as SJG continues its focus on customer conversions. In 2020, the 4,326 consumers converting their homes and businesses from other heating fuels, such as electric, propane or oil, represented approximately 55% of the total new customer acquisitions for the year. Customers in SJG's service territory typically base their decisions to convert on comparisons of fuel costs, environmental considerations and efficiencies. While oil and propane prices have become more competitive with natural gas in the past two years, affecting the number of conversions, SJG began a comprehensive partnership with the State's Office of Clean Energy to educate consumers on energy efficiency and to promote the rebates and incentives available to natural gas users.\nETG's primary area of operations is central and northern NJ, which continues to grow in multifamily housing and gas infrastructure extensions to unserved areas. While ETG continues to partner with builders in the new construction sector with the view of increasing natural gas burner tips, ETG is pursuing conversions throughout its service territory. As a result, customer additions for ETG grew approximately 1.5%. In 2020, consumers converting their homes and businesses from other heating fuels, such as electric, propane or oil, represented approximately 42% of the total new customer acquisitions for the year. Customers in ETG service territories typically base their decisions to convert on fuel cost savings, efficiencies, and fuel stability pricing. ETG leverages its comprehensive partnership with the State's Office of Clean Energy to educate consumers on energy efficiency and to promote the rebates and incentives available to natural gas users.\nRegulatory Environment - SJG and ETG are primarily regulated by the BPU. The BPU approves the rates that are charged to rate-regulated customers for services provided and the terms of service under which the Utilities operate. The rates and established terms of service are designed to enable the Utilities to recover costs of service and obtain a fair and reasonable return on capital invested.\nSJG's BPU approved CIP, along with ETG's BPU approved WNC, protect the Utilities' net income from severe fluctuations in gas used by residential, commercial and small industrial customers.\nSJG's AIRP is a program to replace cast iron and unprotected bare steel mains and services. All AIRP investments are reflected in base rates. Additionally, the BPU issued an Order approving an extension of the AIRP for a five-year period ( AIRP II\u201d), commencing October 1, 2016, with authorized investments of up to $302.5 million to continue replacing cast iron and unprotected bare steel mains and associated services. SJG earns a return on AIRP II investments once they are placed in service and, thereafter, once they are included in rate base, through annual filings. SJG's SHARP is a program to replace low-pressure distribution mains and services with high-pressure mains and services in coastal areas that are susceptible to flooding during major storms. In May 2018, the BPU issued an order approving a second phase of the SHARP (\"SHARP II\") for a three-year period, commencing June 1, 2018, with authorized investments of up to $100.3 million to continue storm hardening efforts to further improve safety, redundancy and resiliency of SJG's natural gas system in coastal areas. Pursuant to the order, SHARP II investments are to be recovered through annual base rate adjustments.\nIn September 2020, the BPU approved the settlement of SJG's rate case petition, resulting in an increase in annual revenues from base rates effective October 1, 2020 of $39.5 million.\nIn September 2020, the BPU approved, on a provisional basis, a $59.4 million decrease in gas cost recoveries, effective October 1, 2020. SJG's BGSS filing included consideration of $22.9 million of costs requested to be recovered over a two-year period related to a previous dispute on a long-term gas supply contract that was settled during 2019. The provisional rate adjustments effective October 1, 2020 include the temporary removal of these amounts to allow for a further review of these costs during the course of this proceeding which we expect to be completed during the second quarter of 2021.\nConsistent with ETG/ELK Acquisition approval, SJI was required to develop a plan, in concert with the BPU and the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel, to address the replacement of ETG's aging infrastructure. In June 2019, the BPU approved a $300.0 million IIP effective July 1, 2019. The Order authorized the recovery of costs associated with ETG's investments of approximately $300.0 million between 2019-2024 to replace its cast-iron and bare steel vintage main and related services. The Order provides for annual recovery of ETG's investments through a separate rate mechanism.\nIn November 2019, the BPU approved the settlement of ETG's rate case petition, resulting in an increase to base rate revenues by $34.0 million with new rates in effect November 15, 2019.\nOn July 2, 2020, the BPU issued an Order authorizing New Jersey's regulated utilities to create a COVID-19-related regulatory asset by deferring on their books and records the prudently incurred incremental costs related to COVID-19 beginning on March 9, 2020 and continuing through September 30, 2021, or 60 days after the termination of the public health emergency, whichever is later. See \"COVID-19\" section below.\nFor more information on the regulatory environments of the Utilities, see Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\nWeather Conditions and Customer Usage Patterns - Usage patterns can be affected by a number of factors, such as wind, precipitation, temperature extremes and customer conservation. SJG's earnings are largely protected from fluctuations in temperatures by the CIP. The CIP has a stabilizing effect on utility earnings as SJG adjusts revenues when actual usage per customer experienced during an annual period varies from an established baseline usage per customer. The WNC rate allows ETG to implement surcharges or credits during the months of October through May to compensate for weather-related changes in customer usage from the previous winter period. The impact of different weather conditions on the earnings of our nonutility businesses is dependent on a range of different factors. Consequently, weather may impact the earnings of SJI's various subsidiaries in different, or even opposite, ways. Further, the profitability of individual subsidiaries may vary from year-to-year despite experiencing substantially similar weather conditions.\nChanges in Natural Gas and Electricity Prices - The Utilities' gas costs are passed on directly to customers without any profit margin added. The price the Utilities charge their periodic customers is set annually, with a regulatory mechanism in place to make limited adjustments to that price during the course of a year. In the event that gas cost increases would justify customer price increases greater than those permitted under the regulatory mechanism, the Utilities can petition the BPU for an incremental rate increase. High prices can make it more difficult for customers to pay their bills and may result in elevated levels of bad debt expense. Among our nonutility activities, the business most likely to be impacted by changes in natural gas prices is our wholesale gas marketing business. Wholesale gas marketing typically benefits from volatility in gas prices during different points in time. The actual price of the commodity does not typically have an impact on the performance of this business line. Our ability to add and retain customers at our retail electric business is affected by the relationship between the price that the utility charges customers for electricity and the cost available in the market at specific points in time. However, retail electric accounts form a very small portion of SJI's overall activities.\nFuel Supply Management - SJRG has acquired pipeline transportation capacity that allows SJRG to match end users, many of which are merchant generators, with producers looking to find a long-term solution for their supply. We currently have nine fuel supply management contracts and expect to continue expanding this business.\nPennEast - Midstream has a 20% investment in PennEast. The PennEast project has been delayed since September 2019 as a result of various court decisions and ongoing appeals. As a result, the Company evaluated its investment in PennEast for other-than-temporary impairment, and at this time, we believe we do not have an other-than-temporary impairment and have not recorded any impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our investment. PennEast management remains committed to pursuing the project and intends to pursue all available options. SJI, along with the other partners, are intending to continue to contribute to the project. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more information, including a timeline of recent events.\nChanges in Interest Rates - SJI has operated in a relatively low interest rate environment over the past several years. Rising interest rates would raise the expense associated with existing variable-rate debt and all issuances of new debt. We have sought to mitigate the impact of a potential rising rate environment by issuing fixed-rate debt. SJG also has derivative transactions to hedge against rising interest rates on its variable-rate debt.\nBalance Sheet Strength - SJI's and SJG's goal is to maintain a strong balance sheet. SJI's average equity-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 33% and 32% as calculated for the four quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. SJG's average equity-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 53% and 51% as calculated for the four quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. A strong balance sheet assists us in maintaining the financial flexibility necessary to take advantage of growth opportunities and to address volatile economic and commodity markets while maintaining a low-to-moderate risk platform.\nLabor and Benefit Costs - Labor and benefit costs have a significant impact on SJI's profitability. Benefit costs, especially those related to pension and health care, have risen in recent years. We seek to manage these costs by revising health care plans offered to existing employees, capping postretirement health care benefits, and changing health care and pension packages offered to new hires. In addition, in 2018, the Company offered an ERIP to non-union, non-Officer employees over the age of 55 years old with 20 or more years of service to the Company as well as to Officers over the age of 55 years old with 5 or more years of service to the Company. In 2020, SJG entered into a VSIP program with IBEW Local 1293 and IAM Local 76 union employees over the age of 60 years old with 10 or more years of service to SJG (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements).\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES - ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS - As described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain types of transactions presented in our consolidated financial statements require a significant amount of judgment and estimation. These relate to regulatory accounting, derivatives, environmental remediation costs, pension and other postretirement benefit costs, revenue recognition, goodwill, evaluation of equity method investments for other-than-temporary impairment, and income taxes.\nRegulatory Accounting (see Notes 10 & 11 to the consolidated financial statements) - The Utilities maintain their accounts according to the Uniform System of Accounts as prescribed by the BPU. As a result of the ratemaking process, the Utilities are required to follow ASC 980, Regulated Operations, which requires them to recognize the impact of regulatory decisions on their financial statements. The Utilities are required under their BGSS clauses to forecast their natural gas costs and customer consumption in setting their rates. Subject to regulator approval, they are able to recover or return the difference between gas cost recoveries and the actual costs of gas through a BGSS charge to customers. The Utilities record any over/under recoveries as a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets and reflect them in the BGSS charge to customers in subsequent years. The Utilities also enter into derivatives that are used to hedge natural gas purchases. The offset to the resulting derivative assets or liabilities is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDerivatives (see Notes 16 & 17 to the consolidated financial statements) - SJI recognizes assets or liabilities for contracts that qualify as derivatives that are entered into by its subsidiaries when such contracts are executed. We record contracts at their fair value in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. We record changes in the fair value of the effective portion of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges, net of tax, in AOCL and recognize such changes in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded in earnings in the current period. Currently we do not have any energy-related derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting has been discontinued for the remaining interest rate derivatives. As a result, unrealized gains and losses on these derivatives, that were previously recorded in AOCL on the consolidated balance sheets, are being recorded into earnings over the remaining life of the derivative.\nCounterparty credit risk and the credit risk of SJI, are incorporated and considered in the valuation of all derivative instruments, as appropriate. The effect of counterparty credit risk and the credit risk of SJI on the derivative valuations is not significant.\nCertain derivatives that result in the physical delivery of the commodity may meet the criteria to be accounted for as normal purchases and normal sales, if so designated, in which case the contract is not marked-to-market, but rather is accounted for when the commodity is delivered. Due to the application of regulatory GAAP, derivatives related to the Utilities' gas purchases that are marked-to-market are recorded through the BGSS. The Utilities periodically enter into financial derivatives to hedge against forward price risk. These derivatives are recorded at fair value with an offset to regulatory assets and liabilities through the BGSS, subject to BPU approval (see Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements). We adjust the fair value of the contracts each reporting period for changes in the market.\nAs discussed in Notes 16 and 17 of the consolidated financial statements, energy-related derivative instruments are traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. Exchange-based contracts are valued using unadjusted quoted market sources in active markets and are categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. Certain non-exchange-based contracts are valued using indicative price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges and are categorized in Level 2. These price quotations reflect the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices and are obtained from sources that management believes provide the most liquid market. Management reviews and corroborates the price quotations with at least one additional source to ensure the prices are observable market information, which includes consideration of actual transaction volumes, market delivery points, bid-ask spreads and contract duration. Derivative instruments that are used to limit our exposure to changes in interest rates on variable-rate, long-term debt are valued using quoted prices on commonly quoted intervals, which are interpolated for periods different than the quoted intervals, as inputs to a market valuation model. Market inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment, as a result, these instruments are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. For non-exchange-based derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs. In instances where observable data is unavailable, management considers the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility and contract duration. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the model inputs generally are not observable.\nManagement uses the discounted cash flow model to value Level 3 physical and financial forward contracts, which calculates mark-to-market valuations based on forward market prices, original transaction prices, volumes, risk-free rate of return and credit spreads. Inputs to the valuation model are reviewed and revised as needed, based on historical information, updated market data, market liquidity and relationships, and changes in third party pricing sources. The validity of the mark-to-market valuations and changes in these values from period to period are examined and qualified against historical expectations by the risk management function. If any discrepancies are identified during this process, the mark-to-market valuations or the market pricing information is evaluated further and adjusted, if necessary.\nLevel 3 valuation methods for natural gas derivative contracts include utilizing another location in close proximity adjusted for certain pipeline charges to derive a basis value. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of certain natural gas contracts consist of forward prices developed based on industry-standard methodologies. Significant increases (decreases) in these forward prices for purchases of natural gas would result in a directionally similar impact to the fair value measurement and for sales of natural gas would result in a directionally opposite impact to the fair value measurement. Level 3 valuation methods for electricity represent the value of the contract marked to the forward wholesale curve, as provided by daily exchange quotes for delivered electricity. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of electric contracts consist of fixed contracted electric load profiles; therefore, no change in unobservable inputs would occur. Unobservable inputs are updated daily using industry-standard techniques. Management reviews and corroborates the price quotations to ensure the prices are observable which includes consideration of actual transaction volumes, market delivery points, bid-ask spreads and contract duration.\nEnvironmental Remediation Costs (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements) - We estimate a range of future costs based on projected investigation and work plans using existing technologies. In preparing consolidated financial statements, SJI records liabilities for future costs using the lower end of the range because a single reliable estimation point is not feasible due to the amount of uncertainty involved in the nature of projected remediation efforts and the long period over which remediation efforts will continue. We update estimates each year to take into account past efforts, changes in work plans, remediation technologies, government regulations and site specific requirements.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Costs (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements) - The costs of providing pension and other postretirement employee benefits are impacted by actual plan experience as well as assumptions of future experience. Employee demographics, plan contributions, investment performance, and assumptions concerning mortality, return on plan assets, discount rates and health care cost trends all have a significant impact on determining our projected benefit obligations. We evaluate these assumptions annually and adjust them accordingly. These adjustments could result in significant changes to the net periodic benefit costs of providing such benefits and the related liabilities recognized by SJI.\nRevenue Recognition (see Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements) - Gas and electricity revenues are recognized in the period the commodity is delivered to customers. All SJI entities bill customers monthly. A majority of customers have their meters read on a cycle basis throughout the month. For retail customers (including SJG) that are not billed at the end of the month, we record an estimate to recognize unbilled revenues for gas/electricity delivered from the date of the last meter reading to the end of the month.\nUtility Revenue\nWe bill SJG and ETG customers at rates approved by the BPU.\nThe BPU allows the Utilities to recover gas costs in rates through the BGSS price structure. The Utilities defer over/under recoveries of gas costs and includes them in subsequent adjustments to the BGSS rate. These adjustments result in over/under recoveries of gas costs being included in rates during future periods. As a result of these deferrals, utility revenue recognition does not directly translate to profitability. While the Utilities realize profits on gas sales during the month of providing the utility service, significant shifts in revenue recognition may result from the various recovery clauses approved by the BPU. This revenue recognition process does not shift earnings between periods, as these clauses only provide for cost recovery on a dollar-for-dollar basis (see Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements).\nThe Utilities' unbilled revenue for natural gas is estimated each month based on monthly deliveries into the system; unaccounted for natural gas based on historical results; customer-specific use factors, when available; actual temperatures during the period; and applicable customer rates.\nThe Utilities also have revenues that arise from alternative revenue programs, which are discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.\nFor the Utilities, unrealized gains and losses on energy-related derivative instruments are recorded in Regulatory Assets or Regulatory Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets of SJI and SJG until they become realized, in which case they are recognized in operating revenues.\nNonutility Revenue\nSJE and SJRG customers are billed at rates negotiated between the parties.\nSJRG's gas revenues are recognized in the period the commodity is delivered. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on energy-related derivative instruments are also recognized in operating revenues for SJRG. SJRG presents revenues and expenses related to its energy trading activities on a net basis in Operating Revenues - Nonutility in the statements of consolidated income consistent with GAAP. This net presentation has no effect on operating income or net income.\nThe Company recognizes revenues on commissions received related to SJESP appliance service contracts, along with AEP and ECX energy procurement service contracts from a third party, on a monthly basis as the commissions are earned.\nMarina recognizes revenue for renewable energy projects when output is generated and delivered to the customer, and when renewable energy credits have been transferred to the third party at an agreed upon price.\nGoodwill (see Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements) - The segments that have goodwill are ETG Utility Operations and Corporate & Services. Goodwill represents future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration paid or transferred over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount.\nThe Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year beginning with a qualitative assessment at the reporting unit level. The reporting unit level is identified by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available, whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components and whether the economic and regulatory characteristics are similar. Factors utilized in the qualitative analysis performed on goodwill in our reporting units include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, company specific operating results and other relevant entity-specific events affecting individual reporting units.\nIf sufficient qualitative factors exist, potential goodwill impairment is evaluated quantitatively. Potential impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the book value, including goodwill. The Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis. Management also considers other methods, which includes a market multiples analysis. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, discount and growth rates, capital expenditures, tax rates, and projected terminal values.\nChanges in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. If the fair value exceeds book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the book value exceeds fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess up until the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2019, certain qualitative factors were present that required the Company to perform a quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment at March 31, 2020 related to the ETG reporting unit. The qualitative factors primarily included macroeconomic conditions related to COVID-19. During the third quarter of 2020, due to a decline in market conditions for gas distributors and our performance relative to the overall sector, the Company determined it necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment as of September 30, 2020 related to the ETG reporting unit. There were no impairments recorded as a result of either interim impairment test. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn preparing the goodwill impairment tests, the fair value of the reporting unit was calculated using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, capital expenditures, tax rates, projected terminal values and assumptions related to discount and growth rates, and implied market multiples for a selected group of peer companies. Based on the analysis performed, the fair value of the ETG reporting unit closely approached, but exceeded, its carrying amount. Should economic conditions deteriorate in future periods or remain depressed for a prolonged period of time, estimates of future cash flows and market valuation assumptions may not be sufficient to support the carrying value, requiring impairment charges in the future.\nEvaluation of Equity Method Investments for Other-Than-Temporary Impairment (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) - Our evaluation of impairment of equity method investments when conditions exist that could indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than book value includes key inputs that involve significant management judgments and estimates, including projections of the investment's cash flows, selection of a discount rate and probability weighting of potential outcomes of legal and regulatory proceedings and other available options.\nAs a result of the September 2019 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals and continuing events (see \"PennEast\" above), we evaluated our investment in the PennEast project for an other-than-temporary impairment. Our impairment assessment used a discounted cash flow income approach, including consideration of the severity and duration of any decline in fair value of our investment in the project. Our significant estimates and assumptions included development options and legal outcomes, construction costs, timing of in-service dates (which have been delayed from the initial timing assumed in our analysis as of December 31, 2019), revenues (including forecasted volumes and rates), and discount rates. At this time, we believe that we do not have an other-than-temporary impairment and have not recorded any impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our investment.\nOur evaluation also considered the current economic conditions as a result of COVID-19, noting that the timelines, potential options and legal proceedings have not been impacted. However, the legal and regulatory proceedings could have unfavorable outcomes, or there could be other future unfavorable developments, such as a reduced likelihood of success from development options and legal outcomes, estimated increases in construction costs, increases in the discount rate, or further significant delays, or PennEast could conclude that the project is not viable or does not go forward as actions progress. These could impact our conclusions with respect to other-than-temporary impairment and may require that we recognize an impairment charge of up to our recorded investment in the project, net of any cash and working capital.\nWe will continue to monitor and update this analysis as required. Different assumptions could affect the timing and amount of any charge recorded in a period.\nIncome Taxes - The determination of SJI's and SJG's provision for income taxes requires the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of tax laws. Judgment is required in assessing the deductibility and recoverability of certain tax benefits. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the Company's deferred tax assets will not be realized. Any significant changes to the estimates and judgments with respect to the interpretations, timing or deductibility could result in a material change to earnings and cash flows. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCOVID-19 - In March 2020, the World Health Organization classified the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic. The rapid spread has resulted in worldwide shutdowns and the halting of business and personal activity as governments around the world imposed regulations to control the spread of COVID-19. As a result, the global economy has been marked by significant slowdowns and uncertainty.\nOur business operations continue to function effectively during the pandemic. We are continuously evaluating the global pandemic and are taking necessary steps to mitigate known risks. We continue to closely monitor developments related to the pandemic and will adjust our actions and operations as appropriate in order to continue to provide safe and reliable service to our customers and communities while keeping employees safe. Although the impact to the operations of SJI and SJG has been minimal to date as discussed below, given the pandemic remains prevalent and the situation is evolving, the future impact on the business of SJI and SJG besides what is noted below is unknown. SJI and SJG provide critical and essential services to our customers and the health and safety of our employees and customers is our first priority. SJI and SJG considered the impact of COVID-19 on the use of estimates and assumptions used for financial reporting and noted there were no material impacts on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, as operations and delivery of product to our customers has not been materially impacted. To date, SJI has not experienced significant reductions in sales volumes across our businesses, and we do not anticipate any significant reductions in sales volumes going forward.\nSJI has been actively addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and has established a task force comprised of members of management, with the mission of ensuring the safety of individuals (customers and employees), while continuing to perform our daily responsibilities in an efficient and safe manner. SJI is following the guidance from federal, state and local authorities to help safeguard the health, safety and well-being of its employees. To date, all of our employees are currently working. The task force identified which roles are essential (i.e. need to work in field/office to conduct daily activities) and non-essential (i.e. able to perform work from a remote location) and developed a plan for all employees in non-essential roles to work remotely from home while ensuring that the appropriate safety measures are in place for all employees in essential roles in the field/office. These plans remain in place, as all employees in non-essential roles continue to work remotely. For employees in essential roles, safety measures include additional personal protective equipment and adjusting shifts to reduce the number of workers in close contact. Given the additional safety measures in place, and the ability for employees in non-essential roles to work remotely, we have not had a material impact on our operations as a result of these human capital constraints, and we do not believe operations will be materially impacted going forward by human capital constraints.\nIn order to initiate the business continuity plan, the Company has incurred operating costs for emergency supplies, cleaning services, enabling technology and other specific needs during the pandemic. SJI has incurred costs during 2020 of $2.2 million, with $0.6 million being recorded as Property, Plant & Equipment on the consolidated balance sheets, and the remaining $1.6 million recorded as Operations Expense on the consolidated statements of income. SJG has recorded $0.2 million of such costs, which are recorded as Property, Plant & Equipment on the balance sheets. Going forward, we expect further expenses for the above mentioned items; however, we do not anticipate these additional expenses to be material.\nThe supply chain has not been materially impacted by COVID-19; this is because the Company has a large inventory of standard products such as pipe material. In addition, given that the products are considered essential products, factories are remaining open, therefore allowing materials to be replenished. The Company is actively managing the materials, supplies and contract services necessary for our operations, and does not expect a disruption to the Company's gas supply in the future.\nOur infrastructure investment programs to replace and upgrade critical utility infrastructure continue to move forward. As a result of COVID-19, certain construction activity had been delayed due to some activity being ceased in accordance with directives from the Governor of New Jersey earlier in 2020. Construction activity has since resumed given the directive from the Governor was lifted. Our infrastructure investment programs continue to move forward; however, to the extent the pandemic worsens or a similar directive is put in place in the future for a long period of time, our capital projects could be significantly impacted.\nWe have considered the impact of COVID-19 on the liquidity position of the Company, and note that it has remained stable throughout this uncertain period, and that SJI's and SJG's ability to borrow has not been materially impacted to date. Further, SJI and SJG have successfully paid off and refinanced debt, and raised equity through the ATM offering, during 2020. In addition, SJI has continued to pay its quarterly dividend throughout 2020. See Liquidity and Capital resources section for a detailed description of borrowings entered into during the period.\nWe considered the impact the pandemic has had on operating revenues, noting that SJI and SJG have not seen a significant reduction in revenues as a result of the pandemic. This is due to gas and electricity being considered an essential service and continuing to be delivered timely to customers, and no delays or operational shutdowns taking place to date. Given the performance obligation is satisfied at delivery, which matches the time when the Company is able to invoice the customer, the Company is confident in being able to meet its future performance obligations. To the extent that the pandemic does impact our ability to deliver in the future, operating revenues could be impacted.\nAll accounts receivables are carried at the amount owed by customers. The provision for uncollectible accounts is established based on expected credit losses. On July 2, 2020, the BPU issued an Order authorizing New Jersey's regulated utilities to create a COVID-19-related regulatory asset by deferring on their books and records the prudently incurred incremental costs related to COVID-19 beginning on March 9, 2020 and continuing through September 30, 2021, or 60 days after the termination of the public health emergency, whichever is later. The Company will be required to file quarterly reports with the BPU, along with a petition for recovery of such incremental costs with the BPU by December 31, 2021 or within 60 days of the close of the tracking period, whichever is later. During the year ended December 31, 2020, ETG deferred $6.1 million and SJG deferred $4.8 million of incremental costs principally related to expected credit losses from uncollectibles as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically related to changes in payment patterns observed to date and consideration of macroeconomic factors. We have deemed these costs to be probable of recovery (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). The Utilities have suspended disconnects for nonpayment by our customers, based on orders and requests from our various regulators. These suspensions will go through at least March 15, 2021 based on an executive order issued by the Governor of New Jersey, in which water, gas and electricity providers are barred from cutting services to New Jersey residents.\nGiven the impact that COVID-19 has had on the economy, on March 27, 2020 the President signed into law the CARES Act, an economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, as a way to provide relief to both businesses and individuals affected by the virus. The CARES Act contains several corporate tax provisions that impacted SJI and SJG, including deferring payments on social security taxes for employees and other employee retention credits. These impacts of the CARES Act, and these provisions, did not have a material effect on income tax expense or deferred tax assets/liabilities.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting macroeconomic market conditions, the Company determined it necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis on the goodwill at the ETG reporting unit as of March 31, 2020, and again as of September 30, 2020. There were no impairments recorded as a result of either interim impairment test. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, along with \"Goodwill\" above.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - See discussions concerning New Accounting Pronouncements and their impact on SJI in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRATES AND REGULATION - The Utilities are subject to regulation by the BPU. Additionally, the Natural Gas Policy Act contains provisions for Federal regulation of certain aspects of the Utilities' business. The Utilities are affected by Federal regulation with respect to transportation and pricing policies applicable to pipeline capacity from Transco (both utilities' major supplier), Columbia and Dominion, since such services are provided under rates and terms established under the jurisdiction of the FERC. The Utilities' retail sales are made under rate schedules within a tariff filed with, and subject to the jurisdiction of, the BPU. These rate schedules provide primarily for either block rates or demand/commodity rate structures. The Utilities' primary rate mechanisms include base rates, the BGSS, Accelerated Infrastructure Programs, EET and the CIP for SJG, and BGSS and WNC for ETG.\nThe CIP is a BPU-approved program that is designed to eliminate the link between SJG profits and the quantity of natural gas SJG sells, and to foster conservation efforts. With the CIP, SJG's profits are tied to the number of customers served and how efficiently SJG serves them, thus allowing SJG to focus on encouraging conservation and energy efficiency among its customers without negatively impacting net income. The CIP tracking mechanism adjusts revenue based on weather, and also adjusts SJG's revenue when actual usage per customer experienced during an annual period varies from an established baseline usage per customer.\nEach CIP year begins October 1 and ends September 30 of the subsequent year. On a monthly basis during a CIP year, SJG records adjustments to revenue based on weather and customer usage factors, as incurred. Subsequent to each year, SJG makes filings with the BPU to review and approve amounts recorded under the CIP. BPU-approved cash inflows or outflows generally will not begin until the next CIP year and have no impact on revenue at that time.\nUtility revenue is recognized during current periods based upon the application of the CIP. The cash impact of variations in customer usage will result in cash being collected from, or returned to, customers during the subsequent CIP year, which runs from October 1 to September 30.\nThe effects of the CIP on SJG's net income for the last three years and the associated weather comparisons were as follows (in millions):\n\nAs part of the CIP, SJG is required to implement additional conservation programs, including customized customer communication and outreach efforts, targeted upgrade furnace efficiency packages, financing offers, and an outreach program to speak to local and state institutional constituents. SJG is also required to reduce gas supply and storage assets and their associated fees. Note that changes in fees associated with supply and storage assets have no effect on SJG's net income as these costs are passed through directly to customers on a dollar-for-dollar basis.\nEarnings accrued and payments received under the CIP are limited to a level that will not cause SJG's return on equity to exceed 9.6% (excluding earnings from off-system gas sales and certain other tariff clauses) and CIP recoveries are limited by the annualized savings attained from reducing gas supply and storage assets.\nFor ETG, the WNC is a BPU-approved program that is designed to recover or refund balances associated with differences between actual and normal weather during the preceding winter period(s). The effective winter period of the WNC is defined as October through May.\nIn 2020, ETG's net income was increased by $10.2 million, primarily due to warmer than average weather for the applicable months in the 2020 winter period. In 2019, ETG's net income was reduced by $5.9 million, primarily due to colder than average weather for the applicable months in the 2019 winter period.\nSee additional discussions on Rates and Regulatory Actions in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.\nENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION - See discussion concerning Environmental Remediation in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCOMPETITION - The Utilities' franchises are non-exclusive. Currently, no other utility provides retail gas distribution services within the Utilities territories, and we do not expect any other utilities to do so in the foreseeable future because of the extensive investment required for utility plant and related costs. The Utilities compete with oil, propane and electricity suppliers for residential, commercial and industrial users, with alternative fuel source providers (wind, solar and fuel cells) based upon price, convenience and environmental factors, and with other marketers/brokers in the selling of wholesale natural gas services. The market for natural gas commodity sales is subject to competition due to deregulation. SJG's competitive position was enhanced while maintaining margins by using an unbundled tariff. This tariff allows full cost-of-service recovery when transporting gas for SJG's customers. Under this tariff, SJG profits from transporting, rather than selling, the commodity. SJG's residential, commercial and industrial customers can choose their supplier, while SJG recovers the cost of service through transportation service (See Customer Choice Legislation below).\nSJRG competes in the wholesale natural gas market against a wide array of competitors on a cost competitive, term of service, and reliability basis. SJRG has been a reliable energy provider in this arena for more than 20 years.\nMarina competes with other companies that develop and operate similar types of on-site energy production. Marina also faces competition from customers' preferences for alternative technologies for energy production, as well as those customers that address their energy needs internally.\nCUSTOMER CHOICE LEGISLATION - All residential natural gas customers in New Jersey can choose their natural gas commodity supplier under the terms of the Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act of 1999.\" This bill created the framework and necessary time schedules for the restructuring of the state's electric and natural gas utilities. The Act established unbundling, where redesigned utility rate structures allow natural gas and electric consumers to choose their energy supplier. It also established time frames for instituting competitive services for customer account functions and for determining whether basic gas supply services should become competitive. Customers purchasing natural gas from a provider other than the local utility (the marketer\u201d) are charged for the gas costs by the marketer and charged for the transportation costs by the utility. The total number of customers in SJG's service territory purchasing natural gas from a marketer averaged 21,089, 22,216 and 25,665 during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The total number of customers in ETG's service territory purchasing natural gas from a marketer averaged 9,179 and 8,338 during 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS:\nFor information on the changes in results of operations from 2019 compared to 2018, refer to the Management Discussion & Analysis section in Item 7 of SJI's and SJG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSJI operates in several different reportable operating segments. These segments are as follows:\n\u2022SJG utility operations consist primarily of natural gas distribution to residential, commercial and industrial customers in southern New Jersey.\n\u2022ETG utility operations consist primarily of natural gas distribution to residential, commercial and industrial customers in northern and central New Jersey.\n\u2022ELK utility operations consist of natural gas distribution to residential, commercial and industrial customers in Maryland. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, on July 31, 2020, SJI sold ELK to a third-party buyer.\n\u2022Wholesale energy operations include the activities of SJRG and SJEX.\n\u2022Retail gas and other operations at SJE included natural gas acquisition and transportation service business lines. This business was sold on November 30, 2018 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022Retail electric operations at SJE consist of electricity acquisition and transportation to commercial, industrial and residential customers.\n\u2022On-site energy production consists of MTF and ACB, which were sold on February 18, 2020. This segment also includes other energy-related projects, including three legacy solar projects, one of which was sold during the first quarter of 2020. Also included in this segment are the activities of ACLE, BCLE, SCLE and SXLE. Operations at BCLE, SCLE, and SXLE ceased during the second quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, on-site energy production also includes newly acquired entities which own and operate solar-generation sites located in New Jersey, as well as the Catamaran joint venture, which owns Annadale (see Notes 1 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022Appliance service operations includes SJESP, which receives commissions on appliance service contracts from a third party.\n\u2022Midstream was formed to invest in infrastructure and other midstream projects, including an investment in PennEast.\n\u2022Corporate & Services segment includes costs related to acquisitions and divestitures, along with other unallocated costs. Also included in this segment are the results of SJEI and the assets related to our transactions with REV LNG (see Notes 3 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022Intersegment represents intercompany transactions among the above SJI consolidated entities.\nSJI groups its utility businesses under its wholly-owned subsidiary SJIU. This group consists of gas utility operations of SJG and ETG and, until its sale, ELK. SJI groups its nonutility operations into separate categories: Energy Group, Energy Services, Midstream and Corporate & Services. Energy Group includes wholesale energy, retail electric and, until its sale, retail gas and other operations. Energy Services includes on-site energy production and appliance service operations. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nSJI's net income for 2020 increased $80.1 million to $157.0 million compared to 2019. SJI's income from continuing operations for 2020 increased $80.1 million to $157.3 million compared to 2019. The significant drivers for the overall changes were as follows (all numbers in the bullet points below are presented after-tax):\n\u2022The income contribution from on-site energy production at Marina increased $24.0 million to $14.9 million, primarily due to ITC recorded on assets of recently acquired fuel cell and solar projects as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, along with the impact of impairment charges taken in 2019 that did not recur in 2020. These were partially offset with depreciation recorded on solar projects previously held for sale and the impact of less earnings from MTF/ACB due to its sale in February 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements)\n\u2022The income contribution from the wholesale energy operations at SJRG increased $23.9 million to $25.3 million, primarily due to higher margins on daily energy trading activities, along with a refund received from a third party supplier as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Also contributing to the increase was the change in unrealized gains and losses on forward financial contracts due to price volatility.\n\u2022The income contribution from gas utility operations at SJG increased $20.7 million to $108.1 million, primarily due to an increase in base rates as the BPU approved the settlement of SJG's rate case petition in September 2020 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), along with customer growth and the roll-in to rates of infrastructure program investments. SJG's utility margin also increased from its CIP mechanism as discussed in \"Utility Margin - SJG Utility Operations\" below. These were partially offset with increases in depreciation and maintenance expenses, along with a one-time tax adjustment resulting from SJG's Stipulation of Settlement with the BPU as part of its recent filing (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022The income contribution from the gas utility operations at ETG increased $13.5 million to $47.7 million, primarily due to positive margins due to favorable changes in base rates resulting from the completion of ETG's rate case in November 2019 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), along with customer growth and lower maintenance expenses. This was partially offset with higher operations and depreciation expenses.\n\u2022SJI incurred $2.5 million less severance and other employee separation costs during 2020 compared to 2019.\n\u2022Partially offsetting the above are items including:\n\u25e6Various tax items, most notably a state deferred tax valuation allowance (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u25e6A net increase in financing and interest costs at the SJI level (i.e. excluding SJG and ETG, as these are included in the income contributions noted above) during 2020 compared to 2019. These increases were primarily due to interest incurred on higher amounts of long-term debt outstanding, along with expenses incurred to terminate SJI's interest rate swaps (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). These increased costs were partially offset by changes in the mark-to-market valuations of SJI's interest rate swaps prior to termination in 2020.\nA significant portion of the volatility in operating results is due to the impact of the accounting methods associated with SJI's derivative activities. SJI uses derivatives to limit its exposure to market risk on transactions to buy, sell, transport and store natural gas and to buy and sell retail electricity. SJI also uses derivatives to limit its exposure to increasing interest rates on variable-rate debt.\nThe types of transactions that typically cause the most significant volatility in operating results are as follows:\n\u2022 The wholesale energy operations at SJRG purchases and holds natural gas in storage and maintains capacity on interstate pipelines to earn profit margins in the future. The wholesale energy operations utilize derivatives to mitigate price risk in order to substantially lock-in the profit margin that will ultimately be realized. However, both gas stored in inventory and pipeline capacity are not considered derivatives and are not subject to fair value accounting. Conversely, the derivatives used to reduce the risk associated with a change in the value of inventory and pipeline capacity are accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in operating results in the period of change. As a result, earnings are subject to volatility as the market price of derivatives change, even when the underlying hedged value of inventory and pipeline capacity are unchanged. Additionally, volatility in earnings is created when realized gains and losses on derivatives used to mitigate commodity price risk on expected future purchases of gas injected into storage are recognized in earnings when the derivatives settle, but the cost of the related gas in storage is not recognized in earnings until the period of withdrawal. This volatility can be significant from period to period.\nOver time, gains or losses on the sale of gas in storage, as well as use of capacity, will be offset by losses or gains on the derivatives, resulting in the realization of the profit margin expected when the transactions were initiated.\n\u2022 The retail electric operations at SJE use forward contracts to mitigate commodity price risk on fixed price electric contracts with customers. In accordance with GAAP, the forward contracts are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings in the period of change. Several related customer contracts are not considered derivatives and, therefore, are not recorded in earnings until the electricity is delivered. As a result, earnings are subject to volatility as the market price of the forward contracts change, even when the underlying hedged value of the customer contract is unchanged. Over time, gains or losses on the sale of the fixed price electric under contract will be offset by losses or gains on the forward contracts, resulting in the realization of the profit margin expected when the transactions were initiated.\nAs a result, management also uses the non-GAAP financial measures of Economic Earnings and Economic Earnings Per Share when evaluating its results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP measures, such as net income, operating income, earnings per share from continuing operations or any other GAAP measure of financial performance.\nWe define Economic Earnings as: Income from Continuing Operations, (i) less the change in unrealized gains and plus the change in unrealized losses on non-utility derivative transactions; (ii) less income and plus losses attributable to noncontrolling interest; and (iii) less the impact of transactions, contractual arrangements or other events where management believes period to period comparisons of SJI's operations could be difficult or potentially confusing. With respect to part (iii) of the definition of Economic Earnings, items excluded from Economic Earnings for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, include impairment charges; the impact of pricing disputes with third parties; costs to acquire ETG and ELK; costs incurred and gains recognized on the acquisitions of Annadale (fuel cell projects) and EnerConnex; costs to prepare to exit the transaction service agreement (TSA); costs incurred and gains/losses recognized on sales of solar, MTF/ACB, ELK and SJE's retail gas business; costs incurred to cease operations at three landfill gas-to-energy production facilities; customer credits related to the acquisition of ETG and ELK; ERIP costs; severance and other employee separation costs; and additional tax adjustments including a state deferred valuation allowance and a one-time tax expense resulting from SJG's Stipulation of Settlement with the BPU. See (A)-(H) in the table below.\nEconomic Earnings is a significant financial measure used by our management to indicate the amount and timing of income from continuing operations that we expect to earn after taking into account the impact of derivative instruments on the related transactions, as well as the impact of contractual arrangements and other events that management believes make period to period comparisons of SJI's operations difficult or potentially confusing. Management uses Economic Earnings to manage its business and to determine such items as incentive/compensation arrangements and allocation of resources. Specifically regarding derivatives, we believe that this financial measure indicates to investors the profitability of the entire derivative-related transaction and not just the portion that is subject to mark-to-market valuation under GAAP. We believe that considering only the change in market value on the derivative side of the transaction can produce a false sense as to the ultimate profitability of the total transaction as no change in value is reflected for the non-derivative portion of the transaction.\nEconomic Earnings for 2020 increased $59.9 million, or 58.2%, to $163.0 million compared to 2019. The significant drivers for the overall change were as follows (all numbers in the bullet points below are presented after-tax):\n\u2022The Economic Earnings contribution from gas utility operations at SJG increased $21.9 million to $109.3 million, primarily due to an increase in base rates as the BPU approved the settlement of SJG's rate case petition in September 2020 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), along with customer growth and the roll-in to rates of infrastructure program investments. SJG's utility margin also increased from its CIP mechanism as discussed in \"Utility Margin - SJG Utility Operations\" below. These were partially offset with increases in depreciation and maintenance expenses,\n\u2022The Economic Earnings contribution from on-site energy production at Marina increased $18.1 million to $15.7 million, primarily due to ITC recorded on assets of recently acquired fuel cell and solar projects as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. These were partially offset with depreciation recorded on solar projects previously held for sale and the impact of less earnings from MTF/ACB due to its sale in February 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022The Economic Earnings contribution from the wholesale energy operations at SJRG increased $16.0 million to $24.8 million, primarily due to higher margins on daily energy trading activities, along with a refund received from a third party supplier as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022The Economic Earnings contribution from gas utility operations at ETG increased $13.5 million to $47.7 million, primarily due to positive margins due to favorable changes in base rates resulting from the completion of ETG's rate case in November 2019 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), along with customer growth and lower maintenance expenses. This was partially offset with higher operations and depreciation expenses.\n\u2022Partially offsetting the above items is a $7.3 million increase in financing and interest costs at the SJI level (i.e. excluding SJG and ETG, as these are included in the Economic Earnings contributions noted above) during 2020 compared to 2019. These were primarily due to interest incurred on higher amounts of long-term debt outstanding, along with expenses incurred to terminate SJI's interest rate swaps (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our income from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations to Economic Earnings and Economic Earnings per share (in thousands, except per share data):\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of SJG's income from continuing operations to Economic Earnings:\n\nThe effect of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments under GAAP in the statements of consolidated income (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements) is as follows (gains (losses) in thousands):\n\n(A) Represents impairment charges taken as follows: in 2019 on solar generating facilities along with the agreement to sell MTF and ACB, which were both driven by the expected purchase prices being less than the carrying value of the assets; and in 2018 on solar generating facilities, which was also primarily driven by the purchase price in the agreement to sell solar assets being less than the carrying amount of the assets, along with LFGTE assets, which was primarily driven by the remaining carrying value of these assets no longer being recoverable.\n(B) Represents net losses, including interest, legal fees and the realized difference in the market value of the commodity (including financial hedges) resulting from a ruling in a legal proceeding related to a pricing dispute between SJI and a gas supplier that began in October 2014.\n(C) Represents the following:\n\u2022Costs incurred in 2020 to acquire EnerConnex, Annadale, and four solar LLCs\n\u2022Gain recorded in 2020 on the step-acquisition of EnerConnex\n\u2022Costs incurred and gains/losses recognized in 2020 on the sales of MTF/ACB and ELK\n\u2022Costs incurred and gains recognized in all three periods on the sale of certain solar assets included in Assets Held for Sale in previous periods. The gains pertain to those projects that were not impaired in previous periods.\n\u2022Costs incurred in 2018 on the agreement to acquire the assets of ETG and ELK, and costs incurred in 2019/2020 to prepare to exit the transaction services agreement\n\u2022Costs incurred in 2018 on the sale of the retail gas business of SJE\n(D) Represents credits to ETG and ELK customers that were required as part of the ETG/ELK Acquisition.\n(E) Represents costs incurred on the Company's ERIP as well as the benefit of amending the Company's OPEB.\n(F) Represents severance and other employee separation costs, along with costs incurred to cease operations at three landfill gas-to-energy production facilities.\n(G) The income taxes on (A) through (F) above are determined using a combined average statutory tax rate applicable to each period presented.\n(H) Represents additional tax adjustments, primarily including a state deferred tax valuation allowance at SJI, and a one-time tax expense resulting from SJG's Stipulation of Settlement with the BPU.\nSJI Utilities:\nSJG Utility Operations - The following tables summarize the composition of SJG utility operations operating revenues and Utility Margin for the years ended December 31 (in thousands, except for customer and degree day data):\n\n(A) Does not include amortization of debt issuance costs that are recorded as Interest Charges on the consolidated statements of income.\n(B) Represents pass-through expenses for which there is a corresponding credit in operating revenues. Therefore, such recoveries have no impact on SJG's financial results.\n(C) Utility Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure and is further defined under the caption \"Utility Margin - SJG Utility Operations\" below.\nOperating Revenues - SJG Utility Operations 2020 vs. 2019 - Revenues increased $2.6 million, or 0.4%, during 2020 compared with 2019. Excluding intercompany transactions, revenues increased $0.5 million, or 0.1%, during 2020 compared with 2019.\nThe main driver for the increased revenue was higher firm sales primarily due to customer growth and increase in base rates, partially offset by warmer weather in the first quarter of 2020. While changes in gas costs and BGSS recoveries/refunds fluctuate from period to period, SJG does not profit from the sale of the commodity. Therefore, corresponding fluctuations in Operating Revenue or Cost of Sales have no impact on profitability, as further discussed below under the caption \"Utility Margin.\"\nPartially offsetting these increases was the impact of decreased OSS, which was primarily due to lower commodity costs as a result of lower cash market prices and lower demand, along with warmer weather during the first quarter of 2020. However, the impact of changes in OSS and capacity release activity do not have a material impact on the earnings of SJG, as SJG is required to return the majority of the profits of such activity to its ratepayers.\nUtility Margin - SJG Utility Operations 2020 vs. 2019 - Management uses Utility Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, when evaluating the operating results of SJG. Utility Margin is defined as natural gas revenues plus depreciation and amortization expenses, less natural gas costs, regulatory rider expenses and related volumetric and revenue-based energy taxes. Management believes that Utility Margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than revenues since natural gas costs, regulatory rider expenses and related energy taxes are passed through to customers, and since depreciation and amortization expenses are considered to be administrative. Natural gas costs are charged to operating expenses on the basis of therm sales at the prices approved by the BPU through SJG's BGSS clause. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP measure.\nUtility Margin increased $30.2 million, or 9.5 %, during 2020 compared with 2019. The twelve-month comparative period increase is primarily due to increases in base rates as the BPU approved the settlement of SJG's rate case petition in September 2020 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), along with customer growth and the roll-in to rates of infrastructure program investments Also contributing to the comparative period increase was the CIP tracking mechanism, which adjusts earnings when actual usage per customer experienced during the period varies from an established baseline usage per customer. As reflected in the Utility Margin table above, the CIP mechanism increased Utility Margin in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to variation in customer usage compared to the prior year.\nETG Utility Operations:\nThe following tables summarize the composition of regulated natural gas utility operations, operating revenues and margin at ETG for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and for the post-acquisition period during 2018, which was July 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 (\"post-acquisition period\") (in thousands, except for degree day data):\n\n(A) Does not include amortization of debt issuance costs that are recorded as Interest Charges on the consolidated statements of income.\n(B) Represents pass-through expenses for which there is a corresponding credit in operating revenues. Therefore, such recoveries have no impact on ETG's financial results.\n(C) Utility Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure and is further defined under the caption \"Utility Margin - SJG Utility Operations\" above. The definition of Utility Margin is the same for each of the Utilities.\nETG consists of natural gas distribution to residential, commercial and industrial customers in northern and central New Jersey. ETG's operating revenues consist of firm sales and transportation, as well as interruptible sales and transportation. ETG does not have any off-system sales. The Utility Margin at ETG is considered a non-GAAP measure and calculated the same as SJG as discussed under \"Utility Margin\" above.\nRevenues from the gas utility operations at ETG increased $24.3 million, or 7.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. ETG Utility Margin increased $36.5 million, or 20.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. These increases in revenues and Utility Margin compared to the prior year periods are primarily due to favorable changes in base rates resulting from the completion of ETG's rate case in November 2019, along with customer growth.\nELK Utility Operations - The activities of ELK utility operations are not material to SJI's financial results. On July 31, 2020, SJI, through its wholly-owned subsidiary SJIU, closed on its transaction to sell ELK to a third-party buyer. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Revenues - Energy Group 2020 vs. 2019 - Combined revenues for Energy Group, net of intercompany transactions, decreased $78.2 million, or 11.4%, to $604.8 million, in 2020 compared with 2019. The significant drivers for the overall change were as follows:\n\u2022Revenues from retail electric operations at SJE, net of intercompany transactions, decreased $42.5 million to $33.4 million, primarily due to lower overall sales volumes as SJE chose not to renew several contracts that have expired over the last twelve months. Partially offsetting this decrease was the change in unrealized gains and losses recorded on forward financial contracts due to price volatility, which is excluded for Economic Earnings and represented a total increase of $3.8 million.\nSJE uses forward financial contracts to mitigate commodity price risk on fixed price electric contracts. In accordance with GAAP, the forward financial contracts are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings in the period of change. The related customer contracts are not considered derivatives and, therefore, are not recorded in earnings until the electricity is delivered. As a result, earnings are subject to volatility as the market price of the forward financial contracts change, even when the underlying hedged value of the customer contract is unchanged. Over time, gains or losses on the sale of the fixed price electric under contract will be offset by losses or gains on the forward financial contracts, resulting in the realization of the profit margin expected when the transactions were initiated. The retail electric operations at SJE serve both fixed and market-priced customers.\n\u2022Revenues from wholesale energy operations at SJRG, net of intercompany transactions, decreased $35.8 million to $571.1 million, primarily due to decreases in the average monthly NYMEX settle price, along with maintenance and scheduled outages at several electric generation facilities during the first quarter of 2020. These decreases were partially offset by higher margins on daily energy trading activities, as well as revenues earned on gas supply contracts with two electric generation facilities that began operating in 2020. Also impacting the comparative period revenues was the change in unrealized gains and losses recorded on forward financial contracts due to price volatility, which is excluded for Economic Earnings and represented a total increase of $8.5 million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues and expenses related to the energy trading activities of the wholesale energy operations at SJRG are presented on a net basis in Operating Revenues - Nonutility on the consolidated statement of income.\nOperating Revenues - Energy Services 2020 vs. 2019 - Combined revenues for Energy Services, net of intercompany transactions, decreased $31.9 million, or 66.3%, to $16.2 million in 2020 compared with 2019. The significant drivers for the overall change were as follows:\n\u2022Revenues from on-site energy production at Marina, net of intercompany transactions, decreased $31.9 million to $14.2 million, primarily due to lack of revenues from MTF and ACB subsequent to the sale that was completed February 18, 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022The change in revenues from appliance service operations at SJESP, net of intercompany transactions, was not significant.\nGross Margin - Energy Group & Energy Services - Gross margin for the Energy Group and Energy Services businesses is a GAAP measure and is defined as revenue less all costs that are directly related to the production, sale and delivery of SJI's products and services. These costs primarily include natural gas and electric commodity costs as well as certain payroll and related benefits. On the statements of consolidated income, revenue is reflected in Operating Revenues - Nonutility and the costs are reflected in Cost of Sales - Nonutility. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues and expenses related to the energy trading activities of the wholesale energy operations at SJRG are presented on a net basis in Operating Revenues - Nonutility on the statements of consolidated income.\nGross margin is broken out between Energy Group and Energy Services below, which are each comprised of a group of segments as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nGross Margin - Energy Group 2020 vs. 2019 - Combined gross margins for Energy Group increased $34.2 million to $43.9 million for 2020 compared with 2019. The significant drivers for the overall change were as follows:\n\u2022Gross margin from the wholesale energy operations at SJRG increased $32.9 million to $44.1 million, primarily due to higher margins on daily energy trading activities. Also contributing to the increase was a refund received from a third party gas supplier as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, as well as the change in unrealized gains and losses recorded on forward financial contracts due to price volatility, which is excluded for Economic Earnings and represented a total increase of $8.5 million.\nWe expect the wholesale energy operations at SJRG to continue to add incremental margin from marketing and related opportunities in the Marcellus region, capitalizing on its established presence in the area. Future margins could fluctuate significantly due to the volatile nature of wholesale gas prices. As of December 31, 2020, the wholesale energy operations had 4.6 MMdts of storage and 423,030 dts/d of transportation under contract.\n\u2022Gross margin from SJE's retail electric operations increased $1.1 million to a loss of $0.4 million, primarily due to the change in unrealized gains and losses recorded on forward financial contracts due to price volatility, which is excluded for Economic Earnings and represented a total increase of $3.8 million. Partially offsetting this increase is overall lower sales volumes as SJE did not renew several contracts that have expired over the last twelve months.\nGross Margin - Energy Services 2020 vs. 2019 - Combined gross margins for Energy Services decreased $25.1 million to $15.9 million for 2020 compared with 2019. The significant drivers for the overall change were as follows:\n\u2022Gross margin from on-site energy production at Marina decreased $25.1 million to $13.9 million, primarily due to lack of margin from MTF and ACB subsequent to the sale that was completed February 18, 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\u2022The change in gross margin from appliance service operations at SJESP was not significant.\nOperations Expense - All Segments - A summary of net changes in operations expense follows (in thousands):\n\nThe change in SJG utility operations expense in 2020 compared with 2019 was not significant.\nETG utility operations expense increased $14.0 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to the operation of ETG's RAC, which experienced an aggregate net increase. Such costs are recovered on a dollar-for-dollar basis; therefore, ETG experienced an offsetting increase in revenue compared with the prior year. Also contributing to the increase was higher expenses in various areas, most notably those associated with corporate support.\nCombined operations expense for Energy Group and Energy Services decreased $16.6 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to the sale of MTF and ACB (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nThe Corporate & Services segment had a $2.8 million decrease in Operations Expense in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to less severance and other employee separation costs and less costs incurred to exit the TSA, which occurred in March 2020, along with intercompany eliminations. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in operations expense at SJEI due to the acquisitions of AEP and EnerConnex (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nImpairment Charges - No impairment charges were recorded during 2020. Marina incurred approximately $10.8 million of impairment charges during 2019 related to the expected purchase price of two of the unsold solar sites being less than their carrying value, along with charges resulting from the purchase price in the agreement to sell MTF and ACB being less than its carrying value (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). These impairment charges were recorded in the On-Site Energy Production segment.\nMaintenance Expense - Maintenance expense increased $1.5 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to increased maintenance of services activity and higher levels of RAC amortization at SJG. This increase in RAC-related expenses does not affect earnings, as SJG recognizes an offsetting amount in revenues. This increase at SJG was partially offset by lower repair expenses at ETG in 2020 compared with 2019.\nDepreciation Expense - Depreciation expense increased $19.0 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to increased investment in property, plant and equipment by the gas utility operations of SJG and ETG, along with depreciation recorded on solar projects previously held for sale. This was partially offset by the MTF & ACB sale (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nEnergy and Other Taxes - The change in Energy and Other Taxes in 2020 compared with 2019 was not significant.\nNet Gain on Sales of Assets - During 2020, the Company recognized $1.1 million in net gains on the sale of MTF and ACB, $0.8 million on the sale of assets related to solar projects and $0.7 million on the sale of ELK. During 2019, the Company recognized $3.1 million in net gains on the sale of assets related to solar projects, with these gains pertaining to those projects that were not impaired as discussed above. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOther Income and Expense - Other income and expense increased $3.8 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to the step acquisition gain recorded in connection with the EnerConnex acquisition (see Notes 1 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements), along with higher AFUDC income at SJG and ETG.\nInterest Charges - Interest charges increased $4.1 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to interest incurred on higher amounts of long-term debt outstanding at SJI and SJG.\nIncome Taxes - Income tax expense increased $1.6 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes in 2020 compared with the prior year along with a state deferred tax valuation allowance recorded (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). These were partially offset with the benefits from ITC recorded on the assets of recently acquired fuel cell and solar projects that commenced operations in 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\nEquity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies - The change in equity in earnings of affiliated companies in 2020 compared with 2019 was not significant.\nDiscontinued Operations - The losses are primarily comprised of environmental remediation and product liability litigation associated with previously disposed of businesses.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES:\nFor information on the changes in liquidity and capital resources from 2019 compared to 2018, refer to the Management Discussion & Analysis section in Item 7 of SJI's and SJG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity needs are driven by factors that include natural gas commodity prices; the impact of weather on customer bills; lags in fully collecting gas costs from customers under the BGSS charge and other regulatory clauses; settlement of legal matters; environmental remediation expenditures through the RAC; working capital needs of SJI's energy trading and marketing activities; the timing of construction and remediation expenditures and related permanent financings; the timing of equity contributions to unconsolidated affiliates; mandated tax payment dates; both discretionary and required repayments of long-term debt; acquisitions; and the amounts and timing of dividend payments.\nCash flows for the years ended December 31, were as follows (in thousands):\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities - Liquidity needs are first met with net cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities varies from year-to-year primarily due to the impact of weather on customer demand and related gas purchases, customer usage factors related to conservation efforts and the price of the natural gas commodity, inventory utilization, and gas cost recoveries. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2020 produced more net cash than 2019, primarily due to the following: (1) cash payments related to a legal proceeding of a pricing dispute which were paid during 2019 and did not recur in 2020 (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements); (2) a refund from a third party gas supplier that was received in July 2020 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements); (3) higher ETG revenues due to favorable changes in base rates resulting from the completion of ETG's rate case in November 2019 (see \"ETG Utility Operations\"); (4) higher margins and increased collections on daily energy trading activities at SJRG; and (5) customer growth and lower costs experienced at SJG for environmental remediation. These increases were partially offset by SJI terminating its interest rate swaps in December 2020 at a price of $8.2 million (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\nCash Flows from Investing Activities - SJI has a continuing need for cash resources and capital, primarily to invest in new and replacement facilities and equipment. We estimate the cash outflows for investing activities, net of refinancings and returns/advances on investments from affiliates, for 2021, 2022 and 2023 to be approximately $686.4 million, $625.1 million and $624.8 million, respectively. The high level of investing activities for 2021, 2022 and 2023 is due to the accelerated infrastructure investment programs and future capital expenditures at SJG and ETG, projected investment in PennEast, and investments in future renewable energy projects. SJI expects to use short-term borrowings under lines of credit from commercial banks and a commercial paper program to finance these investing activities as incurred. From time to time, SJI may refinance the short-term debt with long-term debt.\nOther significant investing activities of SJI during 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n\u2022In 2020, SJI received approximately $119.8 million in total from the sales of MTF and ACB, ELK and a solar project. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022In 2020, SJI paid approximately $21.6 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of EnerConnex, the renewable natural gas development rights in certain dairy farms and four solar LLCs. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022In 2020, SJI paid $80.2 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire a 93% ownership interest in Annadale. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022SJI made net investments in unconsolidated affiliates of $28.9 million, $8.3 million and $6.6 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Included in 2020 is SJI's acquisition of its 35% ownership interest in REV LNG and capital contribution loans made to REV LNG. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022SJI received approximately $26.8 million and $310.6 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, from the sale of certain solar assets along with the sale of SJE's retail gas operations (2018). See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022In 2019, SJI received $15.6 million as an adjustment to the purchase price related to the ETG/ELK Acquisition.\n\u2022In 2019, SJI paid $4.0 million to acquire AEP. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022In 2018, SJI paid $11.3 million to enter into a new asset management agreement. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022In 2018, SJI paid approximately $1.7 billion for the ETG/ELK Acquisition. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities - SJI supplements its operating cash flow, commercial paper program and credit lines with both debt and equity capital to support working capital needs and to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions as incurred.\nSJG has a commercial paper program under which SJG may issue short-term, unsecured promissory notes to qualified investors up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $200.0 million. The notes have fixed maturities which vary by note, but may not exceed 270 days from the date of issue. Proceeds from the notes are used for general corporate purposes. SJG uses the commercial paper program in tandem with its $200.0 million revolving credit facility and the principal amount of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the credit facility cannot exceed an aggregate of $200.0 million.\nOver the years, SJG has used long-term debt, primarily in the form of First Mortgage Bonds and MTN's, secured by the same pool of utility assets, to finance its long-term borrowing needs. These needs are primarily capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment.\nCredit facilities and available liquidity as of December 31, 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\n\n(A) Includes letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $9.6 million, which is used to enable SJE to market retail electricity as well as for various construction and operating activities.\n(B) Includes letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $0.8 million, which supports the remediation of environmental conditions at certain locations in SJG's service territory.\n(C) Includes letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $1.0 million, which supports ETG's construction activity.\n(D) These facilities were renewed in 2020.\nFor SJI and SJG, the amount of usage shown in the table above, less the letters of credit noted in (A)-(C) for SJI and (B) only for SJG above, equals the amounts recorded as Notes Payable on the respective consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020.\nBased upon the existing credit facilities and a regular dialogue with our banks, we believe there will continue to be sufficient credit available to meet our business' future liquidity needs.\nEach of the credit facilities are provided by a syndicate of banks. The NPA for Senior Unsecured Notes issued by SJI, and the Utilities' credit facilities, contain a financial covenant limiting the ratio of indebtedness to total capitalization (as defined in the respective NPA or credit agreement) to not more than 0.70 to 1, measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. SJI and the Utilities were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2020. For SJI, the equity units are treated as equity (as opposed to how they are classified on the consolidated balance sheet, as long-term debt; see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements) for purposes of the covenant calculation.\nAlthough there can be no assurance, management believes that actions presently being taken to pay off or refinance the short-term debt and borrowings that are due within the next year will be successful, as the Company has been successful in refinancing debt in the past. No adjustments have been made to the financial statements to account for this uncertainty.\nFor additional information regarding the terms of the credit facilities as well as weighted average interest rates, average borrowings outstanding and maximum amounts outstanding under these credit facilities see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOther Financing Activity - 2020\nDebt Issuances/Paydowns:\nOn March 26, 2020, SJI entered into an unsecured $150.0 million term loan agreement, which bears interest at variable rates. The maturity date of the term loan is March 25, 2021, and the loan is recorded in Notes Payable on the consolidated balance sheets. The proceeds of the loan were used for general corporate purposes.\nOn April 3, 2020, SJI entered into an unsecured $200.0 million term loan credit agreement, which bears interest at variable rates. Proceeds from the debt were used to pay down the following:\n\u2022$50.0 million outstanding on the SJI revolving credit facility, which was previously recorded in Notes Payable on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\u2022$100.0 million SJI Term Loan, which was previously recorded in Notes Payable on the consolidated balance sheets and due to mature in September 2020.\n\u2022$50.0 million SJI variable rate note, which was previously recorded in current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOn April 16, 2020, SJG entered into a NPA which provided for SJG to issue and sell its Senior Secured Notes, Series F, 2020 in the aggregate principal amount of $525.0 million in three Tranches; Tranche A and B totaled $400.0 million and were issued on April 16, 2020 while Tranche C of $125.0 million was issued on October 1, 2020. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. On April 26, 2020, SJG used proceeds from Tranche A and B to pay off $400.0 million principal amount outstanding on its term loan credit agreement, which was previously recorded in current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. SJG used the Tranche C proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nOn May 27, 2020, SJI entered into a NPA which provided for the Company to issue an aggregate of $200.0 million of senior unsecured notes in two tranches, both of which were issued on July 30, 2020. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. The proceeds from these issuances were used to pay off the unsecured $200.0 million term loan credit agreement issued in April 2020 discussed above, which was paid off on July 31, 2020.\nIn September 2020, SJG paid off $10.0 million of the principal balance outstanding on its 3.00% MTNs. In November 2020, SJG paid off $7.0 million of the principal balance outstanding on its 3.03% MTNs.\nSJG makes payments of $0.9 million annually through December 2025 toward the principal amount of 3.63% MTNs, including a payment made in 2020.\nOn November 10, 2020, ETG entered into a Bond Purchase Agreement which provided for ETG to issue an aggregate of $250.0 million of first mortgage bonds in 5 tranches. The first two tranches totaled $125.0 million and were issued on November 10, 2020, while the final three tranches totaling $125.0 million are expected to be issued on June 15, 2021. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\nEquity Activity:\nIn April 2020, SJI entered into an ATM Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the \"Sales Agreement\") to sell, from time to time, shares of the Company's common stock, par value $1.25 per share, having an aggregate sale price up to $200.0 million, through an at-the-market\u201d equity offering program. Pursuant to the Sales Agreement, the shares of common stock were to be offered and sold through any of the named sales agents in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be at-the-market\u201d offerings. In June 2020, 8,122,283 shares were sold pursuant to the Sales Agreement at an average market price of approximately $24.62 for total net proceeds of $198.0 million after deducting commissions and other general & administrative expenses. These sales exhausted the shares that were available for sale under the Sales Agreement. The Company is using the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes.\nOn October 16, 2020, SJI filed an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation that increased the authorized number of shares of its common stock from 120,000,000 to 220,000,000 and the aggregate number of shares authorized to be issued by SJI from 122,500,000 to 222,500,000.\nOther Financing Activity - 2019\nProceeds from the Sale of Common Stock\nSJI settled its equity forward sale agreement (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements) by delivering 6,779,661 shares of common stock and receiving net cash proceeds of approximately $189.0 million. The forward price used to determine cash proceeds received by SJI at settlement was calculated based on the initial forward sale price, as adjusted for underwriting fees, interest rate adjustments as specified in the equity forward agreement and any dividends paid on our common stock during the forward period.\nDebt Issuances:\nSJI offered and sold $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.625% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2079. The total net cash proceeds, inclusive of a debt discount of $5.3 million, were $194.7 million.\nETG entered into a Bond Purchase Agreement and issued First Mortgage Bonds, Series 2019A-1 through Series 2019A-4, in the aggregate principal amount of $145.0 million. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2019, SJG borrowed $400.0 million on its term loan credit agreement, including borrowing the remaining $90.0 million (which was available as of December 31, 2018) in 2019. All loans under this term loan credit agreement were paid on April 26, 2020 as noted above.\nDebt Repayments:\nSJI repaid $475.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding on its Floating Rate Senior Notes, Series 2018D.\nSJI paid off the following: $60.0 million principal amount outstanding on its 3.30% Senior Notes, Series 2014A-1; $40.0 million principal amount outstanding on its Floating Rate Senior Notes, Series 2014B-1; $30.0 million principal amount outstanding on its 3.30% Senior Notes, Series 2014A-2; $50.0 million principal amount outstanding on its 3.30% Senior Notes, Series 2014A-3; and $60.0 million principal amount outstanding on its Floating Rate Senior Notes, Series 2014B-2.\nSJG retired $10.0 million of 5.587% MTN's.\nSJG paid $8.0 million in November 2019 that was due on its 4.01% MTN's,\nDRP - See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE - SJI's capital structure was as follows:\n\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, SJI paid quarterly dividends to its common shareholders. SJI has a long history of paying dividends on its common stock and has increased its dividend every year since 1999. SJI's current long-term goals are to grow the dividend at a rate consistent with earnings growth over the long term, subject to the approval of its Board of Directors, with a long-term targeted payout ratio of between 55% and 65% of Economic Earnings. In setting the dividend rate, the Board of Directors of SJI considers future earnings expectations, payout ratio, and dividend yield relative to those at peer companies, as well as returns available on other income-oriented investments. However, there can be no assurance that SJI will be able to continue to increase the dividend, meet the targeted payout ratio or pay a dividend at all in the future.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:\nENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION - Costs for remediation projects, net of recoveries from ratepayers, for 2020, 2019 and 2018 amounted to net cash outflows of $19.3 million, $49.2 million and $59.3 million, respectively. These include environmental remediation liabilities of ETG associated with five former manufactured gas plant sites in New Jersey which are recoverable from customers through rate mechanisms approved by the BPU. See the Contractual Cash Obligations Table below for the total expected net cash outflows for remediation projects for future years. As discussed in Notes 10, 11 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, certain environmental costs are subject to recovery from ratepayers.\nSTANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT - See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCONVERTIBLE UNITS - The Company has a contract obligating the holder of the units to purchase from the Company, and for the Company to sell to the holder for a price in cash of $50, a certain number of shares of common stock. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS - SJG and SJRG have certain commitments for both pipeline capacity and gas supply for which they pay fees regardless of usage. Those commitments as of December 31, 2020, average $96.7 million annually and total $760.5 million over the contracts' lives. Approximately 38% of the financial commitments under these contracts expire during the next five years. These contracts are included in SJI's contractual obligations below. We expect to renew each of these contracts under renewal provisions as provided in each contract. SJG recovers all prudently incurred fees through rates via the BGSS clause.\nIn addition, in the normal course of business, SJG and SJRG have entered into long-term contracts for natural gas supplies. SJRG has committed to purchase 721,900 dts/d of natural gas, from various suppliers, for terms ranging from five to eleven years at index-based prices. SJG has committed to a purchase of a minimum of 15,000 dts/d and up to 70,000 dts/d, from a supplier for a term of ten years at index-based prices. Also, in 2019 SJG entered into a two-year purchase agreement with a producer delivering 5,000 dts/day at SJG's Leidy Line for certified responsible gas from November 1, 2019 through October 31, 2021. The obligations for these purchases have not been included in the contractual obligations table below because the actual volumes and prices are not fixed.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations, in addition to those related to our usage of short-term borrowings under our credit facilities discussed above, and their applicable payment due dates as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\n\nLong-Term Debt in the table above does not include unamortized debt issuance costs of $29.6 million and unamortized debt discounts of $5.2 million, which are recorded as an offset to Long-Term Debt on the consolidated balance sheets.\nInterest on long-term debt in the table above includes the related interest obligations through maturity on all outstanding long-term debt. Expected asset retirement obligations and the liability for unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the table above as the total obligation cannot be calculated due to the subjective nature of these costs and timing of anticipated payments. SJI did not make contributions to its employee pension plans in 2020. Future pension contributions cannot be determined at this time. SJG's regulatory obligation to contribute $3.7 million annually to its postretirement benefit plans' trusts, as discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, is also not included as its duration is indefinite.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS - An off-balance sheet arrangement is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which SJI has either made guarantees or has certain other interests or obligations.\nSee \"Guarantees\" in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail.\nNOTES RECEIVABLE-AFFILIATES - See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\nLITIGATION - SJI and SJG are subject to claims, actions and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Neither SJI nor SJG can make any assurance as to the outcome of any of these actions but, based on an analysis of these claims and consultation with outside counsel, we do not believe that any of these claims, other than those described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the business or financial statements of SJI or SJG. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail on these claims.\nSOUTH JERSEY GAS COMPANY\nThis section of Management's Discussion focuses on SJG for the reported periods. In many cases, explanations and disclosures for both SJI and SJG are substantially the same or specific disclosures for SJG are included in the Management's Discussion for SJI.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS:\nFor information on the changes in SJG's results of operations from 2019 compared to 2018, refer to the Management Discussion & Analysis section in Item 7 of SJI's and SJG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe results of operations for the SJG utility operations are described above; therefore, this section primarily focuses on statistical information and other information that is not discussed in the results of operations under South Jersey Industries, Inc. Refer to the section entitled Results of Operations - SJG Utility Operations\u201d for a discussion of the results of operations for SJG.\nThe following table summarizes the composition of selected gas utility throughput for the years ended December 31, (in thousands, except for degree day data):\n\n*Each day, each degree of average daily temperature below 65 degrees Fahrenheit is counted as one heating degree-day. Annual degree-days is the sum of the daily totals.\nThroughput - Gas Utility Operations 2020 vs. 2019 - Total gas throughput decreased 23.6 MMdts, or 15%, in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to decreases in capacity release, which was due to warmer than normal weather that impacted the winter season and created less demand in SJG service territory. In addition, the decrease is the result of specific segmented releases on the Transco pipeline which were lower in 2020 compared to 2019.\nOperating Revenues & Utility Margin - See SJI's Management Discussion section above.\nOperations Expense - See SJI's Management Discussion section above.\nMaintenance Expense - See SJI's Management Discussion section above.\nDepreciation Expense - Depreciation expense increased $5.1 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to continuing investment in utility plant. The increased spending in recent years is a direct result of New Jersey's infrastructure improvement efforts, which included the approval of SJG's AIRP and SHARP, in addition to significant investment in new technology systems.\nEnergy and Other Taxes - The change in Energy and Other Taxes in 2020 compared with 2019 was not significant.\nOther Income and Expense - Other Income and Expense increased $1.2 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to higher AFUDC income.\nInterest Charges - Interest charges increased $1.7 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to higher amounts of long-term debt outstanding (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements).\nIncome Taxes - Income tax expense generally fluctuates as income before taxes changes. Minor variations will occur period to period as a result of effective tax rate adjustments.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES:\nFor information on the changes in SJG's liquidity and capital resources from 2019 compared to 2018, refer to the Management Discussion & Analysis section in Item 7 of SJI's and SJG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity and capital resources for SJG are substantially covered in the Management's Discussion of SJI (except for the items and transactions that relate to SJI and its nonutility subsidiaries). Those explanations are incorporated by reference into this discussion.\nLiquidity needs for SJG are driven by factors that include natural gas commodity prices; the impact of weather on customer bills; lags in fully collecting gas costs from customers under the BGSS charge, settlement of legal matters, and environmental remediation expenditures through the RAC; the timing of construction and remediation expenditures and related permanent financings; mandated tax payment dates; both discretionary and required repayments of long-term debt; and the amounts and timing of dividend payments.\nCash flows for the year ended December 31 were the following (in thousands):\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities - Liquidity needs are first met with net cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities varies from year-to-year primarily due to the impact of weather on customer demand and related gas purchases, customer usage factors related to conversion efforts and the price of the natural gas commodity, inventory utilization, and gas cost recoveries. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2020 produced more net cash than 2019, primarily due to a cash payment related to a legal proceeding of a pricing dispute which was paid during the third quarter of 2019 (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements) and did not recur in 2020, along with customer growth and lower costs for environmental remediation.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities - SJG has a continuing need for cash resources for capital expenditures, primarily to invest in new and replacement facilities and equipment. SJG estimates the net cash outflows for capital expenditures for fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023 to be approximately $256.8 million, $240.2 million and $325.1 million, respectively. For capital expenditures, including those under the AIRP, SHARP and IIP, SJG expects to use short-term borrowings under both its commercial paper program and lines of credit from commercial banks to finance capital expenditures as incurred. From time to time, SJG may refinance the short-term debt incurred to support capital expenditures with long-term debt.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities - SJG supplements its operating cash flow and credit lines with both debt and equity capital. Over the years, SJG has used long-term debt, primarily in the form of First Mortgage Bonds and MTNs, secured by the same pool of utility assets, to finance its long-term borrowing needs. These needs are primarily capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment.\nCash dividends were not declared or paid by SJG to SJI in 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nSJG received $109.5 million in equity contributions from SJI in 2020; there were no equity contributions to SJG in 2019 or 2018. Future equity contributions will occur on an as needed basis.\nFor information on other financing activities at SJG, see the SJI Management & Discussion Analysis above.\nCapital Structure - SJG's capital structure was as follows:\n\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:\nCosts for remediation projects, net of recoveries from ratepayers, for 2020, 2019 and 2018, amounted to net cash outflows of $27.2 million, $42.7 million and $53.7 million, respectively. See the Contractual Cash Obligations Table below for the total expected net cash outflows for remediation projects for future years. As discussed in Notes 10, 11 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, environmental remediation costs are subject to recovery from ratepayers.\nSJG has certain commitments for both pipeline capacity and gas supply for which SJG pays fees regardless of usage. Those commitments, as of December 31, 2020, averaged $80.5 million annually and totaled $387.1 million over the contracts' lives. Approximately 35% of the financial commitments under these contracts expire during the next five years. SJG expects to renew each of these contracts under renewal provisions as provided in each contract. SJG recovers all such prudently incurred fees through rates via the BGSS.\nSee SJI's Contractual Obligations discussion related to SJG's long-term contracts for natural gas supplies which are not included in the table below.\nThe following table summarizes SJG's contractual cash obligations and their applicable payment due dates as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\n\nLong-Term Debt in the table above does not include unamortized debt issuance costs of $9.4 million, which are recorded as an offset to Long-Term Debt on the balance sheets.\nInterest on long-term debt in the table above includes the related interest obligations through maturity on all outstanding long-term debt.\nExpected asset retirement obligations and the liability for unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the table above as the total obligation cannot be calculated due to the subjective nature of these costs and timing of anticipated payments.\nSJG did not make a pension plan contribution in 2020. Future pension contributions cannot be determined at this time. SJG's regulatory obligation to contribute $3.7 million annually to its postretirement benefit plans' trusts, as discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, is also not included as its duration is indefinite.\nLitigation - See SJG's disclosure in the Commitments and Contingencies section of SJI's Management Discussion above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements - SJG has no off-balance sheet arrangements.", "item_7_tables": "Table 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

the management's discussion and analysis report:\n\n- SJI's income from continuing operations increased $80.1 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by higher contributions from its wholesale energy, gas utility, and on-site energy production operations. Economic earnings also increased $59.9 million.\n\n- SJG's utility margin increased $30.2 million in 2020 compared to 2019, largely due to an increase in base rates from a recent rate case settlement, customer growth, and infrastructure investment roll-ins. \n\n- ETG's utility margin increased $36.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019, mainly attributable to favorable base rate changes from its completed rate case and customer growth.\n\n- Cash flows from operations increased in 2020 primarily due to the non-recurrence of a 2019 legal settlement payment, a gas supplier refund received in 2020, and higher revenues and margins at the utilities. \n\n- Capital expenditures are projected to remain high over the next few years to fund accelerated infrastructure upgrades at the utilities. Debt and equity financing will fund investments.\n\n- The utilities' financial positions remain sound, with SJG's equity-to-capitalization ratio at 49.0% in 2019 and 53.8% in 2020. Regulated cost recovery mechanisms also help support financial stability.\n\nIn summary, SJI's financial performance improved in 2020 driven by base rate increases at its utilities and higher margins from its wholesale energy and on-site energy production businesses. The company plans to continue making significant infrastructure investments at its utilities over the next few years."}
