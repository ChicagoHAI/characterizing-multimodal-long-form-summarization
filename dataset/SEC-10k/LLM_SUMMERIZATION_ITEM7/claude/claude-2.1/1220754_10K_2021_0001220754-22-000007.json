Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements, as discussed in Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nOverview of Our Business\nPlease refer to Item 1. Business\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our services and corporate strategy.\nModivCare Inc. (\"ModivCare\" or the \"Company\") is a technology-enabled healthcare services company that provides a suite of integrated supportive care solutions for public and private payors and their patients. Its value-based solutions address the social determinants of health, or SDoH, enable greater access to care, reduce costs, and improve outcomes. ModivCare is a provider of non-emergency medical transportation, or NEMT, personal care, and remote patient monitoring, or RPM, solutions. The technology-enabled operating model includes NEMT core competencies in risk underwriting, contact center management, network credentialing, claims management and non-emergency medical transportation management. Additionally, its personal care services include placements of non-medical personal care assistants, home health aides and nurses primarily to Medicaid patient populations in need of care monitoring and assistance performing daily living activities in the home setting, including senior citizens and disabled adults. ModivCare's remote patient monitoring services include personal emergency response systems, vitals monitoring and data-driven patient engagement solutions. ModivCare is further expanding its offerings to include meal delivery and working with communities to provide food-insecure individuals delivery of meals.\nModivCare's solutions help health plans manage risks, close care gaps, reduce costs, and connect members to care. Through the combination of its historical NEMT business, its in-home personal care business that consists of Simplura Health Group and Care Finders Total Care LLC, and its recent addition of the remote patient monitoring business through its acquisition of VRI Intermediate Holdings, LLC, ModivCare has united four complementary healthcare businesses that serve similar, highly vulnerable patient populations.\nModivCare also holds a 43.6% minority interest in CCHN Group Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, which operates under the Matrix Medical Network brand and which we refer to as Matrix\u201d. Matrix maintains a national network of community-based clinicians who deliver in-home and on-site services, and a fleet of mobile health clinics that provide community-based care with advanced diagnostic capabilities and enhanced care options. Matrix's clinical care business (\"Clinical Care\") provides risk adjustment solutions that improve health outcomes for individuals and financial performance for health plans. Matrix's clinical solutions business (\"Clinical Solutions\") provides employee health and wellness services focused on improving employee health with worksite certification solutions that reinforce business resilience and safe return-to-work outcomes. Its Clinical Solutions offerings also provide clinical trial services which support the delivery of safe and effective decentralized clinical trial operations to patients and eligible volunteers. Matrix also provides lab services, including services related to COVID-19 such as screening, testing, and vaccinations.\nBusiness Outlook and Trends\nOur performance is affected by a number of trends that drive the demand for our services. In particular, the markets in which we operate are exposed to various trends, such as healthcare industry and demographic dynamics. Over the long term, we believe there are numerous factors that could affect growth within the industries in which we operate, including:\n\u2022an aging population, which is expected to increase demand for healthcare services and transportation and, accordingly, in-home personal care services;\n\u2022increasing prevalence of chronic illnesses that require active and ongoing monitoring of health data which can be accomplished at a lower cost and result in better health outcomes through remote patient monitoring services;\n\u2022a movement towards value-based care versus fee-for-service and cost plus care and budget pressure on governments, both of which may increase the use of private corporations to provide necessary and innovative services;\n\u2022increasing demand for in-home care provision, driven by cost pressures on traditional reimbursement models and technological advances enabling remote engagement, including remote monitoring and similar internet-based health related services;\n\u2022technological advancements, which may be utilized by us to improve services and lower costs, but may also be utilized by others, which may increase industry competitiveness; and\n\u2022MCO, Medicaid and Medicare plans increasingly are covering NEMT services for a variety of reasons, including increased access to care, improved patient compliance with treatment plans, social trends, and to promote SDoH, and this trend may be accelerated or reinforced by The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (\"H.R.133\"), a component of which mandates that state Medicaid programs ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries have necessary transportation to and from health care providers.\nSince March 2020 and primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have observed a material reduction in trip volume in our NEMT segment as a result of state imposed public health orders, many of which reduced medical services to life-sustaining programs only (for example, dialysis and chemotherapy). This reduction in trip volume has had a negative financial impact on our transportation providers and may impact the availability of transportation providers in the future given the heightened sanitation requirements imposed on drivers and depressed volume.\nOur Personal Care segment business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience a material reduction in volume of service hours and visits. Volume has been reduced as members put services on hold due to infection concerns, and/or because they had the alternative of receiving care from family members and other caregivers working remotely or furloughed from their jobs. Cases have also been lost due to patient deaths, and new case referrals slowed as referral sources faced disruption from the various restrictions and public health orders. Our personal care service volumes are not expected to recover to pre-pandemic levels until the vaccination status of members in the markets where we provide services is at a higher rate where individuals feel comfortable receiving care and any current or future COVID-19 variants do not jeopardize the safety of vaccinated members. These depressed volumes will continue to result in lower than expected revenue, at least in the near term, in the Personal Care segment.\nOur RPM segment has not experienced a direct material impact to operations or financial activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While this segment of the business has proven resilient given the increase in demand for remote healthcare services in a highly contagious infection environment, potential risks could arise that could have a material impact on the financial results of the segment. Specifically, given the strain on the healthcare professionals that serve the healthcare community, we could experience shortages in qualified medical professionals that support our remote care monitoring business.\nFurthermore, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is continuously evolving, and the continuation of the pandemic, any additional resurgence, or COVID-19 variants could continue to change trends in the market.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. We base our estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThere are certain critical estimates that require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:\n\u2022it requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made; and\n\u2022changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAccrued Transportation Costs\nDescription. We generally pay our transportation providers for completed trips based on documentation submitted after services have been provided. The transportation service is initiated at the time a member submits a request for transportation services from our providers. At this time, we calculate an estimated transportation cost for each trip based on historical experience and contractual terms. This portion of the accrued transportation cost is based on requests for services we have received and the amount we expect to be billed by our transportation providers. All completed trips (both unbilled and billed) for which we have not yet issued payment reconcile to our total accrued transportation cost, however the critical\naccounting estimate that requires significant judgment is the portion of the accrual that is estimated at initiation of the member request.\nJudgments and Uncertainties. The transportation cost accrual requires significant judgment as it is calculated using contractual rates and mileage estimates, as well as an estimated rate for unknown cancellations given that members may have requested transportation without yet notifying the Company of cancellation. Based upon historical trip experience and contractual terms, we estimate the amount of transportation cost incurred for invoices which have not yet been submitted. The estimates are routinely monitored and compared to actual invoiced costs. Actual cost could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to facts and circumstances that differ from historical trends.\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change. The estimates for the transportation accrual are developed using assumptions based on the best information available to the Company at the time, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result, actual results may differ significantly from estimates. In determining our estimate each period, we use data around historical trip experience, current contractual rates, and mileage estimates and use a third party consultant to assist in development of the expected accrual. Our December 31, 2021 estimated portion of the accrued transportation costs was $3.5 million greater than our estimated portion in 2020 and $2.2 million less than our estimated portion in 2019. The decrease from 2019 to 2021 was a result of the overall decrease in trip volume during the COVID 19 pandemic. The assumptions used in the estimate inputs include estimated trip costs and estimated trip volume. If we were to assume that our estimate of future transportation costs was changed to the upper end or lower end of the range we developed in the course of formulating our estimate, the estimate for future transportation costs as of December 31, 2021 would range from $19.6 million to $23.9 million.\nBusiness Combinations\nDescription. We account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions at the date of acquisition as we allocate the value of the consideration assigned to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any excess purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Additionally, the economic lives assigned to the identifiable intangible assets requires significant judgments from management.\nJudgments and Uncertainties. When determining the fair value of the purchase price to be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, valuation techniques such as the income, cost, or market approach are used and third-party valuation experts are often consulted to assist in the calculation of fair value. Measurement of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on available historical information and expectations and assumptions about future performance. Critical assumptions that require estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimates and assumptions used in determining net future cash flows and the selection of respective discount rates.\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change. Estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result, actual results may differ significantly from estimates.\nOn November 18, 2020, the Company acquired Simplura for $569.8 million. The significant intangible assets identified include the payor network and the trade name. The payor network was determined to have a fair value of $221.0 million and was calculated using the multi-period excess earnings method which includes assumptions on the customer attrition rate, revenue growth rates, and discount rate. The trade name was determined to have a fair value of $43.0 million and was calculated using the relief-from-royalty method which includes assumptions on the revenue projections, royalty rates, and discount rates. Management used a third-party valuation specialist to assist in the allocation of fair value and believes the estimates applied are based upon reasonable assumptions, but understands that estimates of significant assumptions could change resulting in potential impairment losses in the future.\nOn September 14, 2021, the Company acquired Care Finders for $344.8 million. The significant intangible asset identified was the payor network. The payor network was determined to have a fair value of $97.2 million and was calculated using the multi-period excess earnings method which includes assumptions on customer attrition rate, revenue growth rates, and discount rate. Management used a third-party valuation specialist to assist in the allocation of fair value and believes the estimates applied are based upon reasonable assumptions, but understands that estimates of significant assumptions could change resulting in potential impairment losses in the future.\nOn September 22, 2021, the Company acquired VRI for $317.5 million. The significant intangible asset identified was the payor network. The payor network was determined to have a fair value of $72.2 million and was calculated using the multi-period excess earnings method which includes assumptions on customer attrition rate, revenue growth rates, and discount rate. Management used a third-party valuation specialist to assist in the allocation of fair value and believes the estimates applied are\nbased upon reasonable assumptions, but understands that estimates around significant assumptions could change resulting in potential impairment losses in the future.\nRecoverability of Goodwill\nDescription. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, we review goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to: (1) the loss or modification of significant contracts, (2) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (3) unanticipated competition, (4) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, or (5) a significant decline in our stock price. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1. Goodwill is allocated across the Company's reporting units: NEMT, Simplura, Care Finders, and VRI. We first perform qualitative assessments for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment suggests that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value amount, we then perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value is determined to exceed the estimated fair value, the asset is considered impaired.\nJudgments and Uncertainties. When performing a quantitative assessment to estimate the fair value of the Company's goodwill, the Company applies the discounted cash flow method which includes assumptions on the projected future cash flows, earnings, discount rates, working capital adjustments, long-term growth rates, and others.\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change. The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill may result in a different value recorded, which could result in an impairment charge that has the potential to have a material impact to the consolidated statement of operations. As of the date of our annual goodwill analysis, no goodwill impairment charges were recorded.\nIncome Taxes\nDescription. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, we record income tax expense for the amount of taxes payable or refundable in the current period and deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax reporting purposes. We determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, and we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in our current tax returns.\nJudgments and Uncertainties. Significant assumptions, judgments, and estimates are made by management when determining the income tax provision (benefit) for the current year, the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recorded, and the necessary valuation allowance to be recorded against the deferred tax asset. These judgements include interpretations of income tax regulations, estimates of future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and the likelihood of recovery of deferred tax assets or that a tax position will be sustained upon audit.\nWe consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes. We may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates.\nWe record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in our current tax returns. The determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position, taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position, based on technical merits, will be sustained upon examination. For those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not the position will be sustained, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. The difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability. While the Company believes all of its tax positions are fully supportable, the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded.\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change. If there are any changes in the underlying estimates and assumptions to calculate the current period income tax provision or deferred tax assets and liabilities, or if the settlement of tax issues from a current period audit results in a tax position that is no longer supported, the financial statements could be materially impacted. During the period ended December 31, 2021, the Company had recorded $0.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, in other long-term liabilities.\nResults of Operations\nThe following results of operations include the accounts of ModivCare and our subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The results of Care Finders Total Care and VRI Intermediate Holdings, LLC, have been included since the November 14, 2021 and November 22, 2021 acquisition dates, respectively. For our results of operations at December 31, 2019 see Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021.\nRevenues\nService revenue, net. Service revenue for our NEMT segment includes contracts predominately with state Medicaid agencies and MCOs for the coordination of their members' non-emergency transportation needs. Most contracts are capitated, which means we are paid on a per-member, per-month basis for each eligible member. For most contracts, we arrange for transportation of members through our network of independent transportation providers, whereby we negotiate rates and remit payment to the transportation providers. However, for certain contracts, we assume no risk for the transportation network, credentialing and/or payments to these providers. For these contracts, we only provide administrative management services to support the customers' efforts to serve their clients.\nCertain other contracts are structured as fee-for-service (\"FFS\") in which we bill and collect a specified amount for each service that we provide. FFS revenue is recognized in the period in which the services are rendered and is reduced by the estimated impact of contractual allowances and policy discounts in the case of third-party payors.\nService revenue for our Personal Care segment includes hours incurred by our in-home caregivers that are billed to our customers. Our customers consist of third-party payors including, but not limited to, MCOs, hospitals, Medicaid agencies and programs and other home health care providers who subcontract the services of our caregivers.\nService revenue for our RPM segment includes the sale of monitoring equipment to our third party distributors as well as hours incurred by our Clinical Team for providing monitoring services that are billed to our customers. Our customers consist of national and regional health plans, government-funded benefit programs, healthcare provider organizations, and individuals.\nGrant Income\nGrant income. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received distributions of the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund targeted to offset lost revenue and expenditures incurred in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating Expenses\nService expense. Service Expense for our NEMT segment includes purchased transportation, operational payroll and other operational related costs. Purchased transportation includes the amounts we pay to third-party service providers and is typically dependent upon service volume. Operational payroll predominately includes our contact center operations, customer advocacy and transportation network team. Other operating expenses primarily include operational overhead costs, and operating facilities and related charges. Service expense for our Personal Care segment includes payroll and other operational related costs for our caregivers to provide in-home care. Service expense for our RPM segment primarily consists of salaries of employees in our contact centers, connectivity costs and occupancy costs.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense for all segments consists principally of salaries for administrative employees that indirectly support the operations, occupancy costs, marketing expenditures, insurance, and professional fees.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation within this caption includes infrastructure items such as computer hardware and software, office equipment, monitoring and vitals equipment, buildings, and leasehold improvements.\nAmortization expense is generated primarily from amortization of our intangible assets, including payor networks, trade names, developed technology, a non-compete agreement, an assembled workforce, and a New York LHCSA permit.\nOther Expenses (Income)\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense consists principally of interest payments on the Company's borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2021 under the Credit Facility and Senior Unsecured Notes, and amortization of deferred financing fees. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section below for further discussion of these borrowings.\nEquity in net income (loss) of investee. Equity in earnings of equity method investee consists of our proportionate share of equity earnings or losses from our Matrix equity investment.\nIncome tax expense (benefit). The Company is subject to federal taxation in the United States and state taxation in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.\nResults of Operations\nDiscontinued operations. During the periods presented, we completed the following disposition transactions, which resulted in the presentation of the related operations as Discontinued Operations.\n\u2022On November 1, 2015, we completed the sale of our former Human Services segment and since the completion of the sale, we have recorded additional expenses related to legal proceedings for an indemnified legal matter.\n\u2022On December 21, 2018, we completed the sale of substantially all of the operating subsidiaries of our former WD Services segment to APM and APM UK Holdings Limited, an affiliate of APM, except for the segment's employment services operations in Saudi Arabia. Our contractual counterparties in Saudi Arabia, including an entity owned by the Saudi Arabian government, assumed these operations beginning January 1, 2019. Wind down activities of our Saudi Arabian entity are included in our discontinued operations. Additionally, on June 11, 2018, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement to sell Ingeus France for a de minimis amount. The sale was effective on July 17, 2018.\nSee Note 22, Discontinued Operations, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.\nSegment reporting. Our segments reflect the manner in which our operations are organized and reviewed by management.\nWe operate in four reportable business segments: NEMT, Personal Care, RPM and the Matrix Investment. Prior to November 17, 2020, our primary operating segment was NEMT, which provides non-emergency medical transportation services. Our Personal Care segment is composed of the operations from two acquisitions: Simplura on November 18, 2020, which operates in the non-medical personal care service industry; and Care Finders on September 14, 2021, a personal care service provider with operations concentrated in the Northeast, with a scaled presence in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut. On September 22, 2021, we acquired VRI, resulting in the establishment of our RPM segment. VRI is a provider of remote patient monitoring solutions. Our investment in Matrix is also a reportable segment referred to as the Matrix Investment\u201d. Segment results are based on how our chief operating decision maker manages our business, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance. The operating results of our NEMT, Personal Care and RPM segments include revenue and expenses incurred by the segment, and the operating results of our NEMT segment also include our activities related to executive, accounting, finance, internal audit, tax, legal and certain strategic and corporate development functions for each segment. See Note 4, Segments, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on our segments.\nYear ended December 31, 2021 compared to year ended December 31, 2020\nThe following table sets forth results of operations and the percentage of consolidated total revenues represented by items in our consolidated statements of operations for 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage\nof Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage\nof Revenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenue, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,996,892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,368,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grant income </td> <td>5,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service expense </td> <td>1,584,298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,078,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.8% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense </td> <td>271,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>140,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>56,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>26,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>1,912,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,245,517 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>89,771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>123,158 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating expense: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net </td> <td>49,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>17,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity method investment\n</td> <td>40,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>105,559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td>8,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4% </td> <td> </td> <td>22,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net (income) loss of investee, net of tax </td> <td>38,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,411) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations </td> <td>(6,289) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3)% </td> <td> </td> <td>89,614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax </td> <td>(296) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td>(778) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,585) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nService revenue, net. Consolidated service revenue, net, for 2021 increased $628.2 million, or 45.9%, compared to 2020. Service revenue, net, for our NEMT segment increased by $169.0 million, primarily due to higher trip volume when compared to 2020, as trip volume was depressed in the prior year due to the impact of COVID-19. Service revenue, net, further increased incrementally by $441.6 million for our Personal Care segment due to the inclusion of the entire year of operating results of Simplura as compared to the small portion of operating results recognized in 2020 due to the acquisition in November 2020, as well as the inclusion of the operating results of Care Finders acquired in September 2021. The acquisition of VRI contributed $17.6 million to the service revenue, net. See our results of operations, segments, for further discussion.\nGrant income. Grant income for 2021 of $5.4 million is related to the receipt of payments from the COVID-19 Provider Relief Fund which was received for our Personal Care segment and is available to eligible providers who diagnose, test, or care for individuals with possible or actual cases of COVID-19, and have health care related expenses and lost revenues attributable to COVID-19.\nService expense.

Payroll and related costs increased further by $357.0 million, primarily related to incremental costs of $344.9 million in the Personal Care segment due to the acquisitions of Simplura and Care Finders.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense for 2021 increased $130.7 million, or 93.0%, compared to 2020, related to an increase of $62.1 million in our NEMT segment, primarily related to transaction costs for the acquisitions of Care Finders and VRI, as well as value enhancement projects. The increase was further attributable to $62.8 million of incremental costs related to the addition of the Personal Care segment. See our results of operations, segments, for further discussion.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization for 2021 increased $30.8 million, or 117.7%, compared to 2020 primarily as a result of intangible assets brought on under the WellRyde acquisition in the second quarter of 2021 and under the Care Finders and VRI acquisitions in the third quarter of 2021. Additionally, this figure includes depreciation and amortization for Simplura for the entire year as compared to the prior year when Simplura was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2020. See Note 3, Acquisitions.\nInterest expense, net. Consolidated interest expense for 2021 increased $31.5 million, or 178.9%, compared to 2020. Interest expense increased as a result of the activity related to the $500.0 million Senior Notes due 2025 and the $500.0 million Senior Notes due 2029, that were issued on November 4, 2020 and August 24, 2021, respectively. We incurred $31.7 million and $9.1 million of interest expense related to the Senior Notes due 2025 and the Senior Notes due 2029 during the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively.\nEquity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax. Our equity in net income (loss) of investee for 2021 and 2020 represents our proportional share of the results of Matrix, of which we own 43.6%. See further discussion at the Matrix segment in our results of operations - segments section.\nProvision for income taxes. Our effective tax rates from continuing operations for 2021 and 2020 were a provision of 21.5% and 21.2%, respectively. The 2021 effective tax rate was slightly higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to state income taxes and certain non-deductible expenses, offset by tax credits and stock-based compensation windfalls. For 2020, the effective tax rate was slightly higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to state income taxes and certain non-deductible expenses offset by the favorable impact of the CARES Act on the Company's 2018 U.S. net operating losses (NOLs).\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax. Loss from discontinued operations includes the activity related to our former WD Services segment. See Note 22, Discontinued Operations, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nFor a comparison of our results of operations see Part II, Item 7.

Service revenue, net, increased by $169.0 million and 12.9%, from 2020 to 2021. This increase is primarily attributable to $59.0 million of revenue related to higher membership and increased trip volume in addition to $110.0 million of revenue related to contracts from the NMT acquisition that took place in the second quarter of 2020. Trip volume increased for the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to 2020, as trip volume was depressed in the prior year due to the impact of COVID-19. While a majority of our contacts are capitated and we receive monthly payments on a per member/fixed basis in return for full or partial risk of transportation volumes, we have certain contracts that limit profit to within a certain corridor and once we reach the maximum profit level we discontinue recognizing revenue and instead build a liability to return back to the customer upon reconciliation at a later date. Other contracts that are structured as fee-for-service also experienced positive impacts to revenue due to higher trip volumes.\nService expense. Service expense for our NEMT segment primarily consists of transportation costs paid to third party service providers, salaries of employees within our contact centers and operations centers, and occupancy costs. Service expense increased by $149.9 million and 14.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily related to higher purchased services of $145.8 million related to an increase in transportation costs and associated payroll costs in our contact centers due to higher trip volume in the current year.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries for administrative employees that indirectly support the operations, occupancy costs, marketing expenditures, insurance, and professional fees. General and administrative expense increased by $62.1 million and 46.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of $26.3 million related to personnel expense, $21.4 million related to the acquisitions of WellRyde, Care Finders and VRI, $7.6 million in legal expense, and $2.5 million related to occupancy expense.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $4.5 million and 18.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of a full year of amortization on the NMT intangibles in 2021, as compared to only five months of amortization in 2020, and the addition of acquired intangibles during 2021 related to the acquisition of WellRyde.\nPersonal Care Segment\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Segment Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Segment Revenue </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenue, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>495,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grant income </td> <td>5,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service expense </td> <td>392,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>42,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.8% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense </td> <td>70,163 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>7,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.6% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>23,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Personal Care segment was established in November 2020 with the acquisition of Simplura and expanded in September 2021 with the acquisition of Care Finders. Our personal care segment's services include placements of non-medical personal care assistants and home health aides and nurses primarily to Medicaid patient populations in need of care monitoring and assistance performing daily living activities in the home setting, including senior citizens and disabled adults. The year over year fluctuations are not comparable, as there was only two months of activity in 2020 and a full year in 2021.\nService revenue, net. Personal care service contracts are generally structured as fee-for-service contracts, with revenue being driven by hours worked by the personal care providers. Service revenue, net, from MCO contracts accounted for 60.3% of service revenue, net, for the year ended December 31, 2021, while U.S. State Medicaid program contracts accounted for 33.0% of service revenue, net for the year ended December 31, 2021. The remainder of the Personal Care segment revenue is derived from private pay and other contracts.\nGrant Income. In the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received distributions of the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund of approximately $5.4 million targeted to offset lost revenue and unreimbursed expenditures incurred in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nService expense. Service expense for our personal care segment primarily consists of salaries for the employees providing the personal care services and it typically trends with the number of hours worked. For the year ended December 31, 2021, service expense for the Personal Care segment includes $43.2 million related to the Care Finders acquisition, with the remainder related to Simplura.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries for administrative employees that indirectly support the operations, occupancy costs, marketing expenditures, insurance, and professional fees. General and administrative expense for the Personal Care segment includes $12.8 million related to the Care Finders acquisition, with the remainder being related to Simplura.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of amortization expense on the intangible assets brought on under the Simplura acquisition of $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to only a portion of the year in 2020.\nRPM Segment\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Segment Revenue </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenue, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service expense </td> <td>5,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.8% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense </td> <td>5,771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.8% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>4,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.7% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,060 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.7% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Remote Patient Monitoring segment was established in September 2021 with the acquisition of VRI. VRI is a provider of remote patient monitoring solutions and manages a comprehensive suite of services, including personal emergency response systems, vitals monitoring and data-driven patient engagement solutions.\nService revenue, net. RPM contracts are generally structured as a fee per enrolled member per month, and therefore revenue is generally driven by number of enrolled members. Service revenue, net, from MCO contracts accounted for 53.7% of service revenue, net, for the year ended December 31, 2021, while U.S. State Medicaid program contracts accounted for 28.4% of service revenue, net for the year ended December 31, 2021. The remainder of the RPM segment revenue is derived from private pay and other contracts.\nService expense. Service expense for our RPM segment primarily consists of salaries for the employees providing the remote monitoring services and it typically trends with the number of hours worked.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries for administrative employees that indirectly support the operations, occupancy costs, marketing expenditures, insurance, and professional fees.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of amortization expense on the intangible assets brought on during the acquisition as well as depreciation on the fixed assets acquired.\nMatrix Segment\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(38,250) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,411 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity investment </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,069 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>137,466 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe company holds a 43.6% minority interest in CCHN Group Holdings, Inc., and its subsidiaries, which operates under the Matrix Medical Network brand, which we refer to as Matrix\u201d. Matrix maintains a national network of community-based clinicians who deliver in-home and on-site services, and a fleet of mobile health clinics that provide community-based care with advanced diagnostic capabilities and enhanced care options.\nEquity in net income (loss) of investee changed from income of $6.4 million for the year ended 2020 to a loss of $38.3 million for the year ended 2021. Revenue over this period decreased by $16.4 million, operating expenses increased by $21.7 million and a $111.4 million impairment was taken in 2021. The decrease in revenue is due to the decline in COVID-19 testing and screening in the Clinical Solutions business, which is offset by an increase in year over year volume by 122 thousand visits in the Clinical Care business. Operating expenses increased due to an increase in visits, investments in Clinical Solutions, Lab, and Clinical Trials, and consulting fees to move the IT platform to the cloud, re-engineer Clinical Care, and stand up Clinical Solutions infrastructure.\nMatrix reported that its net loss for 2021 was negatively impacted by its Clinical Solutions business, which had a decrease in revenue due to a faster than expected vaccination rollout and winding down of COVID testing, which was offset by the launch of its clinical trials business in the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, Matrix reported increased revenue and income related to a clinical solutions product offering following the October 2020 acquisition of Biocerna LLC, a diagnostic company that, among other tests, provides rapid COVID-19 test kits.\nSeasonality\nOur NEMT segment's operating income and cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business, principally due to lower transportation demand during the winter season and higher demand during the summer season.\nOur Personal Care segment's operating income and cash flows also normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in the business, principally due to somewhat lower demand for in-home services from caregivers during the summer and periods with major holidays, as patients may spend more time with family and less time alone needing outside care during those periods.\nOur RPM segment's operating income and cash flows do not normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in the business.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nShort-term capital requirements consist primarily of recurring operating expenses, new revenue contract start-up costs and costs associated with our strategic initiatives. We expect to meet our cash requirements through available cash on hand, cash generated from operations, net of capital expenditures, and borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities entered into from time to time.\nCash flow from operating activities was $186.8 million in 2021. Our balance of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $133.4 million and $183.4 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We had restricted cash of $0.3 million and $0.1 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Restricted cash amounts are not included in our balance of cash and cash equivalents in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, although they are included in the cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balance on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.\nWe may, from time to time, access capital markets to raise equity or debt financing for various business reasons, including acquisitions and possible refinancing activity. We may also raise debt financing to fund future repurchases of our common stock and possible debt refinancing activity. The timing, term, size, and pricing of any such financing will depend on investor interest and market conditions, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing on terms acceptable to us at the time or at all.\n2021 cash flows compared to 2020\nOperating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $186.8 million for 2021 compared to $348.4 million in 2020. The decrease of $161.6 million was primarily a result of a $95.4 million decrease in net income, primarily attributable to the loss in our Matrix investment of $38.3 million net of tax, along with a $56.8 million decrease in cash used for accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a $67.3 million decrease in cash related to accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in cash of $31.0 million related to higher accrued transportation costs and an increase in cash of $27.6 million related to higher amortization expense.\nInvesting activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $685.6 million in 2021 compared to $635.0 million in 2020. The change in cash used in investing was driven by increased cash used for acquisitions of $41.4 million, primarily attributable to net cash outflows of $12.5 million related to the asset purchase of WellRyde in May 2021, $333.4 million related to the acquisition of Care Finders in September 2021, and $314.6 million related to the acquisition of VRI in September 2021, which were in excess of cash outflows for our acquisitions of Simplura and NMT that occurred in 2020.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $448.9 million in 2021 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $408.3 million in 2020. The increase of $40.6 million in 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase of $88.8 million of cash that was not used for redemptions of preferred stock, partially offset by a decrease of $29.8 million of cash used in the repurchase of company common stock in 2021.\nWe also had increased borrowings on our Credit Facility throughout 2021 that allowed us the temporary liquidity needed during the year to execute our acquisitions and stock buyback program. As of December 31, 2021 we had no borrowings on our Credit Facility or our New Credit Facility.\n2020 cash flows compared to 2019\nFor a comparison of our cash flows for the 2020 period to the 2019 period, see Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021.\nObligations and commitments\nSenior Unsecured Notes. On November 4, 2020, the Company issued $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior unsecured notes due on November 15, 2025 (the Senior Notes due 2025\u201d). Subsequently, on August 24, 2021, the Company issued an additional $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior unsecured notes due on October 1, 2029 (the Senior Notes due 2029\u201dand, together with the Senior Notes due 2025, the Notes\u201d). The Senior Notes due 2025 and the Senior Notes due 2029 were issued pursuant to two indentures, dated November 4, 2020 and August 24, 2021, respectively, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The proceeds from the Senior Notes due 2025 were used to fund a portion of the Company's acquisition of Simplura and the proceeds from the Senior Notes due 2029 were used to fund a portion of the Company's acquisition of VRI.\nThe Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company's future subordinated indebtedness, rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's existing senior indebtedness, are effectively subordinated to any of the Company's existing and future secured indebtedness, including indebtedness under the New Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and are structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future liabilities (including trade payables) of each of the Company's non-guarantor subsidiaries.\nThe Company will pay interest on the Notes at their applicable annual rates until maturity. Interest on the Senior Notes due 2025 is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. Interest on the Senior Notes due 2029 is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, with the first interest payment date being April 1, 2022. Principal payments are not required until the maturity date on November 15, 2025 and October 1, 2029 when 100% of the outstanding principal will be required to be repaid on the Senior Notes due 2025 and the Senior Notes due 2029, respectively.\nCredit Facility. At December 31, 2021, the Company was a party to the amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement, dated as of August 2, 2013 (as amended, the Credit Agreement\u201d), with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and letter of credit issuer, and the other lenders party thereto. Among the other amendments to the Credit Agreement since its execution in 2013, on May 6, 2020, the Company amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, extend the then stated maturity date to August 1, 2021, expand the amount available under the related revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) from $200.0 million to $225.0 million, and increased the sub-facility for letters of credit from $25.0 million to $40.0 million.\nSubsequently, on October 16, 2020, the Company further amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, permit the incurrence of additional debt to finance the acquisition of Simplura, permit borrowing under the Credit Facility to partially fund the Simplura Acquisition with limited conditions to such borrowing, increase the top interest rate margin that may have applied to loans thereunder, revise the permitted ratio of EBITDA to indebtedness, and extend the maturity date to August 2, 2023. See Note 3, Acquisitions, for further information on the Simplura acquisition. Thereafter, on September 13, 2021, the Company again amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, permit the incurrence of additional debt to finance the acquisition of VRI and revise certain financial covenants to permit the consummation of the VRI acquisition. See Note 3, Acquisitions, for further information on the VRI acquisition.\nFollowing the amendment associated with the VRI acquisition, interest on the outstanding principal amount of loans under the Credit Facility accrued, at the Company's election, at a per annum rate equal to the greater of either LIBOR or 1.00%, plus an applicable margin, or the Base Rate as defined in the Credit Agreement plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin ranged from 2.25% to 3.50% in the case of LIBOR loans and 1.25% to 2.50% in the case of the Base Rate loans, in each case, based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement that governed the Credit Facility. The commitment fee and letter of credit fee ranged from 0.35% to 0.50% and 2.25% to 3.50%, respectively, in each case based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement that governed the Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and it was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2021.\nNew Credit Facility. On February 3, 2022, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and an issuing bank, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as an issuing bank, Truist Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-syndication agents, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Bank of America, N.A., Regions Bank, Bank of Montreal and Capital One, National Association, as co-documentation agents, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Truist Securities, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers, and the other lenders party thereto. The New Credit Agreement provides the Company with a senior secured revolving credit facility (the New Credit Facility\u201d) in an aggregate principal amount of $325.0 million. There is an option to increase the amount of the New Credit Facility or obtain incremental term loans by an aggregate amount of up to $175.0 million, plus an unlimited amount so long as the pro forma secured net leverage ratio does not exceed 3.50:1.00, as described below. The New Credit Facility includes sublimits for swingline loans, letters of credit and alternative currency loans in amounts of up to $25.0 million, $60.0 million and $75.0 million, respectively. The Company did not draw any amount of the New Credit Facility at closing of the New Credit Agreement. At closing of the New Credit Agreement, the Company had $22.8 million of outstanding letters of credit under the New Credit Facility. The proceeds of the New Credit Facility may be used (i) to finance working capital needs of the Company and its subsidiaries and (ii) for general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries (including to finance capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions and investments). The New Credit Facility replaces the Credit Facility under the Credit Agreement, which was terminated concurrently with the Company's entry into the New Credit Agreement.\nUnder the New Credit Facility the Company has an option to request an increase in the amount of the New Credit Facility or obtain incremental term loans from time to time (on substantially the same terms as apply to the existing facilities) by an aggregate amount of up to $175.0 million, plus an unlimited amount so long as the pro forma secured net leverage ratio does not exceed 3.50:1.00, with either additional commitments from lenders under the New Credit Agreement at such time or new commitments from financial institutions approved by the Company and the administrative agent (which approval is not to be unreasonably withheld), so long as, at the time of any such increase, no default or event of default exists, the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the New Credit Agreement are true and correct in all material respects and the Company is in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants in the New Credit Agreement. The Company may not be able to access additional funds under this increase option as no lender is obligated to participate in any such increase under the New Credit Facility.\nThe New Credit Facility matures on February 3, 2027. The Company may prepay the New Credit Facility in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to reimbursement of the lenders' breakage and redeployment costs in connection with prepayments of Term Benchmark loans or RFR loans, each as defined in the New Credit Agreement. The unutilized portion of the commitments under the New Credit Facility may be irrevocably reduced or terminated by the Company at any time without penalty.\nInterest on the outstanding principal amount of the loans accrues at a per annum rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate or the Adjusted Daily Simple SONIA Rate, as applicable and each as defined in the New Credit Agreement, in each case, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from 1.75% to 3.50% in the case of Term Benchmark loans or RFR loans, each as defined in the Credit Agreement, and 0.75% to 2.50% in the case of the Alternate Base Rate loans, in each case, based on the Company's total net leverage ratio as defined in the New Credit Agreement. Interest on the loans is payable quarterly in arrears in the case of Alternate Base Rate loans, on the last day of the relevant interest period in the case of Term Benchmark loan, and monthly in arrears in the case of RFR loans. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee based on a percentage of the unused portion of the revolving credit facility and quarterly letter of credit fees based on a percentage of the maximum amount available to be drawn under each outstanding letter of credit. The commitment fee and letter of credit fee ranges from 0.30% to 0.50% and 1.75% to 3.50%, respectively, in each case, based on the Company's total net leverage ratio.\nThe New Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The negative covenants include restrictions on the Company's ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens, make investments, give guarantees, pay dividends, sell assets and merge and consolidate. The Company is subject to financial covenants, including total net leverage and interest coverage covenants.\nThe Company's obligations under the New Credit Facility are guaranteed by all of the Company's present and future material domestic subsidiaries, excluding certain material domestic subsidiaries that are excluded from being guarantors pursuant to the terms of the New Credit Agreement. The Company's obligations under, and each guarantor's obligations under its guaranty of, the New Credit Facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the Company's or such guarantor's respective assets. If an event of default occurs, the required lenders may cause the administrative agent to declare all unpaid principal and any accrued and unpaid interest and all fees and expenses under the New Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable. All amounts outstanding under the New Credit Facility will automatically become due and payable upon the commencement of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. The New Credit Agreement also contains a cross default to any of the Company's indebtedness having a principal amount in excess of $40 million.\nPreferred Stock. On June 8, 2020, the Company entered into a Preferred Stock Conversion Agreement (the \"Conversion Agreement\") with the Coliseum Stockholders. Pursuant to the Conversion Agreement, the Company purchased 369,120 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, in exchange for $209.88 in cash per share of Series A Preferred Stock, plus a cash amount equal to accrued but unpaid dividends on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock through the day prior to June 11, 2020. Further, the Coliseum Stockholders converted 369,120 shares of Series A Preferred Stock into 925,567 shares of common stock, a cash payment equal to accrued but unpaid dividends on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock through June 11, 2020, and a cash payment of $8.82 per share of Series A Preferred Stock. The amount of accrued dividends paid pursuant to the Conversion Agreement was equal to $0.8 million.\nFurther, on September 3, 2020, the Company elected to effect the conversion (the Conversion\u201d) of all of the outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. In accordance with the Conversion Agreement, as amended, immediately prior to the Conversion, the Company repurchased 27,509 shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Coliseum Shareholders for a cash amount equal to $209.88 per share of Series A Preferred Stock and a cash amount equal to accrued but unpaid dividends on such shares through the day prior to the Conversion.\nCash dividends on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were payable quarterly in arrears to the Preferred Shareholders on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year, and, if declared, began to accrue on the first day of the applicable dividend period. The Company had the option to pay dividends in kind, but never exercised such option while the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were outstanding. Convertible preferred stock dividends earned by the Coliseum Stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2020 were $2.0 million, including accrued dividends paid pursuant to the Conversion Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2021, no convertible preferred stock dividends were issued.\nInsurance Programs\nWith respect to the Company's historical wholly-owned captive insurance company subsidiary, Social Services Providers Captive Insurance Company, or SPCIC, the operations with respect to which have been discontinued since 2017, the Company utilizes a report prepared by an independent actuary to estimate the gross expected losses related to historical automobile, general and professional and workers' compensation liability reinsurance policies, including the estimated losses in excess of SPCIC's insurance limits, which would be reimbursed to SPCIC to the extent such losses were incurred. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had reserves of $8.3 million and $6.3 million, respectively, for the automobile, general and professional liability and workers' compensation reinsurance policies. The gross reserve as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 of $22.3 million and $15.1 million, respectively, is classified as other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The estimated amount to be reimbursed to the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $14.0 million and $8.8 million, respectively, and is classified as other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The increase in these amounts from 2020 to 2021 is largely attributable to the coverage of the Simplura business under our insurance programs.\nFurther, we had restricted cash of $0.3 million and $0.1 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, which was primarily restricted to secure the reinsured claims losses under the historical automobile, general and professional liability and workers' compensation reinsurance programs.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity measures our ability to meet current and future cash flow needs on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity position to meet our daily cash flow needs, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders. Our liquidity position is supported by management of liquid assets and liabilities and access to alternative sources of funds. Liquid assets include cash of $133.1 million and accounts receivable and other receivables of $237.9 million. Liquid liabilities totaled $638.7 million at year end as detailed in the table below. Other sources of liquidity include our New Credit Facility of $325.0 million.\nIn the ordinary course of business we have entered into contractual obligations and have made other commitments to make future payments. Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily to fund on-going operations. These liquidity requirements are met primarily through cash flow from operations of $186.8 million, debt financing, and our New Credit Facility of $325.0 million. For additional information regarding our operating, investing and financing cash flows, see Consolidated Financial Statements-Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows,\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nThe Company has cash requirements of $638.7 million due in one year or less in addition to $1,398.9 million due in more than one year as of December 31, 2021. The following is a summary of our future cash requirements for the next twelve months and the period extending beyond twelve months as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At December 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than </td> <td> </td> <td>Greater than </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 Year </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Unsecured Notes (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,000,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,000,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>306,681 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>252,306 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guarantees (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>47,066 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,879 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>53,376 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,120 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>22,779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contracts payable (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>281,586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>281,586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation costs (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>103,294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103,294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other current cash obligations (6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>128,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred tax liabilities (7)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>94,611 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94,611 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,037,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>638,730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,398,916 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further detail of our Senior Unsecured Notes and the timing of expected future payments.

There are statutory, regulatory, and debt covenant limitations that affect our ability to access the capital market for funds. Management believes that such limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing short-term cash obligations. Management continuously monitors our liquidity position and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Our management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources, or operations. In addition, our management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity, which if implemented, would have a material adverse effect on us.\nStock repurchase programs\nOn August 6, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could repurchase up to $100.0 million in aggregate value of the Company's Common Stock, subject to the consent of the holders of a majority of the Company's Series A convertible preferred stock, through December 31, 2019, at which time it expired. A total of 105,421 shares were repurchased under this program for approximately $6.0 million, during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOn March 11, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company could repurchase up to $75.0 million in aggregate value of the Company's Common Stock, subject to the consent of the holders\nof a majority of the Company's Series A convertible preferred stock, through December 31, 2020. A total of 195,677 shares were repurchased under this program for approximately $10.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn March 8, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $75.0 million in aggregate value of the Company's Common Stock through December 31, 2021, unless terminated earlier. A total of 276,268 shares were repurchased under the program for $40.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements, as discussed in Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nOverview of Our Business\nPlease refer to Item 1. Business\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our services and corporate strategy.\nModivCare Inc. (\"ModivCare\" or the \"Company\") is a technology-enabled healthcare services company that provides a suite of integrated supportive care solutions for public and private payors and their patients. Its value-based solutions address the social determinants of health, or SDoH, enable greater access to care, reduce costs, and improve outcomes. ModivCare is a provider of non-emergency medical transportation, or NEMT, personal care, and remote patient monitoring, or RPM, solutions. The technology-enabled operating model includes NEMT core competencies in risk underwriting, contact center management, network credentialing, claims management and non-emergency medical transportation management. Additionally, its personal care services include placements of non-medical personal care assistants, home health aides and nurses primarily to Medicaid patient populations in need of care monitoring and assistance performing daily living activities in the home setting, including senior citizens and disabled adults. ModivCare's remote patient monitoring services include personal emergency response systems, vitals monitoring and data-driven patient engagement solutions. ModivCare is further expanding its offerings to include meal delivery and working with communities to provide food-insecure individuals delivery of meals.\nModivCare's solutions help health plans manage risks, close care gaps, reduce costs, and connect members to care. Through the combination of its historical NEMT business, its in-home personal care business that consists of Simplura Health Group and Care Finders Total Care LLC, and its recent addition of the remote patient monitoring business through its acquisition of VRI Intermediate Holdings, LLC, ModivCare has united four complementary healthcare businesses that serve similar, highly vulnerable patient populations.\nModivCare also holds a 43.6% minority interest in CCHN Group Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, which operates under the Matrix Medical Network brand and which we refer to as Matrix\u201d. Matrix maintains a national network of community-based clinicians who deliver in-home and on-site services, and a fleet of mobile health clinics that provide community-based care with advanced diagnostic capabilities and enhanced care options. Matrix's clinical care business (\"Clinical Care\") provides risk adjustment solutions that improve health outcomes for individuals and financial performance for health plans. Matrix's clinical solutions business (\"Clinical Solutions\") provides employee health and wellness services focused on improving employee health with worksite certification solutions that reinforce business resilience and safe return-to-work outcomes. Its Clinical Solutions offerings also provide clinical trial services which support the delivery of safe and effective decentralized clinical trial operations to patients and eligible volunteers. Matrix also provides lab services, including services related to COVID-19 such as screening, testing, and vaccinations.\nBusiness Outlook and Trends\nOur performance is affected by a number of trends that drive the demand for our services. In particular, the markets in which we operate are exposed to various trends, such as healthcare industry and demographic dynamics. Over the long term, we believe there are numerous factors that could affect growth within the industries in which we operate, including:\n\u2022an aging population, which is expected to increase demand for healthcare services and transportation and, accordingly, in-home personal care services;\n\u2022increasing prevalence of chronic illnesses that require active and ongoing monitoring of health data which can be accomplished at a lower cost and result in better health outcomes through remote patient monitoring services;\n\u2022a movement towards value-based care versus fee-for-service and cost plus care and budget pressure on governments, both of which may increase the use of private corporations to provide necessary and innovative services;\n\u2022increasing demand for in-home care provision, driven by cost pressures on traditional reimbursement models and technological advances enabling remote engagement, including remote monitoring and similar internet-based health related services;\n\u2022technological advancements, which may be utilized by us to improve services and lower costs, but may also be utilized by others, which may increase industry competitiveness; and\n\u2022MCO, Medicaid and Medicare plans increasingly are covering NEMT services for a variety of reasons, including increased access to care, improved patient compliance with treatment plans, social trends, and to promote SDoH, and this trend may be accelerated or reinforced by The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (\"H.R.133\"), a component of which mandates that state Medicaid programs ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries have necessary transportation to and from health care providers.\nSince March 2020 and primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have observed a material reduction in trip volume in our NEMT segment as a result of state imposed public health orders, many of which reduced medical services to life-sustaining programs only (for example, dialysis and chemotherapy). This reduction in trip volume has had a negative financial impact on our transportation providers and may impact the availability of transportation providers in the future given the heightened sanitation requirements imposed on drivers and depressed volume.\nOur Personal Care segment business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience a material reduction in volume of service hours and visits. Volume has been reduced as members put services on hold due to infection concerns, and/or because they had the alternative of receiving care from family members and other caregivers working remotely or furloughed from their jobs. Cases have also been lost due to patient deaths, and new case referrals slowed as referral sources faced disruption from the various restrictions and public health orders. Our personal care service volumes are not expected to recover to pre-pandemic levels until the vaccination status of members in the markets where we provide services is at a higher rate where individuals feel comfortable receiving care and any current or future COVID-19 variants do not jeopardize the safety of vaccinated members. These depressed volumes will continue to result in lower than expected revenue, at least in the near term, in the Personal Care segment.\nOur RPM segment has not experienced a direct material impact to operations or financial activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While this segment of the business has proven resilient given the increase in demand for remote healthcare services in a highly contagious infection environment, potential risks could arise that could have a material impact on the financial results of the segment. Specifically, given the strain on the healthcare professionals that serve the healthcare community, we could experience shortages in qualified medical professionals that support our remote care monitoring business.\nFurthermore, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is continuously evolving, and the continuation of the pandemic, any additional resurgence, or COVID-19 variants could continue to change trends in the market.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. We base our estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThere are certain critical estimates that require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:\n\u2022it requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made; and\n\u2022changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAccrued Transportation Costs\nDescription. We generally pay our transportation providers for completed trips based on documentation submitted after services have been provided. The transportation service is initiated at the time a member submits a request for transportation services from our providers. At this time, we calculate an estimated transportation cost for each trip based on historical experience and contractual terms. This portion of the accrued transportation cost is based on requests for services we have received and the amount we expect to be billed by our transportation providers. All completed trips (both unbilled and billed) for which we have not yet issued payment reconcile to our total accrued transportation cost, however the critical\naccounting estimate that requires significant judgment is the portion of the accrual that is estimated at initiation of the member request.\nJudgments and Uncertainties. The transportation cost accrual requires significant judgment as it is calculated using contractual rates and mileage estimates, as well as an estimated rate for unknown cancellations given that members may have requested transportation without yet notifying the Company of cancellation. Based upon historical trip experience and contractual terms, we estimate the amount of transportation cost incurred for invoices which have not yet been submitted. The estimates are routinely monitored and compared to actual invoiced costs. Actual cost could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to facts and circumstances that differ from historical trends.\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change. The estimates for the transportation accrual are developed using assumptions based on the best information available to the Company at the time, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result, actual results may differ significantly from estimates. In determining our estimate each period, we use data around historical trip experience, current contractual rates, and mileage estimates and use a third party consultant to assist in development of the expected accrual. Our December 31, 2021 estimated portion of the accrued transportation costs was $3.5 million greater than our estimated portion in 2020 and $2.2 million less than our estimated portion in 2019. The decrease from 2019 to 2021 was a result of the overall decrease in trip volume during the COVID 19 pandemic. The assumptions used in the estimate inputs include estimated trip costs and estimated trip volume. If we were to assume that our estimate of future transportation costs was changed to the upper end or lower end of the range we developed in the course of formulating our estimate, the estimate for future transportation costs as of December 31, 2021 would range from $19.6 million to $23.9 million.\nBusiness Combinations\nDescription. We account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions at the date of acquisition as we allocate the value of the consideration assigned to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any excess purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Additionally, the economic lives assigned to the identifiable intangible assets requires significant judgments from management.\nJudgments and Uncertainties. When determining the fair value of the purchase price to be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, valuation techniques such as the income, cost, or market approach are used and third-party valuation experts are often consulted to assist in the calculation of fair value. Measurement of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on available historical information and expectations and assumptions about future performance. Critical assumptions that require estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimates and assumptions used in determining net future cash flows and the selection of respective discount rates.\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change. Estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result, actual results may differ significantly from estimates.\nOn November 18, 2020, the Company acquired Simplura for $569.8 million. The significant intangible assets identified include the payor network and the trade name. The payor network was determined to have a fair value of $221.0 million and was calculated using the multi-period excess earnings method which includes assumptions on the customer attrition rate, revenue growth rates, and discount rate. The trade name was determined to have a fair value of $43.0 million and was calculated using the relief-from-royalty method which includes assumptions on the revenue projections, royalty rates, and discount rates. Management used a third-party valuation specialist to assist in the allocation of fair value and believes the estimates applied are based upon reasonable assumptions, but understands that estimates of significant assumptions could change resulting in potential impairment losses in the future.\nOn September 14, 2021, the Company acquired Care Finders for $344.8 million. The significant intangible asset identified was the payor network. The payor network was determined to have a fair value of $97.2 million and was calculated using the multi-period excess earnings method which includes assumptions on customer attrition rate, revenue growth rates, and discount rate. Management used a third-party valuation specialist to assist in the allocation of fair value and believes the estimates applied are based upon reasonable assumptions, but understands that estimates of significant assumptions could change resulting in potential impairment losses in the future.\nOn September 22, 2021, the Company acquired VRI for $317.5 million. The significant intangible asset identified was the payor network. The payor network was determined to have a fair value of $72.2 million and was calculated using the multi-period excess earnings method which includes assumptions on customer attrition rate, revenue growth rates, and discount rate. Management used a third-party valuation specialist to assist in the allocation of fair value and believes the estimates applied are\nbased upon reasonable assumptions, but understands that estimates around significant assumptions could change resulting in potential impairment losses in the future.\nRecoverability of Goodwill\nDescription. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, we review goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to: (1) the loss or modification of significant contracts, (2) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (3) unanticipated competition, (4) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, or (5) a significant decline in our stock price. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1. Goodwill is allocated across the Company's reporting units: NEMT, Simplura, Care Finders, and VRI. We first perform qualitative assessments for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment suggests that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value amount, we then perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value is determined to exceed the estimated fair value, the asset is considered impaired.\nJudgments and Uncertainties. When performing a quantitative assessment to estimate the fair value of the Company's goodwill, the Company applies the discounted cash flow method which includes assumptions on the projected future cash flows, earnings, discount rates, working capital adjustments, long-term growth rates, and others.\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change. The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill may result in a different value recorded, which could result in an impairment charge that has the potential to have a material impact to the consolidated statement of operations. As of the date of our annual goodwill analysis, no goodwill impairment charges were recorded.\nIncome Taxes\nDescription. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, we record income tax expense for the amount of taxes payable or refundable in the current period and deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax reporting purposes. We determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, and we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in our current tax returns.\nJudgments and Uncertainties. Significant assumptions, judgments, and estimates are made by management when determining the income tax provision (benefit) for the current year, the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recorded, and the necessary valuation allowance to be recorded against the deferred tax asset. These judgements include interpretations of income tax regulations, estimates of future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and the likelihood of recovery of deferred tax assets or that a tax position will be sustained upon audit.\nWe consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes. We may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates.\nWe record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in our current tax returns. The determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position, taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position, based on technical merits, will be sustained upon examination. For those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not the position will be sustained, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. The difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability. While the Company believes all of its tax positions are fully supportable, the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded.\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change. If there are any changes in the underlying estimates and assumptions to calculate the current period income tax provision or deferred tax assets and liabilities, or if the settlement of tax issues from a current period audit results in a tax position that is no longer supported, the financial statements could be materially impacted. During the period ended December 31, 2021, the Company had recorded $0.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, in other long-term liabilities.\nResults of Operations\nThe following results of operations include the accounts of ModivCare and our subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The results of Care Finders Total Care and VRI Intermediate Holdings, LLC, have been included since the November 14, 2021 and November 22, 2021 acquisition dates, respectively. For our results of operations at December 31, 2019 see Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021.\nRevenues\nService revenue, net. Service revenue for our NEMT segment includes contracts predominately with state Medicaid agencies and MCOs for the coordination of their members' non-emergency transportation needs. Most contracts are capitated, which means we are paid on a per-member, per-month basis for each eligible member. For most contracts, we arrange for transportation of members through our network of independent transportation providers, whereby we negotiate rates and remit payment to the transportation providers. However, for certain contracts, we assume no risk for the transportation network, credentialing and/or payments to these providers. For these contracts, we only provide administrative management services to support the customers' efforts to serve their clients.\nCertain other contracts are structured as fee-for-service (\"FFS\") in which we bill and collect a specified amount for each service that we provide. FFS revenue is recognized in the period in which the services are rendered and is reduced by the estimated impact of contractual allowances and policy discounts in the case of third-party payors.\nService revenue for our Personal Care segment includes hours incurred by our in-home caregivers that are billed to our customers. Our customers consist of third-party payors including, but not limited to, MCOs, hospitals, Medicaid agencies and programs and other home health care providers who subcontract the services of our caregivers.\nService revenue for our RPM segment includes the sale of monitoring equipment to our third party distributors as well as hours incurred by our Clinical Team for providing monitoring services that are billed to our customers. Our customers consist of national and regional health plans, government-funded benefit programs, healthcare provider organizations, and individuals.\nGrant Income\nGrant income. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received distributions of the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund targeted to offset lost revenue and expenditures incurred in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating Expenses\nService expense. Service Expense for our NEMT segment includes purchased transportation, operational payroll and other operational related costs. Purchased transportation includes the amounts we pay to third-party service providers and is typically dependent upon service volume. Operational payroll predominately includes our contact center operations, customer advocacy and transportation network team. Other operating expenses primarily include operational overhead costs, and operating facilities and related charges. Service expense for our Personal Care segment includes payroll and other operational related costs for our caregivers to provide in-home care. Service expense for our RPM segment primarily consists of salaries of employees in our contact centers, connectivity costs and occupancy costs.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense for all segments consists principally of salaries for administrative employees that indirectly support the operations, occupancy costs, marketing expenditures, insurance, and professional fees.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation within this caption includes infrastructure items such as computer hardware and software, office equipment, monitoring and vitals equipment, buildings, and leasehold improvements.\nAmortization expense is generated primarily from amortization of our intangible assets, including payor networks, trade names, developed technology, a non-compete agreement, an assembled workforce, and a New York LHCSA permit.\nOther Expenses (Income)\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense consists principally of interest payments on the Company's borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2021 under the Credit Facility and Senior Unsecured Notes, and amortization of deferred financing fees. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section below for further discussion of these borrowings.\nEquity in net income (loss) of investee. Equity in earnings of equity method investee consists of our proportionate share of equity earnings or losses from our Matrix equity investment.\nIncome tax expense (benefit). The Company is subject to federal taxation in the United States and state taxation in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.\nResults of Operations\nDiscontinued operations. During the periods presented, we completed the following disposition transactions, which resulted in the presentation of the related operations as Discontinued Operations.\n\u2022On November 1, 2015, we completed the sale of our former Human Services segment and since the completion of the sale, we have recorded additional expenses related to legal proceedings for an indemnified legal matter.\n\u2022On December 21, 2018, we completed the sale of substantially all of the operating subsidiaries of our former WD Services segment to APM and APM UK Holdings Limited, an affiliate of APM, except for the segment's employment services operations in Saudi Arabia. Our contractual counterparties in Saudi Arabia, including an entity owned by the Saudi Arabian government, assumed these operations beginning January 1, 2019. Wind down activities of our Saudi Arabian entity are included in our discontinued operations. Additionally, on June 11, 2018, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement to sell Ingeus France for a de minimis amount. The sale was effective on July 17, 2018.\nSee Note 22, Discontinued Operations, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.\nSegment reporting. Our segments reflect the manner in which our operations are organized and reviewed by management.\nWe operate in four reportable business segments: NEMT, Personal Care, RPM and the Matrix Investment. Prior to November 17, 2020, our primary operating segment was NEMT, which provides non-emergency medical transportation services. Our Personal Care segment is composed of the operations from two acquisitions: Simplura on November 18, 2020, which operates in the non-medical personal care service industry; and Care Finders on September 14, 2021, a personal care service provider with operations concentrated in the Northeast, with a scaled presence in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut. On September 22, 2021, we acquired VRI, resulting in the establishment of our RPM segment. VRI is a provider of remote patient monitoring solutions. Our investment in Matrix is also a reportable segment referred to as the Matrix Investment\u201d. Segment results are based on how our chief operating decision maker manages our business, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance. The operating results of our NEMT, Personal Care and RPM segments include revenue and expenses incurred by the segment, and the operating results of our NEMT segment also include our activities related to executive, accounting, finance, internal audit, tax, legal and certain strategic and corporate development functions for each segment. See Note 4, Segments, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on our segments.\nYear ended December 31, 2021 compared to year ended December 31, 2020\nThe following table sets forth results of operations and the percentage of consolidated total revenues represented by items in our consolidated statements of operations for 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage\nof Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage\nof Revenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenue, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,996,892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,368,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grant income </td> <td>5,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service expense </td> <td>1,584,298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,078,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.8% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense </td> <td>271,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>140,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>56,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>26,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>1,912,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,245,517 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>89,771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>123,158 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating expense: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net </td> <td>49,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>17,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity method investment\n</td> <td>40,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>105,559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td>8,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4% </td> <td> </td> <td>22,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net (income) loss of investee, net of tax </td> <td>38,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,411) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations </td> <td>(6,289) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3)% </td> <td> </td> <td>89,614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax </td> <td>(296) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td>(778) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,585) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nService revenue, net. Consolidated service revenue, net, for 2021 increased $628.2 million, or 45.9%, compared to 2020. Service revenue, net, for our NEMT segment increased by $169.0 million, primarily due to higher trip volume when compared to 2020, as trip volume was depressed in the prior year due to the impact of COVID-19. Service revenue, net, further increased incrementally by $441.6 million for our Personal Care segment due to the inclusion of the entire year of operating results of Simplura as compared to the small portion of operating results recognized in 2020 due to the acquisition in November 2020, as well as the inclusion of the operating results of Care Finders acquired in September 2021. The acquisition of VRI contributed $17.6 million to the service revenue, net. See our results of operations, segments, for further discussion.\nGrant income. Grant income for 2021 of $5.4 million is related to the receipt of payments from the COVID-19 Provider Relief Fund which was received for our Personal Care segment and is available to eligible providers who diagnose, test, or care for individuals with possible or actual cases of COVID-19, and have health care related expenses and lost revenues attributable to COVID-19.\nService expense.

Payroll and related costs increased further by $357.0 million, primarily related to incremental costs of $344.9 million in the Personal Care segment due to the acquisitions of Simplura and Care Finders.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense for 2021 increased $130.7 million, or 93.0%, compared to 2020, related to an increase of $62.1 million in our NEMT segment, primarily related to transaction costs for the acquisitions of Care Finders and VRI, as well as value enhancement projects. The increase was further attributable to $62.8 million of incremental costs related to the addition of the Personal Care segment. See our results of operations, segments, for further discussion.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization for 2021 increased $30.8 million, or 117.7%, compared to 2020 primarily as a result of intangible assets brought on under the WellRyde acquisition in the second quarter of 2021 and under the Care Finders and VRI acquisitions in the third quarter of 2021. Additionally, this figure includes depreciation and amortization for Simplura for the entire year as compared to the prior year when Simplura was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2020. See Note 3, Acquisitions.\nInterest expense, net. Consolidated interest expense for 2021 increased $31.5 million, or 178.9%, compared to 2020. Interest expense increased as a result of the activity related to the $500.0 million Senior Notes due 2025 and the $500.0 million Senior Notes due 2029, that were issued on November 4, 2020 and August 24, 2021, respectively. We incurred $31.7 million and $9.1 million of interest expense related to the Senior Notes due 2025 and the Senior Notes due 2029 during the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively.\nEquity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax. Our equity in net income (loss) of investee for 2021 and 2020 represents our proportional share of the results of Matrix, of which we own 43.6%. See further discussion at the Matrix segment in our results of operations - segments section.\nProvision for income taxes. Our effective tax rates from continuing operations for 2021 and 2020 were a provision of 21.5% and 21.2%, respectively. The 2021 effective tax rate was slightly higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to state income taxes and certain non-deductible expenses, offset by tax credits and stock-based compensation windfalls. For 2020, the effective tax rate was slightly higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to state income taxes and certain non-deductible expenses offset by the favorable impact of the CARES Act on the Company's 2018 U.S. net operating losses (NOLs).\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax. Loss from discontinued operations includes the activity related to our former WD Services segment. See Note 22, Discontinued Operations, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nFor a comparison of our results of operations see Part II, Item 7.

Service revenue, net, increased by $169.0 million and 12.9%, from 2020 to 2021. This increase is primarily attributable to $59.0 million of revenue related to higher membership and increased trip volume in addition to $110.0 million of revenue related to contracts from the NMT acquisition that took place in the second quarter of 2020. Trip volume increased for the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to 2020, as trip volume was depressed in the prior year due to the impact of COVID-19. While a majority of our contacts are capitated and we receive monthly payments on a per member/fixed basis in return for full or partial risk of transportation volumes, we have certain contracts that limit profit to within a certain corridor and once we reach the maximum profit level we discontinue recognizing revenue and instead build a liability to return back to the customer upon reconciliation at a later date. Other contracts that are structured as fee-for-service also experienced positive impacts to revenue due to higher trip volumes.\nService expense. Service expense for our NEMT segment primarily consists of transportation costs paid to third party service providers, salaries of employees within our contact centers and operations centers, and occupancy costs. Service expense increased by $149.9 million and 14.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily related to higher purchased services of $145.8 million related to an increase in transportation costs and associated payroll costs in our contact centers due to higher trip volume in the current year.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries for administrative employees that indirectly support the operations, occupancy costs, marketing expenditures, insurance, and professional fees. General and administrative expense increased by $62.1 million and 46.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of $26.3 million related to personnel expense, $21.4 million related to the acquisitions of WellRyde, Care Finders and VRI, $7.6 million in legal expense, and $2.5 million related to occupancy expense.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $4.5 million and 18.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of a full year of amortization on the NMT intangibles in 2021, as compared to only five months of amortization in 2020, and the addition of acquired intangibles during 2021 related to the acquisition of WellRyde.\nPersonal Care Segment\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Segment Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Segment Revenue </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenue, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>495,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grant income </td> <td>5,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service expense </td> <td>392,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>42,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.8% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense </td> <td>70,163 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>7,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.6% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>23,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Personal Care segment was established in November 2020 with the acquisition of Simplura and expanded in September 2021 with the acquisition of Care Finders. Our personal care segment's services include placements of non-medical personal care assistants and home health aides and nurses primarily to Medicaid patient populations in need of care monitoring and assistance performing daily living activities in the home setting, including senior citizens and disabled adults. The year over year fluctuations are not comparable, as there was only two months of activity in 2020 and a full year in 2021.\nService revenue, net. Personal care service contracts are generally structured as fee-for-service contracts, with revenue being driven by hours worked by the personal care providers. Service revenue, net, from MCO contracts accounted for 60.3% of service revenue, net, for the year ended December 31, 2021, while U.S. State Medicaid program contracts accounted for 33.0% of service revenue, net for the year ended December 31, 2021. The remainder of the Personal Care segment revenue is derived from private pay and other contracts.\nGrant Income. In the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received distributions of the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund of approximately $5.4 million targeted to offset lost revenue and unreimbursed expenditures incurred in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nService expense. Service expense for our personal care segment primarily consists of salaries for the employees providing the personal care services and it typically trends with the number of hours worked. For the year ended December 31, 2021, service expense for the Personal Care segment includes $43.2 million related to the Care Finders acquisition, with the remainder related to Simplura.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries for administrative employees that indirectly support the operations, occupancy costs, marketing expenditures, insurance, and professional fees. General and administrative expense for the Personal Care segment includes $12.8 million related to the Care Finders acquisition, with the remainder being related to Simplura.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of amortization expense on the intangible assets brought on under the Simplura acquisition of $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to only a portion of the year in 2020.\nRPM Segment\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Segment Revenue </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenue, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service expense </td> <td>5,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.8% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense </td> <td>5,771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.8% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>4,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.7% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,060 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.7% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Remote Patient Monitoring segment was established in September 2021 with the acquisition of VRI. VRI is a provider of remote patient monitoring solutions and manages a comprehensive suite of services, including personal emergency response systems, vitals monitoring and data-driven patient engagement solutions.\nService revenue, net. RPM contracts are generally structured as a fee per enrolled member per month, and therefore revenue is generally driven by number of enrolled members. Service revenue, net, from MCO contracts accounted for 53.7% of service revenue, net, for the year ended December 31, 2021, while U.S. State Medicaid program contracts accounted for 28.4% of service revenue, net for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Matrix maintains a national network of community-based clinicians who deliver in-home and on-site services, and a fleet of mobile health clinics that provide community-based care with advanced diagnostic capabilities and enhanced care options.\nEquity in net income (loss) of investee changed from income of $6.4 million for the year ended 2020 to a loss of $38.3 million for the year ended 2021. Revenue over this period decreased by $16.4 million, operating expenses increased by $21.7 million and a $111.4 million impairment was taken in 2021. The decrease in revenue is due to the decline in COVID-19 testing and screening in the Clinical Solutions business, which is offset by an increase in year over year volume by 122 thousand visits in the Clinical Care business. Operating expenses increased due to an increase in visits, investments in Clinical Solutions, Lab, and Clinical Trials, and consulting fees to move the IT platform to the cloud, re-engineer Clinical Care, and stand up Clinical Solutions infrastructure.\nMatrix reported that its net loss for 2021 was negatively impacted by its Clinical Solutions business, which had a decrease in revenue due to a faster than expected vaccination rollout and winding down of COVID testing, which was offset by the launch of its clinical trials business in the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, Matrix reported increased revenue and income related to a clinical solutions product offering following the October 2020 acquisition of Biocerna LLC, a diagnostic company that, among other tests, provides rapid COVID-19 test kits.\nSeasonality\nOur NEMT segment's operating income and cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business, principally due to lower transportation demand during the winter season and higher demand during the summer season.\nOur Personal Care segment's operating income and cash flows also normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in the business, principally due to somewhat lower demand for in-home services from caregivers during the summer and periods with major holidays, as patients may spend more time with family and less time alone needing outside care during those periods.\nOur RPM segment's operating income and cash flows do not normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in the business.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nShort-term capital requirements consist primarily of recurring operating expenses, new revenue contract start-up costs and costs associated with our strategic initiatives. We expect to meet our cash requirements through available cash on hand, cash generated from operations, net of capital expenditures, and borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities entered into from time to time.\nCash flow from operating activities was $186.8 million in 2021. Our balance of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $133.4 million and $183.4 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We had restricted cash of $0.3 million and $0.1 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Restricted cash amounts are not included in our balance of cash and cash equivalents in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, although they are included in the cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balance on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.\nWe may, from time to time, access capital markets to raise equity or debt financing for various business reasons, including acquisitions and possible refinancing activity. We may also raise debt financing to fund future repurchases of our common stock and possible debt refinancing activity. The timing, term, size, and pricing of any such financing will depend on investor interest and market conditions, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing on terms acceptable to us at the time or at all.\n2021 cash flows compared to 2020\nOperating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $186.8 million for 2021 compared to $348.4 million in 2020. The decrease of $161.6 million was primarily a result of a $95.4 million decrease in net income, primarily attributable to the loss in our Matrix investment of $38.3 million net of tax, along with a $56.8 million decrease in cash used for accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a $67.3 million decrease in cash related to accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in cash of $31.0 million related to higher accrued transportation costs and an increase in cash of $27.6 million related to higher amortization expense.\nInvesting activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $685.6 million in 2021 compared to $635.0 million in 2020. The change in cash used in investing was driven by increased cash used for acquisitions of $41.4 million, primarily attributable to net cash outflows of $12.5 million related to the asset purchase of WellRyde in May 2021, $333.4 million related to the acquisition of Care Finders in September 2021, and $314.6 million related to the acquisition of VRI in September 2021, which were in excess of cash outflows for our acquisitions of Simplura and NMT that occurred in 2020.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $448.9 million in 2021 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $408.3 million in 2020. The increase of $40.6 million in 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase of $88.8 million of cash that was not used for redemptions of preferred stock, partially offset by a decrease of $29.8 million of cash used in the repurchase of company common stock in 2021.\nWe also had increased borrowings on our Credit Facility throughout 2021 that allowed us the temporary liquidity needed during the year to execute our acquisitions and stock buyback program. As of December 31, 2021 we had no borrowings on our Credit Facility or our New Credit Facility.\n2020 cash flows compared to 2019\nFor a comparison of our cash flows for the 2020 period to the 2019 period, see Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021.\nObligations and commitments\nSenior Unsecured Notes. On November 4, 2020, the Company issued $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior unsecured notes due on November 15, 2025 (the Senior Notes due 2025\u201d). Subsequently, on August 24, 2021, the Company issued an additional $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior unsecured notes due on October 1, 2029 (the Senior Notes due 2029\u201dand, together with the Senior Notes due 2025, the Notes\u201d). The Senior Notes due 2025 and the Senior Notes due 2029 were issued pursuant to two indentures, dated November 4, 2020 and August 24, 2021, respectively, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The proceeds from the Senior Notes due 2025 were used to fund a portion of the Company's acquisition of Simplura and the proceeds from the Senior Notes due 2029 were used to fund a portion of the Company's acquisition of VRI.\nThe Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company's future subordinated indebtedness, rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's existing senior indebtedness, are effectively subordinated to any of the Company's existing and future secured indebtedness, including indebtedness under the New Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and are structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future liabilities (including trade payables) of each of the Company's non-guarantor subsidiaries.\nThe Company will pay interest on the Notes at their applicable annual rates until maturity. Interest on the Senior Notes due 2025 is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. Interest on the Senior Notes due 2029 is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, with the first interest payment date being April 1, 2022. Principal payments are not required until the maturity date on November 15, 2025 and October 1, 2029 when 100% of the outstanding principal will be required to be repaid on the Senior Notes due 2025 and the Senior Notes due 2029, respectively.\nCredit Facility. At December 31, 2021, the Company was a party to the amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement, dated as of August 2, 2013 (as amended, the Credit Agreement\u201d), with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and letter of credit issuer, and the other lenders party thereto. Among the other amendments to the Credit Agreement since its execution in 2013, on May 6, 2020, the Company amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, extend the then stated maturity date to August 1, 2021, expand the amount available under the related revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) from $200.0 million to $225.0 million, and increased the sub-facility for letters of credit from $25.0 million to $40.0 million.\nSubsequently, on October 16, 2020, the Company further amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, permit the incurrence of additional debt to finance the acquisition of Simplura, permit borrowing under the Credit Facility to partially fund the Simplura Acquisition with limited conditions to such borrowing, increase the top interest rate margin that may have applied to loans thereunder, revise the permitted ratio of EBITDA to indebtedness, and extend the maturity date to August 2, 2023. See Note 3, Acquisitions, for further information on the Simplura acquisition. Thereafter, on September 13, 2021, the Company again amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, permit the incurrence of additional debt to finance the acquisition of VRI and revise certain financial covenants to permit the consummation of the VRI acquisition. See Note 3, Acquisitions, for further information on the VRI acquisition.\nFollowing the amendment associated with the VRI acquisition, interest on the outstanding principal amount of loans under the Credit Facility accrued, at the Company's election, at a per annum rate equal to the greater of either LIBOR or 1.00%, plus an applicable margin, or the Base Rate as defined in the Credit Agreement plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin ranged from 2.25% to 3.50% in the case of LIBOR loans and 1.25% to 2.50% in the case of the Base Rate loans, in each case, based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement that governed the Credit Facility. The commitment fee and letter of credit fee ranged from 0.35% to 0.50% and 2.25% to 3.50%, respectively, in each case based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement that governed the Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and it was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2021.\nNew Credit Facility. On February 3, 2022, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and an issuing bank, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as an issuing bank, Truist Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-syndication agents, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Bank of America, N.A., Regions Bank, Bank of Montreal and Capital One, National Association, as co-documentation agents, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Truist Securities, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers, and the other lenders party thereto. The New Credit Agreement provides the Company with a senior secured revolving credit facility (the New Credit Facility\u201d) in an aggregate principal amount of $325.0 million. There is an option to increase the amount of the New Credit Facility or obtain incremental term loans by an aggregate amount of up to $175.0 million, plus an unlimited amount so long as the pro forma secured net leverage ratio does not exceed 3.50:1.00, as described below. The New Credit Facility includes sublimits for swingline loans, letters of credit and alternative currency loans in amounts of up to $25.0 million, $60.0 million and $75.0 million, respectively. The Company did not draw any amount of the New Credit Facility at closing of the New Credit Agreement. At closing of the New Credit Agreement, the Company had $22.8 million of outstanding letters of credit under the New Credit Facility. The proceeds of the New Credit Facility may be used (i) to finance working capital needs of the Company and its subsidiaries and (ii) for general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries (including to finance capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions and investments). The New Credit Facility replaces the Credit Facility under the Credit Agreement, which was terminated concurrently with the Company's entry into the New Credit Agreement.\nUnder the New Credit Facility the Company has an option to request an increase in the amount of the New Credit Facility or obtain incremental term loans from time to time (on substantially the same terms as apply to the existing facilities) by an aggregate amount of up to $175.0 million, plus an unlimited amount so long as the pro forma secured net leverage ratio does not exceed 3.50:1.00, with either additional commitments from lenders under the New Credit Agreement at such time or new commitments from financial institutions approved by the Company and the administrative agent (which approval is not to be unreasonably withheld), so long as, at the time of any such increase, no default or event of default exists, the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the New Credit Agreement are true and correct in all material respects and the Company is in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants in the New Credit Agreement. The Company may not be able to access additional funds under this increase option as no lender is obligated to participate in any such increase under the New Credit Facility.\nThe New Credit Facility matures on February 3, 2027. The Company may prepay the New Credit Facility in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to reimbursement of the lenders' breakage and redeployment costs in connection with prepayments of Term Benchmark loans or RFR loans, each as defined in the New Credit Agreement. The unutilized portion of the commitments under the New Credit Facility may be irrevocably reduced or terminated by the Company at any time without penalty.\nInterest on the outstanding principal amount of the loans accrues at a per annum rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate or the Adjusted Daily Simple SONIA Rate, as applicable and each as defined in the New Credit Agreement, in each case, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from 1.75% to 3.50% in the case of Term Benchmark loans or RFR loans, each as defined in the Credit Agreement, and 0.75% to 2.50% in the case of the Alternate Base Rate loans, in each case, based on the Company's total net leverage ratio as defined in the New Credit Agreement. Interest on the loans is payable quarterly in arrears in the case of Alternate Base Rate loans, on the last day of the relevant interest period in the case of Term Benchmark loan, and monthly in arrears in the case of RFR loans. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee based on a percentage of the unused portion of the revolving credit facility and quarterly letter of credit fees based on a percentage of the maximum amount available to be drawn under each outstanding letter of credit. The commitment fee and letter of credit fee ranges from 0.30% to 0.50% and 1.75% to 3.50%, respectively, in each case, based on the Company's total net leverage ratio.\nThe New Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The negative covenants include restrictions on the Company's ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens, make investments, give guarantees, pay dividends, sell assets and merge and consolidate. The Company is subject to financial covenants, including total net leverage and interest coverage covenants.\nThe Company's obligations under the New Credit Facility are guaranteed by all of the Company's present and future material domestic subsidiaries, excluding certain material domestic subsidiaries that are excluded from being guarantors pursuant to the terms of the New Credit Agreement. The Company's obligations under, and each guarantor's obligations under its guaranty of, the New Credit Facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the Company's or such guarantor's respective assets. If an event of default occurs, the required lenders may cause the administrative agent to declare all unpaid principal and any accrued and unpaid interest and all fees and expenses under the New Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable. All amounts outstanding under the New Credit Facility will automatically become due and payable upon the commencement of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. The New Credit Agreement also contains a cross default to any of the Company's indebtedness having a principal amount in excess of $40 million.\nPreferred Stock. On June 8, 2020, the Company entered into a Preferred Stock Conversion Agreement (the \"Conversion Agreement\") with the Coliseum Stockholders. Pursuant to the Conversion Agreement, the Company purchased 369,120 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, in exchange for $209.88 in cash per share of Series A Preferred Stock, plus a cash amount equal to accrued but unpaid dividends on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock through the day prior to June 11, 2020. Further, the Coliseum Stockholders converted 369,120 shares of Series A Preferred Stock into 925,567 shares of common stock, a cash payment equal to accrued but unpaid dividends on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock through June 11, 2020, and a cash payment of $8.82 per share of Series A Preferred Stock. The amount of accrued dividends paid pursuant to the Conversion Agreement was equal to $0.8 million.\nFurther, on September 3, 2020, the Company elected to effect the conversion (the Conversion\u201d) of all of the outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. In accordance with the Conversion Agreement, as amended, immediately prior to the Conversion, the Company repurchased 27,509 shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Coliseum Shareholders for a cash amount equal to $209.88 per share of Series A Preferred Stock and a cash amount equal to accrued but unpaid dividends on such shares through the day prior to the Conversion.\nCash dividends on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were payable quarterly in arrears to the Preferred Shareholders on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year, and, if declared, began to accrue on the first day of the applicable dividend period. The Company had the option to pay dividends in kind, but never exercised such option while the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were outstanding. Convertible preferred stock dividends earned by the Coliseum Stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2020 were $2.0 million, including accrued dividends paid pursuant to the Conversion Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2021, no convertible preferred stock dividends were issued.\nInsurance Programs\nWith respect to the Company's historical wholly-owned captive insurance company subsidiary, Social Services Providers Captive Insurance Company, or SPCIC, the operations with respect to which have been discontinued since 2017, the Company utilizes a report prepared by an independent actuary to estimate the gross expected losses related to historical automobile, general and professional and workers' compensation liability reinsurance policies, including the estimated losses in excess of SPCIC's insurance limits, which would be reimbursed to SPCIC to the extent such losses were incurred. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had reserves of $8.3 million and $6.3 million, respectively, for the automobile, general and professional liability and workers' compensation reinsurance policies. The gross reserve as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 of $22.3 million and $15.1 million, respectively, is classified as other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The estimated amount to be reimbursed to the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $14.0 million and $8.8 million, respectively, and is classified as other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The increase in these amounts from 2020 to 2021 is largely attributable to the coverage of the Simplura business under our insurance programs.\nFurther, we had restricted cash of $0.3 million and $0.1 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, which was primarily restricted to secure the reinsured claims losses under the historical automobile, general and professional liability and workers' compensation reinsurance programs.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity measures our ability to meet current and future cash flow needs on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity position to meet our daily cash flow needs, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders. Our liquidity position is supported by management of liquid assets and liabilities and access to alternative sources of funds. Liquid assets include cash of $133.1 million and accounts receivable and other receivables of $237.9 million. Liquid liabilities totaled $638.7 million at year end as detailed in the table below. Other sources of liquidity include our New Credit Facility of $325.0 million.\nIn the ordinary course of business we have entered into contractual obligations and have made other commitments to make future payments. Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily to fund on-going operations. These liquidity requirements are met primarily through cash flow from operations of $186.8 million, debt financing, and our New Credit Facility of $325.0 million.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements, as discussed in Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nOverview of Our Business\nPlease refer to Item 1. Business\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our services and corporate strategy.\nModivCare Inc. (\"ModivCare\" or the \"Company\") is a technology-enabled healthcare services company that provides a suite of integrated supportive care solutions for public and private payors and their patients. Its value-based solutions address the social determinants of health, or SDoH, enable greater access to care, reduce costs, and improve outcomes. ModivCare is a provider of non-emergency medical transportation, or NEMT, personal care, and remote patient monitoring, or RPM, solutions. The technology-enabled operating model includes NEMT core competencies in risk underwriting, contact center management, network credentialing, claims management and non-emergency medical transportation management. Additionally, its personal care services include placements of non-medical personal care assistants, home health aides and nurses primarily to Medicaid patient populations in need of care monitoring and assistance performing daily living activities in the home setting, including senior citizens and disabled adults. ModivCare's remote patient monitoring services include personal emergency response systems, vitals monitoring and data-driven patient engagement solutions. ModivCare is further expanding its offerings to include meal delivery and working with communities to provide food-insecure individuals delivery of meals.\nModivCare's solutions help health plans manage risks, close care gaps, reduce costs, and connect members to care. Through the combination of its historical NEMT business, its in-home personal care business that consists of Simplura Health Group and Care Finders Total Care LLC, and its recent addition of the remote patient monitoring business through its acquisition of VRI Intermediate Holdings, LLC, ModivCare has united four complementary healthcare businesses that serve similar, highly vulnerable patient populations.\nModivCare also holds a 43.6% minority interest in CCHN Group Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, which operates under the Matrix Medical Network brand and which we refer to as Matrix\u201d. Matrix maintains a national network of community-based clinicians who deliver in-home and on-site services, and a fleet of mobile health clinics that provide community-based care with advanced diagnostic capabilities and enhanced care options. Matrix's clinical care business (\"Clinical Care\") provides risk adjustment solutions that improve health outcomes for individuals and financial performance for health plans. Matrix's clinical solutions business (\"Clinical Solutions\") provides employee health and wellness services focused on improving employee health with worksite certification solutions that reinforce business resilience and safe return-to-work outcomes. Its Clinical Solutions offerings also provide clinical trial services which support the delivery of safe and effective decentralized clinical trial operations to patients and eligible volunteers. Matrix also provides lab services, including services related to COVID-19 such as screening, testing, and vaccinations.\nBusiness Outlook and Trends\nOur performance is affected by a number of trends that drive the demand for our services. In particular, the markets in which we operate are exposed to various trends, such as healthcare industry and demographic dynamics. Over the long term, we believe there are numerous factors that could affect growth within the industries in which we operate, including:\n\u2022an aging population, which is expected to increase demand for healthcare services and transportation and, accordingly, in-home personal care services;\n\u2022increasing prevalence of chronic illnesses that require active and ongoing monitoring of health data which can be accomplished at a lower cost and result in better health outcomes through remote patient monitoring services;\n\u2022a movement towards value-based care versus fee-for-service and cost plus care and budget pressure on governments, both of which may increase the use of private corporations to provide necessary and innovative services;\n\u2022increasing demand for in-home care provision, driven by cost pressures on traditional reimbursement models and technological advances enabling remote engagement, including remote monitoring and similar internet-based health related services;\n\u2022technological advancements, which may be utilized by us to improve services and lower costs, but may also be utilized by others, which may increase industry competitiveness; and\n\u2022MCO, Medicaid and Medicare plans increasingly are covering NEMT services for a variety of reasons, including increased access to care, improved patient compliance with treatment plans, social trends, and to promote SDoH, and this trend may be accelerated or reinforced by The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (\"H.R.133\"), a component of which mandates that state Medicaid programs ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries have necessary transportation to and from health care providers.\nSince March 2020 and primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have observed a material reduction in trip volume in our NEMT segment as a result of state imposed public health orders, many of which reduced medical services to life-sustaining programs only (for example, dialysis and chemotherapy). This reduction in trip volume has had a negative financial impact on our transportation providers and may impact the availability of transportation providers in the future given the heightened sanitation requirements imposed on drivers and depressed volume.\nOur Personal Care segment business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience a material reduction in volume of service hours and visits. Volume has been reduced as members put services on hold due to infection concerns, and/or because they had the alternative of receiving care from family members and other caregivers working remotely or furloughed from their jobs. Cases have also been lost due to patient deaths, and new case referrals slowed as referral sources faced disruption from the various restrictions and public health orders. Our personal care service volumes are not expected to recover to pre-pandemic levels until the vaccination status of members in the markets where we provide services is at a higher rate where individuals feel comfortable receiving care and any current or future COVID-19 variants do not jeopardize the safety of vaccinated members. These depressed volumes will continue to result in lower than expected revenue, at least in the near term, in the Personal Care segment.\nOur RPM segment has not experienced a direct material impact to operations or financial activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While this segment of the business has proven resilient given the increase in demand for remote healthcare services in a highly contagious infection environment, potential risks could arise that could have a material impact on the financial results of the segment. Specifically, given the strain on the healthcare professionals that serve the healthcare community, we could experience shortages in qualified medical professionals that support our remote care monitoring business.\nFurthermore, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is continuously evolving, and the continuation of the pandemic, any additional resurgence, or COVID-19 variants could continue to change trends in the market.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. We base our estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThere are certain critical estimates that require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:\n\u2022it requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made; and\n\u2022changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAccrued Transportation Costs\nDescription. We generally pay our transportation providers for completed trips based on documentation submitted after services have been provided. The transportation service is initiated at the time a member submits a request for transportation services from our providers. At this time, we calculate an estimated transportation cost for each trip based on historical experience and contractual terms. This portion of the accrued transportation cost is based on requests for services we have received and the amount we expect to be billed by our transportation providers. All completed trips (both unbilled and billed) for which we have not yet issued payment reconcile to our total accrued transportation cost, however the critical\naccounting estimate that requires significant judgment is the portion of the accrual that is estimated at initiation of the member request.\nJudgments and Uncertainties. The transportation cost accrual requires significant judgment as it is calculated using contractual rates and mileage estimates, as well as an estimated rate for unknown cancellations given that members may have requested transportation without yet notifying the Company of cancellation. Based upon historical trip experience and contractual terms, we estimate the amount of transportation cost incurred for invoices which have not yet been submitted. The estimates are routinely monitored and compared to actual invoiced costs. Actual cost could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to facts and circumstances that differ from historical trends.\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change. The estimates for the transportation accrual are developed using assumptions based on the best information available to the Company at the time, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result, actual results may differ significantly from estimates. In determining our estimate each period, we use data around historical trip experience, current contractual rates, and mileage estimates and use a third party consultant to assist in development of the expected accrual. Our December 31, 2021 estimated portion of the accrued transportation costs was $3.5 million greater than our estimated portion in 2020 and $2.2 million less than our estimated portion in 2019. The decrease from 2019 to 2021 was a result of the overall decrease in trip volume during the COVID 19 pandemic. The assumptions used in the estimate inputs include estimated trip costs and estimated trip volume. If we were to assume that our estimate of future transportation costs was changed to the upper end or lower end of the range we developed in the course of formulating our estimate, the estimate for future transportation costs as of December 31, 2021 would range from $19.6 million to $23.9 million.\nBusiness Combinations\nDescription. We account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions at the date of acquisition as we allocate the value of the consideration assigned to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any excess purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Additionally, the economic lives assigned to the identifiable intangible assets requires significant judgments from management.\nJudgments and Uncertainties. When determining the fair value of the purchase price to be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, valuation techniques such as the income, cost, or market approach are used and third-party valuation experts are often consulted to assist in the calculation of fair value. Measurement of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on available historical information and expectations and assumptions about future performance. Critical assumptions that require estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimates and assumptions used in determining net future cash flows and the selection of respective discount rates.\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change. Estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result, actual results may differ significantly from estimates.\nOn November 18, 2020, the Company acquired Simplura for $569.8 million. The significant intangible assets identified include the payor network and the trade name. The payor network was determined to have a fair value of $221.0 million and was calculated using the multi-period excess earnings method which includes assumptions on the customer attrition rate, revenue growth rates, and discount rate. The trade name was determined to have a fair value of $43.0 million and was calculated using the relief-from-royalty method which includes assumptions on the revenue projections, royalty rates, and discount rates. Management used a third-party valuation specialist to assist in the allocation of fair value and believes the estimates applied are based upon reasonable assumptions, but understands that estimates of significant assumptions could change resulting in potential impairment losses in the future.\nOn September 14, 2021, the Company acquired Care Finders for $344.8 million. The significant intangible asset identified was the payor network. The payor network was determined to have a fair value of $97.2 million and was calculated using the multi-period excess earnings method which includes assumptions on customer attrition rate, revenue growth rates, and discount rate. Management used a third-party valuation specialist to assist in the allocation of fair value and believes the estimates applied are based upon reasonable assumptions, but understands that estimates of significant assumptions could change resulting in potential impairment losses in the future.\nOn September 22, 2021, the Company acquired VRI for $317.5 million. The significant intangible asset identified was the payor network. The payor network was determined to have a fair value of $72.2 million and was calculated using the multi-period excess earnings method which includes assumptions on customer attrition rate, revenue growth rates, and discount rate. Management used a third-party valuation specialist to assist in the allocation of fair value and believes the estimates applied are\nbased upon reasonable assumptions, but understands that estimates around significant assumptions could change resulting in potential impairment losses in the future.\nRecoverability of Goodwill\nDescription. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, we review goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to: (1) the loss or modification of significant contracts, (2) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (3) unanticipated competition, (4) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, or (5) a significant decline in our stock price. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1. Goodwill is allocated across the Company's reporting units: NEMT, Simplura, Care Finders, and VRI. We first perform qualitative assessments for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment suggests that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value amount, we then perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value is determined to exceed the estimated fair value, the asset is considered impaired.\nJudgments and Uncertainties. When performing a quantitative assessment to estimate the fair value of the Company's goodwill, the Company applies the discounted cash flow method which includes assumptions on the projected future cash flows, earnings, discount rates, working capital adjustments, long-term growth rates, and others.\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change. The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill may result in a different value recorded, which could result in an impairment charge that has the potential to have a material impact to the consolidated statement of operations. As of the date of our annual goodwill analysis, no goodwill impairment charges were recorded.\nIncome Taxes\nDescription. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, we record income tax expense for the amount of taxes payable or refundable in the current period and deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax reporting purposes. We determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, and we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in our current tax returns.\nJudgments and Uncertainties. Significant assumptions, judgments, and estimates are made by management when determining the income tax provision (benefit) for the current year, the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recorded, and the necessary valuation allowance to be recorded against the deferred tax asset. These judgements include interpretations of income tax regulations, estimates of future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and the likelihood of recovery of deferred tax assets or that a tax position will be sustained upon audit.\nWe consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes. We may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates.\nWe record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in our current tax returns. The determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position, taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position, based on technical merits, will be sustained upon examination. For those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not the position will be sustained, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. The difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability. While the Company believes all of its tax positions are fully supportable, the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded.\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change. If there are any changes in the underlying estimates and assumptions to calculate the current period income tax provision or deferred tax assets and liabilities, or if the settlement of tax issues from a current period audit results in a tax position that is no longer supported, the financial statements could be materially impacted. During the period ended December 31, 2021, the Company had recorded $0.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, in other long-term liabilities.\nResults of Operations\nThe following results of operations include the accounts of ModivCare and our subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The results of Care Finders Total Care and VRI Intermediate Holdings, LLC, have been included since the November 14, 2021 and November 22, 2021 acquisition dates, respectively. For our results of operations at December 31, 2019 see Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021.\nRevenues\nService revenue, net. Service revenue for our NEMT segment includes contracts predominately with state Medicaid agencies and MCOs for the coordination of their members' non-emergency transportation needs. Most contracts are capitated, which means we are paid on a per-member, per-month basis for each eligible member. For most contracts, we arrange for transportation of members through our network of independent transportation providers, whereby we negotiate rates and remit payment to the transportation providers. However, for certain contracts, we assume no risk for the transportation network, credentialing and/or payments to these providers. For these contracts, we only provide administrative management services to support the customers' efforts to serve their clients.\nCertain other contracts are structured as fee-for-service (\"FFS\") in which we bill and collect a specified amount for each service that we provide. FFS revenue is recognized in the period in which the services are rendered and is reduced by the estimated impact of contractual allowances and policy discounts in the case of third-party payors.\nService revenue for our Personal Care segment includes hours incurred by our in-home caregivers that are billed to our customers. Our customers consist of third-party payors including, but not limited to, MCOs, hospitals, Medicaid agencies and programs and other home health care providers who subcontract the services of our caregivers.\nService revenue for our RPM segment includes the sale of monitoring equipment to our third party distributors as well as hours incurred by our Clinical Team for providing monitoring services that are billed to our customers. Our customers consist of national and regional health plans, government-funded benefit programs, healthcare provider organizations, and individuals.\nGrant Income\nGrant income. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received distributions of the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund targeted to offset lost revenue and expenditures incurred in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating Expenses\nService expense. Service Expense for our NEMT segment includes purchased transportation, operational payroll and other operational related costs. Purchased transportation includes the amounts we pay to third-party service providers and is typically dependent upon service volume. Operational payroll predominately includes our contact center operations, customer advocacy and transportation network team. Other operating expenses primarily include operational overhead costs, and operating facilities and related charges. Service expense for our Personal Care segment includes payroll and other operational related costs for our caregivers to provide in-home care. Service expense for our RPM segment primarily consists of salaries of employees in our contact centers, connectivity costs and occupancy costs.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense for all segments consists principally of salaries for administrative employees that indirectly support the operations, occupancy costs, marketing expenditures, insurance, and professional fees.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation within this caption includes infrastructure items such as computer hardware and software, office equipment, monitoring and vitals equipment, buildings, and leasehold improvements.\nAmortization expense is generated primarily from amortization of our intangible assets, including payor networks, trade names, developed technology, a non-compete agreement, an assembled workforce, and a New York LHCSA permit.\nOther Expenses (Income)\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense consists principally of interest payments on the Company's borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2021 under the Credit Facility and Senior Unsecured Notes, and amortization of deferred financing fees. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section below for further discussion of these borrowings.\nEquity in net income (loss) of investee. Equity in earnings of equity method investee consists of our proportionate share of equity earnings or losses from our Matrix equity investment.\nIncome tax expense (benefit). The Company is subject to federal taxation in the United States and state taxation in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.\nResults of Operations\nDiscontinued operations. During the periods presented, we completed the following disposition transactions, which resulted in the presentation of the related operations as Discontinued Operations.\n\u2022On November 1, 2015, we completed the sale of our former Human Services segment and since the completion of the sale, we have recorded additional expenses related to legal proceedings for an indemnified legal matter.\n\u2022On December 21, 2018, we completed the sale of substantially all of the operating subsidiaries of our former WD Services segment to APM and APM UK Holdings Limited, an affiliate of APM, except for the segment's employment services operations in Saudi Arabia. Our contractual counterparties in Saudi Arabia, including an entity owned by the Saudi Arabian government, assumed these operations beginning January 1, 2019. Wind down activities of our Saudi Arabian entity are included in our discontinued operations. Additionally, on June 11, 2018, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement to sell Ingeus France for a de minimis amount. The sale was effective on July 17, 2018.\nSee Note 22, Discontinued Operations, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.\nSegment reporting. Our segments reflect the manner in which our operations are organized and reviewed by management.\nWe operate in four reportable business segments: NEMT, Personal Care, RPM and the Matrix Investment. Prior to November 17, 2020, our primary operating segment was NEMT, which provides non-emergency medical transportation services. Our Personal Care segment is composed of the operations from two acquisitions: Simplura on November 18, 2020, which operates in the non-medical personal care service industry; and Care Finders on September 14, 2021, a personal care service provider with operations concentrated in the Northeast, with a scaled presence in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut. On September 22, 2021, we acquired VRI, resulting in the establishment of our RPM segment. VRI is a provider of remote patient monitoring solutions. Our investment in Matrix is also a reportable segment referred to as the Matrix Investment\u201d. Segment results are based on how our chief operating decision maker manages our business, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance. The operating results of our NEMT, Personal Care and RPM segments include revenue and expenses incurred by the segment, and the operating results of our NEMT segment also include our activities related to executive, accounting, finance, internal audit, tax, legal and certain strategic and corporate development functions for each segment. See Note 4, Segments, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on our segments.\nYear ended December 31, 2021 compared to year ended December 31, 2020\nThe following table sets forth results of operations and the percentage of consolidated total revenues represented by items in our consolidated statements of operations for 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\n\nService revenue, net. Consolidated service revenue, net, for 2021 increased $628.2 million, or 45.9%, compared to 2020. Service revenue, net, for our NEMT segment increased by $169.0 million, primarily due to higher trip volume when compared to 2020, as trip volume was depressed in the prior year due to the impact of COVID-19. Service revenue, net, further increased incrementally by $441.6 million for our Personal Care segment due to the inclusion of the entire year of operating results of Simplura as compared to the small portion of operating results recognized in 2020 due to the acquisition in November 2020, as well as the inclusion of the operating results of Care Finders acquired in September 2021. The acquisition of VRI contributed $17.6 million to the service revenue, net. See our results of operations, segments, for further discussion.\nGrant income. Grant income for 2021 of $5.4 million is related to the receipt of payments from the COVID-19 Provider Relief Fund which was received for our Personal Care segment and is available to eligible providers who diagnose, test, or care for individuals with possible or actual cases of COVID-19, and have health care related expenses and lost revenues attributable to COVID-19.\nService expense. Service expense components are shown below (in thousands):\n\nService expense for 2021 increased $505.5 million, or 46.9%, compared to 2020 due to higher purchased services of $145.8 million related to an increase in transportation costs and associated payroll costs in our contact centers for our NEMT segment to support higher trip volumes in 2021. Payroll and related costs increased further by $357.0 million, primarily related to incremental costs of $344.9 million in the Personal Care segment due to the acquisitions of Simplura and Care Finders.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense for 2021 increased $130.7 million, or 93.0%, compared to 2020, related to an increase of $62.1 million in our NEMT segment, primarily related to transaction costs for the acquisitions of Care Finders and VRI, as well as value enhancement projects. The increase was further attributable to $62.8 million of incremental costs related to the addition of the Personal Care segment. See our results of operations, segments, for further discussion.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization for 2021 increased $30.8 million, or 117.7%, compared to 2020 primarily as a result of intangible assets brought on under the WellRyde acquisition in the second quarter of 2021 and under the Care Finders and VRI acquisitions in the third quarter of 2021. Additionally, this figure includes depreciation and amortization for Simplura for the entire year as compared to the prior year when Simplura was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2020. See Note 3, Acquisitions.\nInterest expense, net. Consolidated interest expense for 2021 increased $31.5 million, or 178.9%, compared to 2020. Interest expense increased as a result of the activity related to the $500.0 million Senior Notes due 2025 and the $500.0 million Senior Notes due 2029, that were issued on November 4, 2020 and August 24, 2021, respectively. We incurred $31.7 million and $9.1 million of interest expense related to the Senior Notes due 2025 and the Senior Notes due 2029 during the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively.\nEquity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax. Our equity in net income (loss) of investee for 2021 and 2020 represents our proportional share of the results of Matrix, of which we own 43.6%. See further discussion at the Matrix segment in our results of operations - segments section.\nProvision for income taxes. Our effective tax rates from continuing operations for 2021 and 2020 were a provision of 21.5% and 21.2%, respectively. The 2021 effective tax rate was slightly higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to state income taxes and certain non-deductible expenses, offset by tax credits and stock-based compensation windfalls. For 2020, the effective tax rate was slightly higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to state income taxes and certain non-deductible expenses offset by the favorable impact of the CARES Act on the Company's 2018 U.S. net operating losses (NOLs).\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax. Loss from discontinued operations includes the activity related to our former WD Services segment. See Note 22, Discontinued Operations, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nFor a comparison of our results of operations see Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021.\nResults of Operations - Segments\nThe following tables set forth certain financial information from continuing operations attributable to the Company's business segments (in thousands):\nNEMT Segment\n\nThe non-emergency medical transportation ( NEMT\u201d) segment, which operates under the brands ModivCare Solutions and Circulation, is the largest manager of NEMT programs for state governments and managed care organizations (\"MCOs\") in the U.S; and includes the Company's activities for executive, accounting, finance, internal audit, tax, legal and certain strategic and development functions.\nService revenue, net. Service revenue, net, increased by $169.0 million and 12.9%, from 2020 to 2021. This increase is primarily attributable to $59.0 million of revenue related to higher membership and increased trip volume in addition to $110.0 million of revenue related to contracts from the NMT acquisition that took place in the second quarter of 2020. Trip volume increased for the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to 2020, as trip volume was depressed in the prior year due to the impact of COVID-19. While a majority of our contacts are capitated and we receive monthly payments on a per member/fixed basis in return for full or partial risk of transportation volumes, we have certain contracts that limit profit to within a certain corridor and once we reach the maximum profit level we discontinue recognizing revenue and instead build a liability to return back to the customer upon reconciliation at a later date. Other contracts that are structured as fee-for-service also experienced positive impacts to revenue due to higher trip volumes.\nService expense. Service expense for our NEMT segment primarily consists of transportation costs paid to third party service providers, salaries of employees within our contact centers and operations centers, and occupancy costs. Service expense increased by $149.9 million and 14.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily related to higher purchased services of $145.8 million related to an increase in transportation costs and associated payroll costs in our contact centers due to higher trip volume in the current year.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries for administrative employees that indirectly support the operations, occupancy costs, marketing expenditures, insurance, and professional fees. General and administrative expense increased by $62.1 million and 46.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of $26.3 million related to personnel expense, $21.4 million related to the acquisitions of WellRyde, Care Finders and VRI, $7.6 million in legal expense, and $2.5 million related to occupancy expense.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $4.5 million and 18.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of a full year of amortization on the NMT intangibles in 2021, as compared to only five months of amortization in 2020, and the addition of acquired intangibles during 2021 related to the acquisition of WellRyde.\nPersonal Care Segment\n\nOur Personal Care segment was established in November 2020 with the acquisition of Simplura and expanded in September 2021 with the acquisition of Care Finders. Our personal care segment's services include placements of non-medical personal care assistants and home health aides and nurses primarily to Medicaid patient populations in need of care monitoring and assistance performing daily living activities in the home setting, including senior citizens and disabled adults. The year over year fluctuations are not comparable, as there was only two months of activity in 2020 and a full year in 2021.\nService revenue, net. Personal care service contracts are generally structured as fee-for-service contracts, with revenue being driven by hours worked by the personal care providers. Service revenue, net, from MCO contracts accounted for 60.3% of service revenue, net, for the year ended December 31, 2021, while U.S. State Medicaid program contracts accounted for 33.0% of service revenue, net for the year ended December 31, 2021. The remainder of the Personal Care segment revenue is derived from private pay and other contracts.\nGrant Income. In the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received distributions of the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund of approximately $5.4 million targeted to offset lost revenue and unreimbursed expenditures incurred in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nService expense. Service expense for our personal care segment primarily consists of salaries for the employees providing the personal care services and it typically trends with the number of hours worked. For the year ended December 31, 2021, service expense for the Personal Care segment includes $43.2 million related to the Care Finders acquisition, with the remainder related to Simplura.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries for administrative employees that indirectly support the operations, occupancy costs, marketing expenditures, insurance, and professional fees. General and administrative expense for the Personal Care segment includes $12.8 million related to the Care Finders acquisition, with the remainder being related to Simplura.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of amortization expense on the intangible assets brought on under the Simplura acquisition of $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to only a portion of the year in 2020.\nRPM Segment\n\nOur Remote Patient Monitoring segment was established in September 2021 with the acquisition of VRI. VRI is a provider of remote patient monitoring solutions and manages a comprehensive suite of services, including personal emergency response systems, vitals monitoring and data-driven patient engagement solutions.\nService revenue, net. RPM contracts are generally structured as a fee per enrolled member per month, and therefore revenue is generally driven by number of enrolled members. Service revenue, net, from MCO contracts accounted for 53.7% of service revenue, net, for the year ended December 31, 2021, while U.S. State Medicaid program contracts accounted for 28.4% of service revenue, net for the year ended December 31, 2021. The remainder of the RPM segment revenue is derived from private pay and other contracts.\nService expense. Service expense for our RPM segment primarily consists of salaries for the employees providing the remote monitoring services and it typically trends with the number of hours worked.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries for administrative employees that indirectly support the operations, occupancy costs, marketing expenditures, insurance, and professional fees.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of amortization expense on the intangible assets brought on during the acquisition as well as depreciation on the fixed assets acquired.\nMatrix Segment\n\nThe company holds a 43.6% minority interest in CCHN Group Holdings, Inc., and its subsidiaries, which operates under the Matrix Medical Network brand, which we refer to as Matrix\u201d. Matrix maintains a national network of community-based clinicians who deliver in-home and on-site services, and a fleet of mobile health clinics that provide community-based care with advanced diagnostic capabilities and enhanced care options.\nEquity in net income (loss) of investee changed from income of $6.4 million for the year ended 2020 to a loss of $38.3 million for the year ended 2021. Revenue over this period decreased by $16.4 million, operating expenses increased by $21.7 million and a $111.4 million impairment was taken in 2021. The decrease in revenue is due to the decline in COVID-19 testing and screening in the Clinical Solutions business, which is offset by an increase in year over year volume by 122 thousand visits in the Clinical Care business. Operating expenses increased due to an increase in visits, investments in Clinical Solutions, Lab, and Clinical Trials, and consulting fees to move the IT platform to the cloud, re-engineer Clinical Care, and stand up Clinical Solutions infrastructure.\nMatrix reported that its net loss for 2021 was negatively impacted by its Clinical Solutions business, which had a decrease in revenue due to a faster than expected vaccination rollout and winding down of COVID testing, which was offset by the launch of its clinical trials business in the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, Matrix reported increased revenue and income related to a clinical solutions product offering following the October 2020 acquisition of Biocerna LLC, a diagnostic company that, among other tests, provides rapid COVID-19 test kits.\nSeasonality\nOur NEMT segment's operating income and cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business, principally due to lower transportation demand during the winter season and higher demand during the summer season.\nOur Personal Care segment's operating income and cash flows also normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in the business, principally due to somewhat lower demand for in-home services from caregivers during the summer and periods with major holidays, as patients may spend more time with family and less time alone needing outside care during those periods.\nOur RPM segment's operating income and cash flows do not normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in the business.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nShort-term capital requirements consist primarily of recurring operating expenses, new revenue contract start-up costs and costs associated with our strategic initiatives. We expect to meet our cash requirements through available cash on hand, cash generated from operations, net of capital expenditures, and borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities entered into from time to time.\nCash flow from operating activities was $186.8 million in 2021. Our balance of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $133.4 million and $183.4 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We had restricted cash of $0.3 million and $0.1 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Restricted cash amounts are not included in our balance of cash and cash equivalents in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, although they are included in the cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balance on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.\nWe may, from time to time, access capital markets to raise equity or debt financing for various business reasons, including acquisitions and possible refinancing activity. We may also raise debt financing to fund future repurchases of our common stock and possible debt refinancing activity. The timing, term, size, and pricing of any such financing will depend on investor interest and market conditions, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing on terms acceptable to us at the time or at all.\n2021 cash flows compared to 2020\nOperating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $186.8 million for 2021 compared to $348.4 million in 2020. The decrease of $161.6 million was primarily a result of a $95.4 million decrease in net income, primarily attributable to the loss in our Matrix investment of $38.3 million net of tax, along with a $56.8 million decrease in cash used for accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a $67.3 million decrease in cash related to accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in cash of $31.0 million related to higher accrued transportation costs and an increase in cash of $27.6 million related to higher amortization expense.\nInvesting activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $685.6 million in 2021 compared to $635.0 million in 2020. The change in cash used in investing was driven by increased cash used for acquisitions of $41.4 million, primarily attributable to net cash outflows of $12.5 million related to the asset purchase of WellRyde in May 2021, $333.4 million related to the acquisition of Care Finders in September 2021, and $314.6 million related to the acquisition of VRI in September 2021, which were in excess of cash outflows for our acquisitions of Simplura and NMT that occurred in 2020.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $448.9 million in 2021 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $408.3 million in 2020. The increase of $40.6 million in 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase of $88.8 million of cash that was not used for redemptions of preferred stock, partially offset by a decrease of $29.8 million of cash used in the repurchase of company common stock in 2021.\nWe also had increased borrowings on our Credit Facility throughout 2021 that allowed us the temporary liquidity needed during the year to execute our acquisitions and stock buyback program. As of December 31, 2021 we had no borrowings on our Credit Facility or our New Credit Facility.\n2020 cash flows compared to 2019\nFor a comparison of our cash flows for the 2020 period to the 2019 period, see Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021.\nObligations and commitments\nSenior Unsecured Notes. On November 4, 2020, the Company issued $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior unsecured notes due on November 15, 2025 (the Senior Notes due 2025\u201d). Subsequently, on August 24, 2021, the Company issued an additional $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior unsecured notes due on October 1, 2029 (the Senior Notes due 2029\u201dand, together with the Senior Notes due 2025, the Notes\u201d). The Senior Notes due 2025 and the Senior Notes due 2029 were issued pursuant to two indentures, dated November 4, 2020 and August 24, 2021, respectively, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The proceeds from the Senior Notes due 2025 were used to fund a portion of the Company's acquisition of Simplura and the proceeds from the Senior Notes due 2029 were used to fund a portion of the Company's acquisition of VRI.\nThe Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company's future subordinated indebtedness, rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's existing senior indebtedness, are effectively subordinated to any of the Company's existing and future secured indebtedness, including indebtedness under the New Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and are structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future liabilities (including trade payables) of each of the Company's non-guarantor subsidiaries.\nThe Company will pay interest on the Notes at their applicable annual rates until maturity. Interest on the Senior Notes due 2025 is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. Interest on the Senior Notes due 2029 is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, with the first interest payment date being April 1, 2022. Principal payments are not required until the maturity date on November 15, 2025 and October 1, 2029 when 100% of the outstanding principal will be required to be repaid on the Senior Notes due 2025 and the Senior Notes due 2029, respectively.\nCredit Facility. At December 31, 2021, the Company was a party to the amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement, dated as of August 2, 2013 (as amended, the Credit Agreement\u201d), with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and letter of credit issuer, and the other lenders party thereto. Among the other amendments to the Credit Agreement since its execution in 2013, on May 6, 2020, the Company amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, extend the then stated maturity date to August 1, 2021, expand the amount available under the related revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) from $200.0 million to $225.0 million, and increased the sub-facility for letters of credit from $25.0 million to $40.0 million.\nSubsequently, on October 16, 2020, the Company further amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, permit the incurrence of additional debt to finance the acquisition of Simplura, permit borrowing under the Credit Facility to partially fund the Simplura Acquisition with limited conditions to such borrowing, increase the top interest rate margin that may have applied to loans thereunder, revise the permitted ratio of EBITDA to indebtedness, and extend the maturity date to August 2, 2023. See Note 3, Acquisitions, for further information on the Simplura acquisition. Thereafter, on September 13, 2021, the Company again amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, permit the incurrence of additional debt to finance the acquisition of VRI and revise certain financial covenants to permit the consummation of the VRI acquisition. See Note 3, Acquisitions, for further information on the VRI acquisition.\nFollowing the amendment associated with the VRI acquisition, interest on the outstanding principal amount of loans under the Credit Facility accrued, at the Company's election, at a per annum rate equal to the greater of either LIBOR or 1.00%, plus an applicable margin, or the Base Rate as defined in the Credit Agreement plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin ranged from 2.25% to 3.50% in the case of LIBOR loans and 1.25% to 2.50% in the case of the Base Rate loans, in each case, based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement that governed the Credit Facility. The commitment fee and letter of credit fee ranged from 0.35% to 0.50% and 2.25% to 3.50%, respectively, in each case based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement that governed the Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and it was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2021.\nNew Credit Facility. On February 3, 2022, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and an issuing bank, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as an issuing bank, Truist Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-syndication agents, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Bank of America, N.A., Regions Bank, Bank of Montreal and Capital One, National Association, as co-documentation agents, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Truist Securities, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers, and the other lenders party thereto. The New Credit Agreement provides the Company with a senior secured revolving credit facility (the New Credit Facility\u201d) in an aggregate principal amount of $325.0 million. There is an option to increase the amount of the New Credit Facility or obtain incremental term loans by an aggregate amount of up to $175.0 million, plus an unlimited amount so long as the pro forma secured net leverage ratio does not exceed 3.50:1.00, as described below. The New Credit Facility includes sublimits for swingline loans, letters of credit and alternative currency loans in amounts of up to $25.0 million, $60.0 million and $75.0 million, respectively. The Company did not draw any amount of the New Credit Facility at closing of the New Credit Agreement. At closing of the New Credit Agreement, the Company had $22.8 million of outstanding letters of credit under the New Credit Facility. The proceeds of the New Credit Facility may be used (i) to finance working capital needs of the Company and its subsidiaries and (ii) for general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries (including to finance capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions and investments). The New Credit Facility replaces the Credit Facility under the Credit Agreement, which was terminated concurrently with the Company's entry into the New Credit Agreement.\nUnder the New Credit Facility the Company has an option to request an increase in the amount of the New Credit Facility or obtain incremental term loans from time to time (on substantially the same terms as apply to the existing facilities) by an aggregate amount of up to $175.0 million, plus an unlimited amount so long as the pro forma secured net leverage ratio does not exceed 3.50:1.00, with either additional commitments from lenders under the New Credit Agreement at such time or new commitments from financial institutions approved by the Company and the administrative agent (which approval is not to be unreasonably withheld), so long as, at the time of any such increase, no default or event of default exists, the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the New Credit Agreement are true and correct in all material respects and the Company is in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants in the New Credit Agreement. The Company may not be able to access additional funds under this increase option as no lender is obligated to participate in any such increase under the New Credit Facility.\nThe New Credit Facility matures on February 3, 2027. The Company may prepay the New Credit Facility in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to reimbursement of the lenders' breakage and redeployment costs in connection with prepayments of Term Benchmark loans or RFR loans, each as defined in the New Credit Agreement. The unutilized portion of the commitments under the New Credit Facility may be irrevocably reduced or terminated by the Company at any time without penalty.\nInterest on the outstanding principal amount of the loans accrues at a per annum rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate or the Adjusted Daily Simple SONIA Rate, as applicable and each as defined in the New Credit Agreement, in each case, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from 1.75% to 3.50% in the case of Term Benchmark loans or RFR loans, each as defined in the Credit Agreement, and 0.75% to 2.50% in the case of the Alternate Base Rate loans, in each case, based on the Company's total net leverage ratio as defined in the New Credit Agreement. Interest on the loans is payable quarterly in arrears in the case of Alternate Base Rate loans, on the last day of the relevant interest period in the case of Term Benchmark loan, and monthly in arrears in the case of RFR loans. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee based on a percentage of the unused portion of the revolving credit facility and quarterly letter of credit fees based on a percentage of the maximum amount available to be drawn under each outstanding letter of credit. The commitment fee and letter of credit fee ranges from 0.30% to 0.50% and 1.75% to 3.50%, respectively, in each case, based on the Company's total net leverage ratio.\nThe New Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The negative covenants include restrictions on the Company's ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens, make investments, give guarantees, pay dividends, sell assets and merge and consolidate. The Company is subject to financial covenants, including total net leverage and interest coverage covenants.\nThe Company's obligations under the New Credit Facility are guaranteed by all of the Company's present and future material domestic subsidiaries, excluding certain material domestic subsidiaries that are excluded from being guarantors pursuant to the terms of the New Credit Agreement. The Company's obligations under, and each guarantor's obligations under its guaranty of, the New Credit Facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the Company's or such guarantor's respective assets. If an event of default occurs, the required lenders may cause the administrative agent to declare all unpaid principal and any accrued and unpaid interest and all fees and expenses under the New Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable. All amounts outstanding under the New Credit Facility will automatically become due and payable upon the commencement of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. The New Credit Agreement also contains a cross default to any of the Company's indebtedness having a principal amount in excess of $40 million.\nPreferred Stock. On June 8, 2020, the Company entered into a Preferred Stock Conversion Agreement (the \"Conversion Agreement\") with the Coliseum Stockholders. Pursuant to the Conversion Agreement, the Company purchased 369,120 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, in exchange for $209.88 in cash per share of Series A Preferred Stock, plus a cash amount equal to accrued but unpaid dividends on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock through the day prior to June 11, 2020. Further, the Coliseum Stockholders converted 369,120 shares of Series A Preferred Stock into 925,567 shares of common stock, a cash payment equal to accrued but unpaid dividends on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock through June 11, 2020, and a cash payment of $8.82 per share of Series A Preferred Stock. The amount of accrued dividends paid pursuant to the Conversion Agreement was equal to $0.8 million.\nFurther, on September 3, 2020, the Company elected to effect the conversion (the Conversion\u201d) of all of the outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. In accordance with the Conversion Agreement, as amended, immediately prior to the Conversion, the Company repurchased 27,509 shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Coliseum Shareholders for a cash amount equal to $209.88 per share of Series A Preferred Stock and a cash amount equal to accrued but unpaid dividends on such shares through the day prior to the Conversion.\nCash dividends on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were payable quarterly in arrears to the Preferred Shareholders on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year, and, if declared, began to accrue on the first day of the applicable dividend period. The Company had the option to pay dividends in kind, but never exercised such option while the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were outstanding. Convertible preferred stock dividends earned by the Coliseum Stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2020 were $2.0 million, including accrued dividends paid pursuant to the Conversion Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2021, no convertible preferred stock dividends were issued.\nInsurance Programs\nWith respect to the Company's historical wholly-owned captive insurance company subsidiary, Social Services Providers Captive Insurance Company, or SPCIC, the operations with respect to which have been discontinued since 2017, the Company utilizes a report prepared by an independent actuary to estimate the gross expected losses related to historical automobile, general and professional and workers' compensation liability reinsurance policies, including the estimated losses in excess of SPCIC's insurance limits, which would be reimbursed to SPCIC to the extent such losses were incurred. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had reserves of $8.3 million and $6.3 million, respectively, for the automobile, general and professional liability and workers' compensation reinsurance policies. The gross reserve as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 of $22.3 million and $15.1 million, respectively, is classified as other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The estimated amount to be reimbursed to the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $14.0 million and $8.8 million, respectively, and is classified as other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The increase in these amounts from 2020 to 2021 is largely attributable to the coverage of the Simplura business under our insurance programs.\nFurther, we had restricted cash of $0.3 million and $0.1 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, which was primarily restricted to secure the reinsured claims losses under the historical automobile, general and professional liability and workers' compensation reinsurance programs.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity measures our ability to meet current and future cash flow needs on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity position to meet our daily cash flow needs, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders. Our liquidity position is supported by management of liquid assets and liabilities and access to alternative sources of funds. Liquid assets include cash of $133.1 million and accounts receivable and other receivables of $237.9 million. Liquid liabilities totaled $638.7 million at year end as detailed in the table below. Other sources of liquidity include our New Credit Facility of $325.0 million.\nIn the ordinary course of business we have entered into contractual obligations and have made other commitments to make future payments. Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily to fund on-going operations. These liquidity requirements are met primarily through cash flow from operations of $186.8 million, debt financing, and our New Credit Facility of $325.0 million. For additional information regarding our operating, investing and financing cash flows, see Consolidated Financial Statements-Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows,\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nThe Company has cash requirements of $638.7 million due in one year or less in addition to $1,398.9 million due in more than one year as of December 31, 2021. The following is a summary of our future cash requirements for the next twelve months and the period extending beyond twelve months as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):\n\n(1)See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further detail of our Senior Unsecured Notes and the timing of expected future payments. Interest payments are typically paid semi-annually in arrears and have been calculated at the rates fixed as of December 31, 2021.\n(2)Letters of credit ( LOCs\u201d) are guarantees of potential payments to third parties under certain conditions. Guarantees include surety bonds we provide to certain customers to protect against potential non-delivery of our non-emergency transportation services. Our LOCs shown in the table were provided by our Credit Facility and reduced our availability under the related Credit Agreement. The surety bonds and LOC amounts in the above table represent the amount of commitment expiration per period.\n(3)The operating leases are for office space. Certain leases contain periodic rent escalation adjustments and renewal options. See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further detail of our operating leases.\n(4)See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further detail of our contracts payable.\n(5)See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further detail of our accrued transportation cost.\n(6)These include other current liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021, including accounts payable and accrued expenses as detailed at Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d.\n(7)See Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further detail of our deferred tax liabilities.\nOur primary sources of funding include operating cash flows and access to capital markets. There are statutory, regulatory, and debt covenant limitations that affect our ability to access the capital market for funds. Management believes that such limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing short-term cash obligations. Management continuously monitors our liquidity position and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Our management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources, or operations. In addition, our management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity, which if implemented, would have a material adverse effect on us.\nStock repurchase programs\nOn August 6, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could repurchase up to $100.0 million in aggregate value of the Company's Common Stock, subject to the consent of the holders of a majority of the Company's Series A convertible preferred stock, through December 31, 2019, at which time it expired.
