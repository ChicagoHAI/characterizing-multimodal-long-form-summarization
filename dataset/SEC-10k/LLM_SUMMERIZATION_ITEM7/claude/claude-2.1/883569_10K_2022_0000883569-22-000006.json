Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Business, Item 1A. Risk Factors and our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results of operations may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those included in Item 1A. Risk Factors and other portions of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a global design, marketing and distribution company that specializes in consumer fashion accessories. Our principal offerings include an extensive line of men's and women's fashion watches and jewelry, handbags, small leather goods, belts, and sunglasses. In the watch and jewelry product categories, we have a diverse portfolio of globally recognized owned and licensed brand names under which our products are marketed.\nOur products are distributed globally through various distribution channels including wholesale in countries where we have a physical presence, direct to the consumer through our retail stores and commercial websites and through third-party distributors in countries where we do not maintain a physical presence. Our products are offered at varying price points to meet the needs of our customers, whether they are value-conscious or luxury oriented. Based on our range of accessory products, brands, distribution channels and price points, we are able to target style-conscious consumers across a wide age spectrum on a global basis.\nKnown or Anticipated Trends\nBased on our recent operating results and current perspectives on our operating environment, we anticipate the following trends will continue to impact our operating results:\nCOVID-19: Our business operations and financial performance continue to be materially impacted by COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the global economies, disrupted global supply chains and financial markets, and led to significant travel and transportation restrictions, including periodic mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and orders to shelter-in-place. We remain focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees, customers and suppliers to minimize potential disruptions and supporting the community to address challenges posed by the global COVID-19 pandemic. The total impact of the pandemic on our business is uncertain and depends in part on future developments including the duration and spread of COVID-19, the availability and acceptance of vaccines and continuing actions taken by governmental authorities to control the outbreak and mitigate its impact, including effects of any vaccine mandates, restrictions on movement and commercial activities and further stimulus and unemployment benefits.\nSupply Chain: Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing supply. We rely on domestic and foreign suppliers to provide us with merchandise in a timely manner and at favorable prices. Certain key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, which exposes us to potential supply shortages that could disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products. Any interruption or delay in the supply of key components could significantly harm our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and cause us to lose sales. Among our foreign suppliers, China is the source of a substantial majority of our imports. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, increased international transit times, particularly for our leathers products and packaging, and increased shipping costs for a majority of our products. A disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise from China or a material increase in the cost of those goods or transportation without any offsetting price increases may significantly decrease our profits.\nData Security: We depend on information technology systems, the Internet and computer networks for a substantial portion of our retail and e-commerce businesses, including credit card transaction authorization and processing. We also receive and store personal information about our customers and employees, the protection of which is critical to us. In the normal course of our business, we collect, retain, and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information, over public networks. Despite the security measures we currently have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers have been, and will continue to be, vulnerable to theft of physical information, security breaches, hacking attempts, computer viruses and malware, ransomware, phishing, lost data and programming and/or human errors. To date, none of these risks, intrusions, attacks or human error have resulted in any material liability to us. While we carry insurance policies that would provide liability coverage for certain of these matters, if we experience a significant security incident, we could be subject to liability or other damages that exceed our insurance coverage, and we cannot be certain that such insurance policies will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\nBusiness Strategies and Outlook: Notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic, we plan to execute the following strategies to enhance our brands, grow our revenue and improve profitability. The first strategic initiative is to increase brand excitement by crafting compelling stories that build upon brand equities for both owned and licensed brands across our product categories. Key to this strategy is our ongoing effort in innovation in our product categories and marketing capabilities, where we aim to build larger communities of brand loyalists. Our second strategic initiative is to increase digital engagement and online sales. We continue to invest in our owned e-commerce sites around the world and in third party marketplaces to enhance our direct to consumer engagement, which we believe can build long-term customer value. Our third strategic initiative is to optimize our operations. We initiated the New World Fossil - Transform to Grow (\"NWF 2.0\u201d) initiative in 2019 aimed to further simplify our operations and to reallocate resources toward growth, and we achieved our $250 million run-rate savings goal in 2021. Although we are nearing completion of our NWF 2.0 program, we will continue to optimize our operations with further reductions to our store footprint and increased focus on inventory management and supply chain efficiency. Our fourth strategic initiative is to expand our opportunity in mainland China and India. In these countries, we are continuing to execute against a strategy centered around localized marketing and segmented assortments. Although the impact of COVID-19 is likely to disrupt our growth trajectory in the short to intermediate term, we continue to view mainland China and India as compelling long-term opportunities.\nNotes Offering: In November 2021, we sold $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.00% Senior Notes due 2026. We used the majority of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes offering to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement (as defined below). In connection with the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement, we incurred prepayment fees and accrued interest costs of $2.6 million and wrote off $7.1 million of debt issuance costs and $4.6 million of original issuance discount related to the Term Credit Agreement. The remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes\nOperating Segments\nWe operate our business in three segments which are divided into geographies. Net sales for each geographic segment are based on the location of the selling entity and each reportable segment provides similar products and services.\nAmericas: The Americas segment is comprised of sales from our operations in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Sales are generated through diversified distribution channels that include wholesalers, distributors, and direct to consumer. Within each channel, we sell our products through a variety of physical point of sale, distributors and e-commerce channels. In the direct to consumer channel, we had 162 Company-owned stores as of the end of fiscal 2021 and an extensive collection of products available through our owned websites. As of the end of fiscal 2021, net sales in the Americas segment accounted for 42.0% of our consolidated revenue.\nEurope: The Europe segment is comprised of sales to customers based in European countries, the Middle East and Africa. Sales are generated through diversified distribution channels that include wholesalers, distributors and direct to consumer. Within each channel, we sell our products through a variety of physical points of sale, distributors, and e-commerce channels. In the direct to consumer channel, we had 125 Company-owned stores as of the end of fiscal 2021 and an extensive collection of products available through our owned websites. As of the end of fiscal 2021, net sales in the Europe segment accounted for 32.6% of our consolidated revenue.\nAsia: The Asia segment is comprised of sales to customers based in Australia, China (including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan), India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand. Sales are generated through diversified distribution channels that include wholesalers, distributors and direct to consumer. Within each channel, we sell our products through a variety of physical points of sale, distributors, and e-commerce channels. In the direct to consumer channel, we had 83 Company-owned stores as of the end of fiscal 2021 and an extensive collection of products available through our owned websites. As of the end of fiscal 2021, net sales in the Asia segment accounted for 24.4% of our consolidated revenue.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to product returns, bad debt, inventories, long-lived asset impairment, impairment of trade names, income taxes, warranty costs and litigation liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting subjects require the most significant estimates and judgments.\nProduct Returns. We monitor customer returns and maintain a provision for estimated returns based upon historical experience, current information and any specific issues identified. While returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, future return rates may differ from those experienced in the past. In the event that our products are performing poorly in the retail market and/or we experience product damages or defects at a rate significantly higher than our historical rate, the resulting returns could have an adverse impact on the operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur. If our allowance for product returns were to change by 10%, the impact, excluding taxes, would have been an approximate $2.1 million change to net income (loss).\nInventories. We account for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the average cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about forecasted sales demand, market conditions and available liquidation channels. Valuation of existing smartwatch inventory can be negatively impacted by the emergence of newer generation product. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, or if liquidation channels are not readily available, additional inventory valuation reductions may be required. We assess our off-price sales on an ongoing basis and update our estimates accordingly. For every 1% of additional inventory valuation reductions as of fiscal year end 2021, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $0.2 million.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Lease Impairment. We test for asset impairment of property, plant and equipment and lease assets whenever events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows related to the asset. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, we calculate fair value using our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. When undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated through the operations of our Company-owned retail stores are less than the carrying value of the underlying assets, the assets are impaired. If it is determined that assets are impaired, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the asset's book value exceeds its fair value. Should actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated, additional losses may be recorded. We recorded impairment losses in other long-lived asset impairments of $7.5 million, $27.3 million and $7.9 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to lease assets. We recorded impairment losses in other long-lived asset impairments of $1.7 million, $4.0 million and $0.7 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to property, plant and equipment. We recorded impairment losses in restructuring charges of $0.7 million, $2.9 million and $1.7 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to lease assets. We recorded impairment losses in restructuring charges of $0.2 million, $1.1 million and $0.6 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to property, plant and equipment. In fiscal year 2021, an increase of 100 basis points to the discount rate would not have resulted in an increase to property, plant and equipment and lease impairment expense. A 10% decrease in future expected cash flows would have increased impairment expense by $1.1 million.\nIncome Taxes. We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (\"ASC 740\"). Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made. The valuation allowance for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $123.0 million, $109.3 million and $118.1 million, respectively.\nOur continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. We accrue an amount for our estimate of additional income tax liability which we believe we are more likely than not to incur as a result of the ultimate resolution of tax audits (\"uncertain tax positions\"). We review and update the estimates used in the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities upon completion of tax audits, expiration of statutes of limitation, or occurrence of other events. The results of operations and financial position for future periods could be impacted by changes in assumptions or resolutions of tax audits.\nThe GILTI provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"TCJ Act\u201d) requiring the inclusion of certain foreign earnings in U.S. taxable income will continue to have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate. The GILTI impact will be accounted for as incurred under the period cost method. In addition, our valuation allowance analysis is affected by various aspects of the TCJ Act, including the limitation on the deductibility of interest expense and the impact of the GILTI. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d) which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, allowed a carryback of the Company's net operating losses for fiscal years 2019 and 2020. Valuation allowances in the amount of $23.1 million related to these loss carrybacks were released in fiscal year 2020.\nKey Measures of Financial Performance and Key Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nConstant Currency Financial Information: As a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The translation of the operations of our foreign-based entities from their local currencies into U.S. dollars is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and can have a significant impact on our reported financial results. In general, our overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business.\nAs a result, in addition to presenting financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), our discussion contains references to constant currency financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. To calculate net sales on a constant currency basis, net sales for the current fiscal year for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average rates during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. We present constant currency information to provide investors with a basis to evaluate how our underlying business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The constant currency financial information presented herein should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between constant currency financial information and the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included where applicable.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted operating income (loss), Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures. We define Adjusted EBITDA as our income (loss) before income taxes, plus interest expense, amortization and depreciation, impairment expense, other non-cash charges, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring expense and unamortized debt issuance costs included in loss on extinguishment of debt minus interest income. We define Adjusted operating income (loss) as operating income (loss) before impairment expense and restructuring expense. We define Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share as net income attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. and diluted earnings per share, respectively, before impairment expense, restructuring expense and unamortized debt issuance costs included in loss on extinguishment of debt. We have included Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted operating income (loss), Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share herein because they are widely used by investors for valuation and for comparing our financial performance with the performance of our competitors. We also use these non-GAAP financial measures to monitor and compare the financial performance of our operations. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted operating income (loss), Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures other companies report. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted operating income (loss), Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share are not intended to be used as alternatives to any measure of our performance in accordance with GAAP.\nDigital Sales: Due to shifting consumer traffic patterns and digital buying trends, we continue to accelerate our investments and capabilities in our global digital platform, and digital sales provide an important metric for our company. The digital space provides unique ways of engaging our customers. Digital sales include sales on our own e-commerce sites, global third party platforms, and wholesale dot com sites.\nComparable Retail Sales: Both stores and e-commerce sites are included in comparable retail sales in the thirteenth month of operation. Stores that experience a gross square footage increase of 10% or more due to an expansion and/or relocation are removed from the comparable store sales base, but are included in total sales. These stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month following the expansion and/or relocation. Comparable retail sales were adjusted to normalize the 52-week fiscal year 2021 with the 53-week fiscal year 2020. Comparable retail sales also exclude the effects of foreign currency fluctuations.\nStore Counts: While macro economic factors have shifted sales away from traditional brick and mortar stores towards digital channels, store counts continue to provide a key metric for management. Over time, we have made progress right-sizing our fleet of stores, focusing on closing our least profitable stores, and the size and quality of our store fleet have a direct impact on our sales and profitability.\nTotal Liquidity: We define Total liquidity as cash and cash equivalents plus available borrowings on our revolving credit facility. We monitor and forecast Total liquidity to ensure we can meet our financial obligations.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenues from sales of our products, including those that are subject to inventory consignment agreements, are recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer and in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for the product. We accept limited returns from customers. We continually monitor returns and maintain a provision for estimated returns based upon historical experience and any specific issues identified. Product returns are accounted for as reductions to revenue and cost of sales and increases to customer liabilities and other current assets to the extent the returned product is resalable.\nCost of Sales includes raw material costs, assembly labor, assembly overhead including depreciation expense, assembly warehousing costs and shipping and handling costs related to the movement of finished goods from assembly locations to sales distribution centers and from sales distribution centers to customer locations. Additionally, cost of sales includes customs duties, product packaging cost, royalty cost associated with sales of licensed products, the cost of molding and tooling and inventory shrinkage and damages.\nGross Profit and gross profit margin are influenced by our diversified business model that includes, but is not limited to: (i) product categories that we distribute; (ii) the multiple brands, including both owned and licensed, we offer within several product categories; (iii) the geographical presence of our businesses; and (iv) the different distribution channels we sell to or through.\nThe attributes of this diversified business model produce varying ranges of gross profit margin. Generally, on a historical basis, our fashion branded traditional watch and jewelry offerings produce higher gross profit margins than our smartwatches and leather goods offerings. In addition, in most product categories that we offer, brands with higher retail price points generally produce higher gross profit margins compared to those of lower retail priced brands. However, smartwatches carry relatively lower margins than our other major product categories. Gross profit margins related to sales in our Europe and Asia businesses are historically higher than our Americas business, primarily due to the following factors: (i) premiums charged in comparison to retail prices on products sold in the U.S.; (ii) the product sales mix in our international businesses, in comparison to our Americas business, is comprised more predominantly of watches and jewelry that generally produce higher gross profit margins than leather goods; and (iii) the watch sales mix in our Europe and Asia businesses, in comparison to our Americas business, are comprised more predominantly of higher priced licensed brands.\nOperating Expenses include selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\"), trade name impairments, other long-lived asset impairments and restructuring charges. SG&A expenses include selling and distribution expenses primarily consisting of sales and distribution labor costs, sales distribution center and warehouse facility costs, depreciation expense related to sales distribution and warehouse facilities, the four-wall operating costs of our retail stores, point-of-sale expenses, advertising expenses and art, design and product development labor costs. SG&A also includes general and administrative expenses primarily consisting of administrative support labor and support costs such as treasury, legal, information services, accounting, internal audit, human resources, executive management costs and costs associated with stock-based compensation. Restructuring charges include costs to reorganize, refine and optimize our Company's infrastructure and store closures under our New World Fossil initiatives.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020\nConsolidated Net Sales. Net sales increased $256.7 million or 15.9% (13.8% in constant currency) for fiscal year 2021, as compared to fiscal year 2020. We experienced sales increases in all three geographic segments and in the watches and jewelry product categories, while leathers decreased. In watches, strong sales growth in traditional watches was partially offset with sales declines in smartwatches, due to fewer smartwatch liquidations in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, and as a result of certain of our brands exiting the smartwatch category. In fiscal year 2021, digital sales, which include sales from our owned e-commerce channels, third party e-commerce platforms and wholesale dot com, were 41% of worldwide net sales. Digital sales increased 23% (20% in constant currency) in fiscal year 2021, compared to fiscal year 2020. Comparable retail sales increased 3.2% on a 52-week calendar basis during fiscal year 2021.\nThe following table sets forth consolidated net sales by segment and the changes in net sales by segment on

Americas net sales increased $143.7 million or 22.4% (21.4% in constant currency) for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 with strong sales increases in the U.S. and Mexico and a slight decrease in Canada. Traditional watch sales increased while smartwatches net sales were flat. Within the smartwatch category, sales growth in current generation product was offset by reduced levels of smartwatch liquidation of older generation product in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, and as a result of certain of our brands exiting the smartwatch category. Sales increased in multiple brands during fiscal year 2021, most notably in MICHAEL KORS\u00ae and FOSSIL\u00ae. Strong sales growth in our wholesale, retail stores and third party e-commerce channels more than offset a sales decrease in our owned e-commerce channel. Comparable retail sales increased moderately on a 52-week calendar basis during fiscal year 2021, with strong growth in our retail stores partially offset by a moderate decline in e-commerce net sales.\nThe following table sets forth product net sales and the changes in product net sales on both a reported and constant currency basis from period to period for the Americas segment (dollars in millions):\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Net Sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td>Growth (Decline) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage as Reported </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Constant Currency </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Watches: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Traditional watches </td> <td>$531.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>$403.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>$128.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>31.8% </td> <td> </td> <td>30.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Smartwatches </td> <td>110.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>110.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total watches </td> <td>$642.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>$514.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>$128.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>24.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>24.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leathers </td> <td>95.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>104.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.4) </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.0) </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Jewelry </td> <td>41.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>17.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>24.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>139.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>137.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>7.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>14.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>17.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$785.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>$642.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>$143.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>22.4% </td> <td> </td> <td>21.4% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEurope Net Sales. During fiscal year 2021, Europe net sales increased $87.8 million or 16.8% (14.2% in constant currency) in comparison to fiscal year 2020. Our sales growth in traditional watches was partially offset by sales declines in smartwatches, due to fewer smartwatch liquidations of older generation product in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, and as a result of certain of our brands exiting the smartwatch category. During fiscal year 2021, sales increased in most major brands, most notably in MICHAEL KORS and FOSSIL. Strong growth in our third party e-commerce and wholesale channels more than offset a moderate decline in comparable retail sales on a 52-week calendar basis during fiscal year 2021 driven by traffic declines primarily due to COVID-19 restrictions in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nThe following table sets forth product net sales and the changes in product net sales on both a reported and constant currency basis from period to period for the Europe segment (dollars in millions):\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Net Sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td>Growth (Decline) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage as Reported </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Constant Currency </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Watches: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Traditional watches </td> <td>$ </td> <td>396.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>317.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>22.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Smartwatches </td> <td>74.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total watches </td> <td>$ </td> <td>471.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>404.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leathers </td> <td>31.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Jewelry </td> <td>96.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>610.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>522.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsia Net Sales. In fiscal year 2021, Asia net sales increased $20.9 million or 4.8% (1.7% in constant currency) in comparison to fiscal 2020. Our sales growth in traditional watches was partially offset by sales declines in smartwatches, due to fewer smartwatch liquidations of older generation product in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, and as a result of certain of our brands exiting the smartwatch category. EMPORIO ARMANI\u00ae, ARMANI EXCHANGE\u00ae and MICHAEL KORS saw moderate sales growth while most other brands declined or remained flat for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020. While we saw strong e-commerce sales growth for the full fiscal year 2021, sales slowed in the back half of the year as consumers shifted from traditional e-commerce platforms to social commerce. E-commerce growth was partially offset by significant retail stores declines, as a result of decreased traffic and temporary store closures, and a slight decline in the wholesale channel, negatively impacted by travel retail restrictions. Comparable retail sales decreased moderately on a 52-week calendar basis with a decline in retail stores partially offset by slight growth in our owned e-commerce for fiscal year 2021. Within the region, we had strong sales growth in fiscal year 2021 in India and Hong Kong, China and moderate sales growth in mainland China where sales declined in the back half of the year as compared to fiscal year 2020. Sales declined in the other major markets for fiscal year 2021.\nThe following table sets forth product net sales and the changes in product net sales on both a reported and constant currency basis from period to period for the Asia segment (dollars in millions):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Net Sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td>Growth (Decline) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage as Reported </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Constant Currency </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Watches: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Traditional watches </td> <td>$ </td> <td>359.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>337.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Smartwatches </td> <td>38.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total watches </td> <td>$ </td> <td>397.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>388.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leathers </td> <td>30.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Jewelry </td> <td>21.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>182.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>170.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>455.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>434.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit. Gross profit of $966.4 million in fiscal year 2021 increased $196.1 million, or 25.5%, in comparison to $770.4 million in fiscal year 2020 driven by the increase in sales. Gross profit margin rate increased to 51.7% in fiscal year 2021 compared to 47.7% in fiscal year 2020. The gross margin improvement primarily reflects decreased liquidation and inventory valuation adjustments of older generation smartwatch products (which most heavily impacted the first quarter of fiscal year 2020), favorable currency changes and decreased promotional activity. Additionally, the gross profit margin rate was favorably impacted by reduced tariffs and reduced levels of minimum licensed product royalties, partially offset by increased freight costs and unfavorable regional and product mix.\nOperating Expenses. For fiscal year 2021, total operating expenses decreased to $873.7 million or 46.7% of net sales, compared to $905.7 million or 56.1% of net sales in fiscal year 2020. SG&A expenses were $842.6 million in fiscal year 2021 compared to $835.1 million in fiscal year 2020. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 45.1% in fiscal year 2021 as compared to 51.8% in fiscal year 2020, mainly driven by the contraction of sales in fiscal year 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and cost reductions driven by New World Fossil initiatives. During fiscal year 2021, we incurred restructuring costs of $21.9 million compared to restructuring costs of $36.5 million in fiscal year 2020. We incurred $9.2 million of other long-lived asset impairment charges and no non-cash intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal year 2021 compared to charges of $31.6 million and $2.5 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2020. The translation of foreign-denominated expenses during fiscal year 2021 increased operating expenses by approximately $13.8 million as a result of the weaker U.S. dollar.\nOperating Income (Loss). Operating income (loss) was income of $92.6 million in fiscal year 2021, as compared to a loss of $135.3 million in the prior fiscal year. The improvement in operating income (loss) primarily resulted from the $256.7 million increase in net sales during fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020, which was significantly impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and improved margin rate. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin was 5.0% in fiscal year 2021 as compared to (8.4)% in fiscal year 2020 and was positively impacted by 150 basis points due to changes in foreign currencies.\nOperating income (loss) by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td>Growth (Decline) </td> <td> </td> <td>Operating Margin % </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas </td> <td>$ </td> <td>157.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>123.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>374.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>20.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe </td> <td>110.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>333.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia </td> <td>70.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate </td> <td>(245.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(258.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(135.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>227.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(168.4) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased by $6.7 million in fiscal year 2021 primarily driven by a lower debt balance.\nOther Income (Expense)-Net. During fiscal year 2021, other income (expense) - net was expense of $14.5 million, including a $13.0 million loss on the extinguishment of debt, compared to expense of $4.8 million the prior fiscal year.\nProvision for Income Taxes. During fiscal year 2021, there was an income tax expense of $26.4 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 49.8%, compared to 44.2% in fiscal year 2020. The 2021 effective rate was unfavorably impacted by valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and the impact of GILTI whereas the 2020 effective rate benefited from the net operating loss carryback provision of the CARES Act that allowed the Company to recognize the benefit of the 2019 and 2020 U.S. tax losses since these losses were carried back to prior tax years resulting in tax refunds. Valuation allowances were released in 2020 related to these carrybacks.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. Fiscal year 2021 net income (loss) attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. was net income of $25.4 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, in comparison to a net loss of $96.1 million, or $1.88 per diluted share, in the prior fiscal year. The year-over-year improvement was mainly driven by increased sales due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior fiscal year and improved margin rate. Fiscal year 2021 included restructuring charges of $0.33 per diluted share and no non-cash intangible asset impairment charges. In comparison, fiscal year 2020 included restructuring charges of $0.56 per diluted share and non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $0.04 per diluted share.

Generally, starting in the third quarter, our cash needs begin to increase, typically reaching a peak in the September-November time frame as we increase inventory levels in advance of the holiday season. Our quarterly cash requirements are also impacted by debt repayments, restructuring charges, strategic investments such as acquisitions, share repurchases and other capital expenditures.\nAt the end of fiscal year 2021, we had working capital of $487.1 million compared to working capital of $431.9 million at the end of the prior fiscal year. At the end of fiscal year 2021, we had $0.6 million of outstanding short-term borrowings and $141.4 million in long-term debt.\nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities is net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to increased inventory purchases and was partially offset by improvement in net income (loss).\nAccounts payable increased by 29.0% to $229.9 million at the end of fiscal year 2021 compared to $178.2 million at the end of the prior fiscal year.\nInventory at the end of fiscal year 2021 was $346.9 million, representing an increase of 17.5% from the prior fiscal year inventory balance of $295.3 million.\nAccounts receivable, net of allowances, increased by 11.0% to $255.1 million at the end of fiscal year 2021 compared to $229.8 million at the end of the prior fiscal year, primary driven by an increase in sales.\nInvesting Activities. Investing cash flows primarily consist of capital expenditures and are offset by proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. The increase in investing activities in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to the sale of a foreign office for $10.7 million during fiscal year 2021.\nFinancing Activities. Financing cash flows primarily consist of borrowings and repayments of debt. The decrease in financing cash flows in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was reflective of our pay down of debt.\nMaterial Cash Requirements. We have obligations as part of our ordinary course of business. Our material cash requirements include: (1) operating lease obligations (see Note 13 Leases within the Consolidated Financial Statements); (2) debt repayments (see Note 10 Debt within the Consolidated Financial Statements); (3) non-cancellable purchase obligations (see Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements), (4) minimum royalty payments (see Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements); and (5) employee wages, benefits, and incentives. The expected timing of payments of our obligations is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. In addition, some of our purchasing requirements are not current obligations and are therefore not included above. For example, some of these requirements are not handled through binding contracts or are fulfilled by vendors on a purchase order basis within short time horizons. Moreover, we may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions (see Note 12 Taxes within the Consolidated Financial Statements), pensions (see Note 16 Employee Benefit Plans within the Consolidate Financial Statements) and other matters.\nBecause of our opportunities for profitable growth from marketing, we are strategically increasing our marketing spending. In fiscal year 2021, total marketing expenses were $168.4 million, representing 9.0% of total net sales for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $126.3 million in fiscal year 2020, which represented 7.8% of total net sales, a year-over-year increase of 33.3%.\nFor the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, we expect total capital expenditures to be between approximately $20 million to $25 million. Our capital expenditure budget is an estimate and is subject to change.\nSources of Liquidity. We believe cash flows from operations, combined with existing cash on hand and amounts available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the foreseeable future. Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity in the short-term and long-term, the success of our operations, in light of the market volatility and uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, among other factors, could impact our business and liquidity. In the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our spending or sell assets or equity or debt securities.\nThe following table shows our sources of liquidity (in millions):\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>316.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolver availability </td> <td> </td> <td>199.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liquidity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>450.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>358.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNotes: In November of 2021, we sold $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes, generating net proceeds of approximately $141.7 million. On November 8, 2021, we used the majority of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes offering to repay the $122.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement. In connection with the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement, we incurred prepayment fees and accrued interest costs of $2.6 million. The remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.\nThe Senior Notes are our general unsecured obligations. The Senior Notes bear interest at the rate of 7.00% per annum. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30 of each year, commencing on February 28, 2022. The Senior Notes will mature on November 30, 2026. We may redeem the Senior Notes for cash in whole or in part at any time at our option. Prior to November 30, 2023, the redemption price will be $25.00 per $25.00 principal amount of Senior Notes, plus a \"make-whole\u201d premium plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. On and after November 30, 2023, we may redeem the Senior Notes (i) on or after November 30, 2023 and prior to November 30, 2024, at a price equal to $25.50 per $25.00 principal amount of Senior Notes, (ii) on or after November 30, 2024 and prior to November 30, 2025, at a price equal to $25.25 per $25.00 principal amount of Senior Notes and (iii) on or after November 30, 2025, at a price equal to $25.00 per $25.00 principal amount of Senior Notes, plus (in each case noted above) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.\nTerm Credit Agreement: On February 20, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to that certain Term Credit Agreement, dated as of September 26, 2019, by and among us, as borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders (the \"Term Credit Agreement Lenders\u201d) party thereto (as amended to date, the \"Term Credit Agreement\u201d). On May 12, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Term Credit Agreement to extend the deadline for delivery of our unaudited quarterly financial statements and related deliverables for the fiscal quarter ended April 4, 2020. On June 5, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 3 (the \"Third Amendment\u201d) to the Term Credit Agreement to further modify certain terms of the Term Credit Agreement to address the financial impact of COVID-19. On November 8, 2021, we used the majority of the net proceeds from the Notes Offering to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement. In connection with the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement, we incurred prepayment fees and accrued interest costs of $2.6 million and wrote off $7.1 million of debt issuance costs and $4.6 million of original issuance discount related to the Term Credit Agreement.\nRevolving Facility: On September 26, 2019, we and Fossil Partners L.P., as the U.S. borrowers, and Fossil Group Europe GmbH, Fossil Asia Pacific Limited, Fossil (Europe) GmbH, Fossil (UK) Limited and Fossil Canada Inc., as the non-U.S. borrowers, certain other of our subsidiaries from time to time party thereto designated as borrowers, and certain of our subsidiaries from time to time party thereto as guarantors, entered into a secured asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the \"Revolving Facility\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent (the \"ABL Agent\"), J.P. Morgan AG, as French collateral agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Citizens Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers, and Citizens Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-syndication agents and each of the lenders from time to time party thereto (the \"ABL Lenders\").\nThe Revolving Facility provides that the ABL Lenders may extend revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $225.0 million at any time outstanding (the Revolving Credit Commitment\u201d), of which up to $125.0 million is available under a U.S. facility, an aggregate of $70.0 million is available under a European facility, $20.0 million is available under a Hong Kong facility, $5.0 million is available under a French facility, and $5.0 million is available under a Canadian facility, in each case, subject to the borrowing base availability limitations described below. The Revolving Facility also includes an up to $45.0 million subfacility for the issuance of letters of credit (the Letters of Credit\u201d). The Revolving Facility expires and is due and payable on September 26, 2024. The French facility includes a $1.0 million subfacility for swingline loans, and the European facility includes a $7.0 million subfacility for swingline loans. The Revolving Facility is subject to a line cap (the Line Cap\u201d) equal to the lesser of the total Revolving Credit Commitment and the aggregate borrowing bases under the U.S. facility, the European facility, the Hong Kong facility, the French facility and the Canadian facility. Loans under the Revolving Facility may be made in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euros, Hong Kong dollars or pounds sterling.\nThe Revolving Facility is an asset-based facility, in which borrowing availability is subject to a borrowing base equal to: (a) with respect to us, the sum of (i) the lesser of (x) 90% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible U.S. finished goods inventory and (y) 65% of the lower of cost or market value of eligible U.S. finished goods inventory, plus (ii) 85% of the eligible U.S. accounts receivable, plus (iii) 90% of eligible U.S. credit card accounts receivable, minus (iv) the aggregate amount of reserves, if any, established by the ABL Agent; (b) with respect to each non-U.S. borrower (except for the French Borrower), the sum of (i) the lesser of (x) 90% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible foreign finished goods inventory of such non-U.S. borrower and (y) 65% of the lower of cost or market value of eligible foreign finished goods inventory of such non-U.S. borrower, plus (ii) 85% of the eligible foreign accounts receivable of such non-U.S. borrower, minus (iii) the aggregate amount of reserves, if any, established by the ABL Agent; and (c) with respect to the French Borrower, (i) 85% of eligible French accounts receivable minus (ii) the aggregate amount of reserves, if any, established by the ABL Agent. Not more than 60% of the aggregate borrowing base under the Revolving Facility may consist of the non-U.S. borrowing bases.\nFiscal Year 2021 Activity: During fiscal year 2021, we had net borrowings of $150.0 million under the Senior Notes at an average annual interest rate of 7.0%. We had net repayments of $152.0 million under the Term Credit Agreement during fiscal year 2021 at an average interest rate of 10.1%. We had net repayments of $96.1 million under the Revolving Facility during fiscal year 2021 at an average interest rate of 1.5%. As of January 1, 2022, we had $150.0 million outstanding under the Senior Notes and no balance outstanding under the Revolving Facility. As of January 1, 2022, we had unamortized debt issuance costs of $8.7 million which reduces the corresponding debt liability. In addition, we had $4.7 million of outstanding standby letters of credit at January 1, 2022. Amounts available under the Revolving Facility are reduced by any amounts outstanding under standby letters of credit. As of January 1, 2022, we had $199.7 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Facility. At January 1, 2022, we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our debt agreement.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Business, Item 1A. Risk Factors and our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results of operations may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those included in Item 1A. Risk Factors and other portions of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a global design, marketing and distribution company that specializes in consumer fashion accessories. Our principal offerings include an extensive line of men's and women's fashion watches and jewelry, handbags, small leather goods, belts, and sunglasses. In the watch and jewelry product categories, we have a diverse portfolio of globally recognized owned and licensed brand names under which our products are marketed.\nOur products are distributed globally through various distribution channels including wholesale in countries where we have a physical presence, direct to the consumer through our retail stores and commercial websites and through third-party distributors in countries where we do not maintain a physical presence. Our products are offered at varying price points to meet the needs of our customers, whether they are value-conscious or luxury oriented. Based on our range of accessory products, brands, distribution channels and price points, we are able to target style-conscious consumers across a wide age spectrum on a global basis.\nKnown or Anticipated Trends\nBased on our recent operating results and current perspectives on our operating environment, we anticipate the following trends will continue to impact our operating results:\nCOVID-19: Our business operations and financial performance continue to be materially impacted by COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the global economies, disrupted global supply chains and financial markets, and led to significant travel and transportation restrictions, including periodic mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and orders to shelter-in-place. We remain focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees, customers and suppliers to minimize potential disruptions and supporting the community to address challenges posed by the global COVID-19 pandemic. The total impact of the pandemic on our business is uncertain and depends in part on future developments including the duration and spread of COVID-19, the availability and acceptance of vaccines and continuing actions taken by governmental authorities to control the outbreak and mitigate its impact, including effects of any vaccine mandates, restrictions on movement and commercial activities and further stimulus and unemployment benefits.\nSupply Chain: Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing supply. We rely on domestic and foreign suppliers to provide us with merchandise in a timely manner and at favorable prices. Certain key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, which exposes us to potential supply shortages that could disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products. Any interruption or delay in the supply of key components could significantly harm our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and cause us to lose sales. Among our foreign suppliers, China is the source of a substantial majority of our imports. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, increased international transit times, particularly for our leathers products and packaging, and increased shipping costs for a majority of our products. A disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise from China or a material increase in the cost of those goods or transportation without any offsetting price increases may significantly decrease our profits.\nData Security: We depend on information technology systems, the Internet and computer networks for a substantial portion of our retail and e-commerce businesses, including credit card transaction authorization and processing. We also receive and store personal information about our customers and employees, the protection of which is critical to us. In the normal course of our business, we collect, retain, and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information, over public networks. Despite the security measures we currently have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers have been, and will continue to be, vulnerable to theft of physical information, security breaches, hacking attempts, computer viruses and malware, ransomware, phishing, lost data and programming and/or human errors. To date, none of these risks, intrusions, attacks or human error have resulted in any material liability to us. While we carry insurance policies that would provide liability coverage for certain of these matters, if we experience a significant security incident, we could be subject to liability or other damages that exceed our insurance coverage, and we cannot be certain that such insurance policies will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\nBusiness Strategies and Outlook: Notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic, we plan to execute the following strategies to enhance our brands, grow our revenue and improve profitability. The first strategic initiative is to increase brand excitement by crafting compelling stories that build upon brand equities for both owned and licensed brands across our product categories. Key to this strategy is our ongoing effort in innovation in our product categories and marketing capabilities, where we aim to build larger communities of brand loyalists. Our second strategic initiative is to increase digital engagement and online sales. We continue to invest in our owned e-commerce sites around the world and in third party marketplaces to enhance our direct to consumer engagement, which we believe can build long-term customer value. Our third strategic initiative is to optimize our operations. We initiated the New World Fossil - Transform to Grow (\"NWF 2.0\u201d) initiative in 2019 aimed to further simplify our operations and to reallocate resources toward growth, and we achieved our $250 million run-rate savings goal in 2021. Although we are nearing completion of our NWF 2.0 program, we will continue to optimize our operations with further reductions to our store footprint and increased focus on inventory management and supply chain efficiency. Our fourth strategic initiative is to expand our opportunity in mainland China and India. In these countries, we are continuing to execute against a strategy centered around localized marketing and segmented assortments. Although the impact of COVID-19 is likely to disrupt our growth trajectory in the short to intermediate term, we continue to view mainland China and India as compelling long-term opportunities.\nNotes Offering: In November 2021, we sold $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.00% Senior Notes due 2026. We used the majority of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes offering to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement (as defined below). In connection with the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement, we incurred prepayment fees and accrued interest costs of $2.6 million and wrote off $7.1 million of debt issuance costs and $4.6 million of original issuance discount related to the Term Credit Agreement. The remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes\nOperating Segments\nWe operate our business in three segments which are divided into geographies. Net sales for each geographic segment are based on the location of the selling entity and each reportable segment provides similar products and services.\nAmericas: The Americas segment is comprised of sales from our operations in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Sales are generated through diversified distribution channels that include wholesalers, distributors, and direct to consumer. Within each channel, we sell our products through a variety of physical point of sale, distributors and e-commerce channels. In the direct to consumer channel, we had 162 Company-owned stores as of the end of fiscal 2021 and an extensive collection of products available through our owned websites. As of the end of fiscal 2021, net sales in the Americas segment accounted for 42.0% of our consolidated revenue.\nEurope: The Europe segment is comprised of sales to customers based in European countries, the Middle East and Africa. Sales are generated through diversified distribution channels that include wholesalers, distributors and direct to consumer. Within each channel, we sell our products through a variety of physical points of sale, distributors, and e-commerce channels. In the direct to consumer channel, we had 125 Company-owned stores as of the end of fiscal 2021 and an extensive collection of products available through our owned websites. As of the end of fiscal 2021, net sales in the Europe segment accounted for 32.6% of our consolidated revenue.\nAsia: The Asia segment is comprised of sales to customers based in Australia, China (including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan), India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand. Sales are generated through diversified distribution channels that include wholesalers, distributors and direct to consumer. Within each channel, we sell our products through a variety of physical points of sale, distributors, and e-commerce channels. In the direct to consumer channel, we had 83 Company-owned stores as of the end of fiscal 2021 and an extensive collection of products available through our owned websites. As of the end of fiscal 2021, net sales in the Asia segment accounted for 24.4% of our consolidated revenue.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to product returns, bad debt, inventories, long-lived asset impairment, impairment of trade names, income taxes, warranty costs and litigation liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting subjects require the most significant estimates and judgments.\nProduct Returns. We monitor customer returns and maintain a provision for estimated returns based upon historical experience, current information and any specific issues identified. While returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, future return rates may differ from those experienced in the past. In the event that our products are performing poorly in the retail market and/or we experience product damages or defects at a rate significantly higher than our historical rate, the resulting returns could have an adverse impact on the operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur. If our allowance for product returns were to change by 10%, the impact, excluding taxes, would have been an approximate $2.1 million change to net income (loss).\nInventories. We account for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the average cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about forecasted sales demand, market conditions and available liquidation channels. Valuation of existing smartwatch inventory can be negatively impacted by the emergence of newer generation product. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, or if liquidation channels are not readily available, additional inventory valuation reductions may be required. We assess our off-price sales on an ongoing basis and update our estimates accordingly. For every 1% of additional inventory valuation reductions as of fiscal year end 2021, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $0.2 million.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Lease Impairment. We test for asset impairment of property, plant and equipment and lease assets whenever events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows related to the asset. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, we calculate fair value using our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. When undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated through the operations of our Company-owned retail stores are less than the carrying value of the underlying assets, the assets are impaired. If it is determined that assets are impaired, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the asset's book value exceeds its fair value. Should actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated, additional losses may be recorded. We recorded impairment losses in other long-lived asset impairments of $7.5 million, $27.3 million and $7.9 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to lease assets. We recorded impairment losses in other long-lived asset impairments of $1.7 million, $4.0 million and $0.7 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to property, plant and equipment. We recorded impairment losses in restructuring charges of $0.7 million, $2.9 million and $1.7 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to lease assets. We recorded impairment losses in restructuring charges of $0.2 million, $1.1 million and $0.6 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to property, plant and equipment. In fiscal year 2021, an increase of 100 basis points to the discount rate would not have resulted in an increase to property, plant and equipment and lease impairment expense. A 10% decrease in future expected cash flows would have increased impairment expense by $1.1 million.\nIncome Taxes. We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (\"ASC 740\"). Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made. The valuation allowance for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $123.0 million, $109.3 million and $118.1 million, respectively.\nOur continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. We accrue an amount for our estimate of additional income tax liability which we believe we are more likely than not to incur as a result of the ultimate resolution of tax audits (\"uncertain tax positions\"). We review and update the estimates used in the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities upon completion of tax audits, expiration of statutes of limitation, or occurrence of other events. The results of operations and financial position for future periods could be impacted by changes in assumptions or resolutions of tax audits.\nThe GILTI provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"TCJ Act\u201d) requiring the inclusion of certain foreign earnings in U.S. taxable income will continue to have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate. The GILTI impact will be accounted for as incurred under the period cost method. In addition, our valuation allowance analysis is affected by various aspects of the TCJ Act, including the limitation on the deductibility of interest expense and the impact of the GILTI. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d) which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, allowed a carryback of the Company's net operating losses for fiscal years 2019 and 2020. Valuation allowances in the amount of $23.1 million related to these loss carrybacks were released in fiscal year 2020.\nKey Measures of Financial Performance and Key Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nConstant Currency Financial Information: As a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The translation of the operations of our foreign-based entities from their local currencies into U.S. dollars is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and can have a significant impact on our reported financial results. In general, our overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business.\nAs a result, in addition to presenting financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), our discussion contains references to constant currency financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. To calculate net sales on a constant currency basis, net sales for the current fiscal year for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average rates during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. We present constant currency information to provide investors with a basis to evaluate how our underlying business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The constant currency financial information presented herein should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between constant currency financial information and the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included where applicable.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted operating income (loss), Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures. We define Adjusted EBITDA as our income (loss) before income taxes, plus interest expense, amortization and depreciation, impairment expense, other non-cash charges, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring expense and unamortized debt issuance costs included in loss on extinguishment of debt minus interest income. We define Adjusted operating income (loss) as operating income (loss) before impairment expense and restructuring expense. We define Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share as net income attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. and diluted earnings per share, respectively, before impairment expense, restructuring expense and unamortized debt issuance costs included in loss on extinguishment of debt. We have included Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted operating income (loss), Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share herein because they are widely used by investors for valuation and for comparing our financial performance with the performance of our competitors. We also use these non-GAAP financial measures to monitor and compare the financial performance of our operations. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted operating income (loss), Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures other companies report. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted operating income (loss), Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share are not intended to be used as alternatives to any measure of our performance in accordance with GAAP.\nDigital Sales: Due to shifting consumer traffic patterns and digital buying trends, we continue to accelerate our investments and capabilities in our global digital platform, and digital sales provide an important metric for our company. The digital space provides unique ways of engaging our customers. Digital sales include sales on our own e-commerce sites, global third party platforms, and wholesale dot com sites.\nComparable Retail Sales: Both stores and e-commerce sites are included in comparable retail sales in the thirteenth month of operation. Stores that experience a gross square footage increase of 10% or more due to an expansion and/or relocation are removed from the comparable store sales base, but are included in total sales. These stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month following the expansion and/or relocation. Comparable retail sales were adjusted to normalize the 52-week fiscal year 2021 with the 53-week fiscal year 2020. Comparable retail sales also exclude the effects of foreign currency fluctuations.\nStore Counts: While macro economic factors have shifted sales away from traditional brick and mortar stores towards digital channels, store counts continue to provide a key metric for management. Over time, we have made progress right-sizing our fleet of stores, focusing on closing our least profitable stores, and the size and quality of our store fleet have a direct impact on our sales and profitability.\nTotal Liquidity: We define Total liquidity as cash and cash equivalents plus available borrowings on our revolving credit facility. We monitor and forecast Total liquidity to ensure we can meet our financial obligations.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenues from sales of our products, including those that are subject to inventory consignment agreements, are recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer and in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for the product. We accept limited returns from customers. We continually monitor returns and maintain a provision for estimated returns based upon historical experience and any specific issues identified. Product returns are accounted for as reductions to revenue and cost of sales and increases to customer liabilities and other current assets to the extent the returned product is resalable.\nCost of Sales includes raw material costs, assembly labor, assembly overhead including depreciation expense, assembly warehousing costs and shipping and handling costs related to the movement of finished goods from assembly locations to sales distribution centers and from sales distribution centers to customer locations. Additionally, cost of sales includes customs duties, product packaging cost, royalty cost associated with sales of licensed products, the cost of molding and tooling and inventory shrinkage and damages.\nGross Profit and gross profit margin are influenced by our diversified business model that includes, but is not limited to: (i) product categories that we distribute; (ii) the multiple brands, including both owned and licensed, we offer within several product categories; (iii) the geographical presence of our businesses; and (iv) the different distribution channels we sell to or through.\nThe attributes of this diversified business model produce varying ranges of gross profit margin. Generally, on a historical basis, our fashion branded traditional watch and jewelry offerings produce higher gross profit margins than our smartwatches and leather goods offerings. In addition, in most product categories that we offer, brands with higher retail price points generally produce higher gross profit margins compared to those of lower retail priced brands. However, smartwatches carry relatively lower margins than our other major product categories. Gross profit margins related to sales in our Europe and Asia businesses are historically higher than our Americas business, primarily due to the following factors: (i) premiums charged in comparison to retail prices on products sold in the U.S.; (ii) the product sales mix in our international businesses, in comparison to our Americas business, is comprised more predominantly of watches and jewelry that generally produce higher gross profit margins than leather goods; and (iii) the watch sales mix in our Europe and Asia businesses, in comparison to our Americas business, are comprised more predominantly of higher priced licensed brands.\nOperating Expenses include selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\"), trade name impairments, other long-lived asset impairments and restructuring charges. SG&A expenses include selling and distribution expenses primarily consisting of sales and distribution labor costs, sales distribution center and warehouse facility costs, depreciation expense related to sales distribution and warehouse facilities, the four-wall operating costs of our retail stores, point-of-sale expenses, advertising expenses and art, design and product development labor costs. SG&A also includes general and administrative expenses primarily consisting of administrative support labor and support costs such as treasury, legal, information services, accounting, internal audit, human resources, executive management costs and costs associated with stock-based compensation. Restructuring charges include costs to reorganize, refine and optimize our Company's infrastructure and store closures under our New World Fossil initiatives.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020\nConsolidated Net Sales. Net sales increased $256.7 million or 15.9% (13.8% in constant currency) for fiscal year 2021, as compared to fiscal year 2020. We experienced sales increases in all three geographic segments and in the watches and jewelry product categories, while leathers decreased. In watches, strong sales growth in traditional watches was partially offset with sales declines in smartwatches, due to fewer smartwatch liquidations in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, and as a result of certain of our brands exiting the smartwatch category. In fiscal year 2021, digital sales, which include sales from our owned e-commerce channels, third party e-commerce platforms and wholesale dot com, were 41% of worldwide net sales. Digital sales increased 23% (20% in constant currency) in fiscal year 2021, compared to fiscal year 2020. Comparable retail sales increased 3.2% on a 52-week calendar basis during fiscal year 2021.\nThe following table sets forth consolidated net sales by segment and the changes in net sales by segment on

Americas net sales increased $143.7 million or 22.4% (21.4% in constant currency) for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 with strong sales increases in the U.S. and Mexico and a slight decrease in Canada. Traditional watch sales increased while smartwatches net sales were flat. Within the smartwatch category, sales growth in current generation product was offset by reduced levels of smartwatch liquidation of older generation product in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, and as a result of certain of our brands exiting the smartwatch category. Sales increased in multiple brands during fiscal year 2021, most notably in MICHAEL KORS\u00ae and FOSSIL\u00ae. Strong sales growth in our wholesale, retail stores and third party e-commerce channels more than offset a sales decrease in our owned e-commerce channel. Comparable retail sales increased moderately on a 52-week calendar basis during fiscal year 2021, with strong growth in our retail stores partially offset by a moderate decline in e-commerce net sales.\nThe following table sets forth product net sales and the changes in product net sales on both a reported and constant currency basis from period to period for the Americas segment (dollars in millions):\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Net Sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td>Growth (Decline) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage as Reported </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Constant Currency </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Watches: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Traditional watches </td> <td>$531.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>$403.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>$128.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>31.8% </td> <td> </td> <td>30.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Smartwatches </td> <td>110.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>110.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total watches </td> <td>$642.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>$514.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>$128.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>24.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>24.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leathers </td> <td>95.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>104.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.4) </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.0) </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Jewelry </td> <td>41.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>17.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>24.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>139.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>137.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>7.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>14.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>17.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$785.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>$642.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>$143.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>22.4% </td> <td> </td> <td>21.4% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEurope Net Sales. During fiscal year 2021, Europe net sales increased $87.8 million or 16.8% (14.2% in constant currency) in comparison to fiscal year 2020. Our sales growth in traditional watches was partially offset by sales declines in smartwatches, due to fewer smartwatch liquidations of older generation product in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, and as a result of certain of our brands exiting the smartwatch category. During fiscal year 2021, sales increased in most major brands, most notably in MICHAEL KORS and FOSSIL. Strong growth in our third party e-commerce and wholesale channels more than offset a moderate decline in comparable retail sales on a 52-week calendar basis during fiscal year 2021 driven by traffic declines primarily due to COVID-19 restrictions in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nThe following table sets forth product net sales and the changes in product net sales on both a reported and constant currency basis from period to period for the Europe segment (dollars in millions):\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Net Sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td>Growth (Decline) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage as Reported </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Constant Currency </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Watches: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Traditional watches </td> <td>$ </td> <td>396.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>317.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>22.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Smartwatches </td> <td>74.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total watches </td> <td>$ </td> <td>471.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>404.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leathers </td> <td>31.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Jewelry </td> <td>96.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>610.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>522.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsia Net Sales. In fiscal year 2021, Asia net sales increased $20.9 million or 4.8% (1.7% in constant currency) in comparison to fiscal 2020. Our sales growth in traditional watches was partially offset by sales declines in smartwatches, due to fewer smartwatch liquidations of older generation product in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, and as a result of certain of our brands exiting the smartwatch category. EMPORIO ARMANI\u00ae, ARMANI EXCHANGE\u00ae and MICHAEL KORS saw moderate sales growth while most other brands declined or remained flat for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020. While we saw strong e-commerce sales growth for the full fiscal year 2021, sales slowed in the back half of the year as consumers shifted from traditional e-commerce platforms to social commerce. E-commerce growth was partially offset by significant retail stores declines, as a result of decreased traffic and temporary store closures, and a slight decline in the wholesale channel, negatively impacted by travel retail restrictions. Comparable retail sales decreased moderately on a 52-week calendar basis with a decline in retail stores partially offset by slight growth in our owned e-commerce for fiscal year 2021. Within the region, we had strong sales growth in fiscal year 2021 in India and Hong Kong, China and moderate sales growth in mainland China where sales declined in the back half of the year as compared to fiscal year 2020. Sales declined in the other major markets for fiscal year 2021.\nThe following table sets forth product net sales and the changes in product net sales on both a reported and constant currency basis from period to period for the Asia segment (dollars in millions):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Net Sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td>Growth (Decline) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage as Reported </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Constant Currency </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Watches: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Traditional watches </td> <td>$ </td> <td>359.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>337.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Smartwatches </td> <td>38.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total watches </td> <td>$ </td> <td>397.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>388.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leathers </td> <td>30.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Jewelry </td> <td>21.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>182.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>170.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>455.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>434.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit. Gross profit of $966.4 million in fiscal year 2021 increased $196.1 million, or 25.5%, in comparison to $770.4 million in fiscal year 2020 driven by the increase in sales. Gross profit margin rate increased to 51.7% in fiscal year 2021 compared to 47.7% in fiscal year 2020. The gross margin improvement primarily reflects decreased liquidation and inventory valuation adjustments of older generation smartwatch products (which most heavily impacted the first quarter of fiscal year 2020), favorable currency changes and decreased promotional activity. Additionally, the gross profit margin rate was favorably impacted by reduced tariffs and reduced levels of minimum licensed product royalties, partially offset by increased freight costs and unfavorable regional and product mix.\nOperating Expenses. For fiscal year 2021, total operating expenses decreased to $873.7 million or 46.7% of net sales, compared to $905.7 million or 56.1% of net sales in fiscal year 2020. SG&A expenses were $842.6 million in fiscal year 2021 compared to $835.1 million in fiscal year 2020. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 45.1% in fiscal year 2021 as compared to 51.8% in fiscal year 2020, mainly driven by the contraction of sales in fiscal year 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and cost reductions driven by New World Fossil initiatives. During fiscal year 2021, we incurred restructuring costs of $21.9 million compared to restructuring costs of $36.5 million in fiscal year 2020. We incurred $9.2 million of other long-lived asset impairment charges and no non-cash intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal year 2021 compared to charges of $31.6 million and $2.5 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2020. The translation of foreign-denominated expenses during fiscal year 2021 increased operating expenses by approximately $13.8 million as a result of the weaker U.S. dollar.\nOperating Income (Loss). Operating income (loss) was income of $92.6 million in fiscal year 2021, as compared to a loss of $135.3 million in the prior fiscal year. The improvement in operating income (loss) primarily resulted from the $256.7 million increase in net sales during fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020, which was significantly impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and improved margin rate. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin was 5.0% in fiscal year 2021 as compared to (8.4)% in fiscal year 2020 and was positively impacted by 150 basis points due to changes in foreign currencies.\nOperating income (loss) by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td>Growth (Decline) </td> <td> </td> <td>Operating Margin % </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas </td> <td>$ </td> <td>157.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>123.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>374.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>20.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe </td> <td>110.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>333.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia </td> <td>70.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate </td> <td>(245.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(258.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(135.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>227.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(168.4) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased by $6.7 million in fiscal year 2021 primarily driven by a lower debt balance.\nOther Income (Expense)-Net. During fiscal year 2021, other income (expense) - net was expense of $14.5 million, including a $13.0 million loss on the extinguishment of debt, compared to expense of $4.8 million the prior fiscal year.\nProvision for Income Taxes. During fiscal year 2021, there was an income tax expense of $26.4 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 49.8%, compared to 44.2% in fiscal year 2020. The 2021 effective rate was unfavorably impacted by valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and the impact of GILTI whereas the 2020 effective rate benefited from the net operating loss carryback provision of the CARES Act that allowed the Company to recognize the benefit of the 2019 and 2020 U.S. tax losses since these losses were carried back to prior tax years resulting in tax refunds. Valuation allowances were released in 2020 related to these carrybacks.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. Fiscal year 2021 net income (loss) attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. was net income of $25.4 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, in comparison to a net loss of $96.1 million, or $1.88 per diluted share, in the prior fiscal year. The year-over-year improvement was mainly driven by increased sales due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior fiscal year and improved margin rate. Fiscal year 2021 included restructuring charges of $0.33 per diluted share and no non-cash intangible asset impairment charges. In comparison, fiscal year 2020 included restructuring charges of $0.56 per diluted share and non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $0.04 per diluted share. Currency fluctuations favorably impacted the year-over-year diluted earnings (loss) per share by $0.46.\nAdjusted EBITDA.

Generally, starting in the third quarter, our cash needs begin to increase, typically reaching a peak in the September-November time frame as we increase inventory levels in advance of the holiday season. Our quarterly cash requirements are also impacted by debt repayments, restructuring charges, strategic investments such as acquisitions, share repurchases and other capital expenditures.\nAt the end of fiscal year 2021, we had working capital of $487.1 million compared to working capital of $431.9 million at the end of the prior fiscal year. At the end of fiscal year 2021, we had $0.6 million of outstanding short-term borrowings and $141.4 million in long-term debt.\nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities is net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to increased inventory purchases and was partially offset by improvement in net income (loss).\nAccounts payable increased by 29.0% to $229.9 million at the end of fiscal year 2021 compared to $178.2 million at the end of the prior fiscal year.\nInventory at the end of fiscal year 2021 was $346.9 million, representing an increase of 17.5% from the prior fiscal year inventory balance of $295.3 million.\nAccounts receivable, net of allowances, increased by 11.0% to $255.1 million at the end of fiscal year 2021 compared to $229.8 million at the end of the prior fiscal year, primary driven by an increase in sales.\nInvesting Activities. Investing cash flows primarily consist of capital expenditures and are offset by proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. The increase in investing activities in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to the sale of a foreign office for $10.7 million during fiscal year 2021.\nFinancing Activities. Financing cash flows primarily consist of borrowings and repayments of debt. The decrease in financing cash flows in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was reflective of our pay down of debt.\nMaterial Cash Requirements. We have obligations as part of our ordinary course of business. Our material cash requirements include: (1) operating lease obligations (see Note 13 Leases within the Consolidated Financial Statements); (2) debt repayments (see Note 10 Debt within the Consolidated Financial Statements); (3) non-cancellable purchase obligations (see Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements), (4) minimum royalty payments (see Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements); and (5) employee wages, benefits, and incentives. The expected timing of payments of our obligations is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. In addition, some of our purchasing requirements are not current obligations and are therefore not included above. For example, some of these requirements are not handled through binding contracts or are fulfilled by vendors on a purchase order basis within short time horizons. Moreover, we may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions (see Note 12 Taxes within the Consolidated Financial Statements), pensions (see Note 16 Employee Benefit Plans within the Consolidate Financial Statements) and other matters.\nBecause of our opportunities for profitable growth from marketing, we are strategically increasing our marketing spending. In fiscal year 2021, total marketing expenses were $168.4 million, representing 9.0% of total net sales for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $126.3 million in fiscal year 2020, which represented 7.8% of total net sales, a year-over-year increase of 33.3%.\nFor the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, we expect total capital expenditures to be between approximately $20 million to $25 million. Our capital expenditure budget is an estimate and is subject to change.\nSources of Liquidity. We believe cash flows from operations, combined with existing cash on hand and amounts available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the foreseeable future. Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity in the short-term and long-term, the success of our operations, in light of the market volatility and uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, among other factors, could impact our business and liquidity. In the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our spending or sell assets or equity or debt securities.\nThe following table shows our sources of liquidity (in millions):\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>316.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolver availability </td> <td> </td> <td>199.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liquidity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>450.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>358.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNotes: In November of 2021, we sold $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes, generating net proceeds of approximately $141.7 million. On November 8, 2021, we used the majority of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes offering to repay the $122.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement. In connection with the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement, we incurred prepayment fees and accrued interest costs of $2.6 million. The remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.\nThe Senior Notes are our general unsecured obligations. The Senior Notes bear interest at the rate of 7.00% per annum. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30 of each year, commencing on February 28, 2022. The Senior Notes will mature on November 30, 2026. We may redeem the Senior Notes for cash in whole or in part at any time at our option. Prior to November 30, 2023, the redemption price will be $25.00 per $25.00 principal amount of Senior Notes, plus a \"make-whole\u201d premium plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. On and after November 30, 2023, we may redeem the Senior Notes (i) on or after November 30, 2023 and prior to November 30, 2024, at a price equal to $25.50 per $25.00 principal amount of Senior Notes, (ii) on or after November 30, 2024 and prior to November 30, 2025, at a price equal to $25.25 per $25.00 principal amount of Senior Notes and (iii) on or after November 30, 2025, at a price equal to $25.00 per $25.00 principal amount of Senior Notes, plus (in each case noted above) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.\nTerm Credit Agreement: On February 20, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to that certain Term Credit Agreement, dated as of September 26, 2019, by and among us, as borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders (the \"Term Credit Agreement Lenders\u201d) party thereto (as amended to date, the \"Term Credit Agreement\u201d). On May 12, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Term Credit Agreement to extend the deadline for delivery of our unaudited quarterly financial statements and related deliverables for the fiscal quarter ended April 4, 2020. On June 5, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 3 (the \"Third Amendment\u201d) to the Term Credit Agreement to further modify certain terms of the Term Credit Agreement to address the financial impact of COVID-19. On November 8, 2021, we used the majority of the net proceeds from the Notes Offering to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement. In connection with the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement, we incurred prepayment fees and accrued interest costs of $2.6 million and wrote off $7.1 million of debt issuance costs and $4.6 million of original issuance discount related to the Term Credit Agreement.\nRevolving Facility: On September 26, 2019, we and Fossil Partners L.P., as the U.S. borrowers, and Fossil Group Europe GmbH, Fossil Asia Pacific Limited, Fossil (Europe) GmbH, Fossil (UK) Limited and Fossil Canada Inc., as the non-U.S. borrowers, certain other of our subsidiaries from time to time party thereto designated as borrowers, and certain of our subsidiaries from time to time party thereto as guarantors, entered into a secured asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the \"Revolving Facility\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent (the \"ABL Agent\"), J.P. Morgan AG, as French collateral agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Citizens Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers, and Citizens Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-syndication agents and each of the lenders from time to time party thereto (the \"ABL Lenders\").\nThe Revolving Facility provides that the ABL Lenders may extend revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $225.0 million at any time outstanding (the Revolving Credit Commitment\u201d), of which up to $125.0 million is available under a U.S. facility, an aggregate of $70.0 million is available under a European facility, $20.0 million is available under a Hong Kong facility, $5.0 million is available under a French facility, and $5.0 million is available under a Canadian facility, in each case, subject to the borrowing base availability limitations described below. The Revolving Facility also includes an up to $45.0 million subfacility for the issuance of letters of credit (the Letters of Credit\u201d). The Revolving Facility expires and is due and payable on September 26, 2024. The French facility includes a $1.0 million subfacility for swingline loans, and the European facility includes a $7.0 million subfacility for swingline loans. The Revolving Facility is subject to a line cap (the Line Cap\u201d) equal to the lesser of the total Revolving Credit Commitment and the aggregate borrowing bases under the U.S. facility, the European facility, the Hong Kong facility, the French facility and the Canadian facility. Loans under the Revolving Facility may be made in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euros, Hong Kong dollars or pounds sterling.\nThe Revolving Facility is an asset-based facility, in which borrowing availability is subject to a borrowing base equal to: (a) with respect to us, the sum of (i) the lesser of (x) 90% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible U.S. finished goods inventory and (y) 65% of the lower of cost or market value of eligible U.S. finished goods inventory, plus (ii) 85% of the eligible U.S. accounts receivable, plus (iii) 90% of eligible U.S. credit card accounts receivable, minus (iv) the aggregate amount of reserves, if any, established by the ABL Agent; (b) with respect to each non-U.S. borrower (except for the French Borrower), the sum of (i) the lesser of (x) 90% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible foreign finished goods inventory of such non-U.S. borrower and (y) 65% of the lower of cost or market value of eligible foreign finished goods inventory of such non-U.S. borrower, plus (ii) 85% of the eligible foreign accounts receivable of such non-U.S. borrower, minus (iii) the aggregate amount of reserves, if any, established by the ABL Agent; and (c) with respect to the French Borrower, (i) 85% of eligible French accounts receivable minus (ii) the aggregate amount of reserves, if any, established by the ABL Agent. Not more than 60% of the aggregate borrowing base under the Revolving Facility may consist of the non-U.S. borrowing bases.\nFiscal Year 2021 Activity: During fiscal year 2021, we had net borrowings of $150.0 million under the Senior Notes at an average annual interest rate of 7.0%. We had net repayments of $152.0 million under the Term Credit Agreement during fiscal year 2021 at an average interest rate of 10.1%. We had net repayments of $96.1 million under the Revolving Facility during fiscal year 2021 at an average interest rate of 1.5%. As of January 1, 2022, we had $150.0 million outstanding under the Senior Notes and no balance outstanding under the Revolving Facility. As of January 1, 2022, we had unamortized debt issuance costs of $8.7 million which reduces the corresponding debt liability. In addition, we had $4.7 million of outstanding standby letters of credit at January 1, 2022. Amounts available under the Revolving Facility are reduced by any amounts outstanding under standby letters of credit. As of January 1, 2022, we had $199.7 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Facility. At January 1, 2022, we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our debt agreement.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Business, Item 1A. Risk Factors and our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results of operations may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those included in Item 1A. Risk Factors and other portions of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a global design, marketing and distribution company that specializes in consumer fashion accessories. Our principal offerings include an extensive line of men's and women's fashion watches and jewelry, handbags, small leather goods, belts, and sunglasses. In the watch and jewelry product categories, we have a diverse portfolio of globally recognized owned and licensed brand names under which our products are marketed.\nOur products are distributed globally through various distribution channels including wholesale in countries where we have a physical presence, direct to the consumer through our retail stores and commercial websites and through third-party distributors in countries where we do not maintain a physical presence. Our products are offered at varying price points to meet the needs of our customers, whether they are value-conscious or luxury oriented. Based on our range of accessory products, brands, distribution channels and price points, we are able to target style-conscious consumers across a wide age spectrum on a global basis.\nKnown or Anticipated Trends\nBased on our recent operating results and current perspectives on our operating environment, we anticipate the following trends will continue to impact our operating results:\nCOVID-19: Our business operations and financial performance continue to be materially impacted by COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the global economies, disrupted global supply chains and financial markets, and led to significant travel and transportation restrictions, including periodic mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and orders to shelter-in-place. We remain focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees, customers and suppliers to minimize potential disruptions and supporting the community to address challenges posed by the global COVID-19 pandemic. The total impact of the pandemic on our business is uncertain and depends in part on future developments including the duration and spread of COVID-19, the availability and acceptance of vaccines and continuing actions taken by governmental authorities to control the outbreak and mitigate its impact, including effects of any vaccine mandates, restrictions on movement and commercial activities and further stimulus and unemployment benefits.\nSupply Chain: Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing supply. We rely on domestic and foreign suppliers to provide us with merchandise in a timely manner and at favorable prices. Certain key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, which exposes us to potential supply shortages that could disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products. Any interruption or delay in the supply of key components could significantly harm our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and cause us to lose sales. Among our foreign suppliers, China is the source of a substantial majority of our imports. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, increased international transit times, particularly for our leathers products and packaging, and increased shipping costs for a majority of our products. A disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise from China or a material increase in the cost of those goods or transportation without any offsetting price increases may significantly decrease our profits.\nData Security: We depend on information technology systems, the Internet and computer networks for a substantial portion of our retail and e-commerce businesses, including credit card transaction authorization and processing. We also receive and store personal information about our customers and employees, the protection of which is critical to us. In the normal course of our business, we collect, retain, and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information, over public networks. Despite the security measures we currently have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers have been, and will continue to be, vulnerable to theft of physical information, security breaches, hacking attempts, computer viruses and malware, ransomware, phishing, lost data and programming and/or human errors. To date, none of these risks, intrusions, attacks or human error have resulted in any material liability to us. While we carry insurance policies that would provide liability coverage for certain of these matters, if we experience a significant security incident, we could be subject to liability or other damages that exceed our insurance coverage, and we cannot be certain that such insurance policies will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\nBusiness Strategies and Outlook: Notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic, we plan to execute the following strategies to enhance our brands, grow our revenue and improve profitability. The first strategic initiative is to increase brand excitement by crafting compelling stories that build upon brand equities for both owned and licensed brands across our product categories. Key to this strategy is our ongoing effort in innovation in our product categories and marketing capabilities, where we aim to build larger communities of brand loyalists. Our second strategic initiative is to increase digital engagement and online sales. We continue to invest in our owned e-commerce sites around the world and in third party marketplaces to enhance our direct to consumer engagement, which we believe can build long-term customer value. Our third strategic initiative is to optimize our operations. We initiated the New World Fossil - Transform to Grow (\"NWF 2.0\u201d) initiative in 2019 aimed to further simplify our operations and to reallocate resources toward growth, and we achieved our $250 million run-rate savings goal in 2021. Although we are nearing completion of our NWF 2.0 program, we will continue to optimize our operations with further reductions to our store footprint and increased focus on inventory management and supply chain efficiency. Our fourth strategic initiative is to expand our opportunity in mainland China and India. In these countries, we are continuing to execute against a strategy centered around localized marketing and segmented assortments. Although the impact of COVID-19 is likely to disrupt our growth trajectory in the short to intermediate term, we continue to view mainland China and India as compelling long-term opportunities.\nNotes Offering: In November 2021, we sold $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.00% Senior Notes due 2026. We used the majority of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes offering to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement (as defined below). In connection with the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement, we incurred prepayment fees and accrued interest costs of $2.6 million and wrote off $7.1 million of debt issuance costs and $4.6 million of original issuance discount related to the Term Credit Agreement. The remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes\nOperating Segments\nWe operate our business in three segments which are divided into geographies. Net sales for each geographic segment are based on the location of the selling entity and each reportable segment provides similar products and services.\nAmericas: The Americas segment is comprised of sales from our operations in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Sales are generated through diversified distribution channels that include wholesalers, distributors, and direct to consumer. Within each channel, we sell our products through a variety of physical point of sale, distributors and e-commerce channels. In the direct to consumer channel, we had 162 Company-owned stores as of the end of fiscal 2021 and an extensive collection of products available through our owned websites. As of the end of fiscal 2021, net sales in the Americas segment accounted for 42.0% of our consolidated revenue.\nEurope: The Europe segment is comprised of sales to customers based in European countries, the Middle East and Africa. Sales are generated through diversified distribution channels that include wholesalers, distributors and direct to consumer. Within each channel, we sell our products through a variety of physical points of sale, distributors, and e-commerce channels. In the direct to consumer channel, we had 125 Company-owned stores as of the end of fiscal 2021 and an extensive collection of products available through our owned websites. As of the end of fiscal 2021, net sales in the Europe segment accounted for 32.6% of our consolidated revenue.\nAsia: The Asia segment is comprised of sales to customers based in Australia, China (including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan), India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand. Sales are generated through diversified distribution channels that include wholesalers, distributors and direct to consumer. Within each channel, we sell our products through a variety of physical points of sale, distributors, and e-commerce channels. In the direct to consumer channel, we had 83 Company-owned stores as of the end of fiscal 2021 and an extensive collection of products available through our owned websites. As of the end of fiscal 2021, net sales in the Asia segment accounted for 24.4% of our consolidated revenue.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to product returns, bad debt, inventories, long-lived asset impairment, impairment of trade names, income taxes, warranty costs and litigation liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting subjects require the most significant estimates and judgments.\nProduct Returns. We monitor customer returns and maintain a provision for estimated returns based upon historical experience, current information and any specific issues identified. While returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, future return rates may differ from those experienced in the past. In the event that our products are performing poorly in the retail market and/or we experience product damages or defects at a rate significantly higher than our historical rate, the resulting returns could have an adverse impact on the operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur. If our allowance for product returns were to change by 10%, the impact, excluding taxes, would have been an approximate $2.1 million change to net income (loss).\nInventories. We account for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the average cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about forecasted sales demand, market conditions and available liquidation channels. Valuation of existing smartwatch inventory can be negatively impacted by the emergence of newer generation product. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, or if liquidation channels are not readily available, additional inventory valuation reductions may be required. We assess our off-price sales on an ongoing basis and update our estimates accordingly. For every 1% of additional inventory valuation reductions as of fiscal year end 2021, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $0.2 million.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Lease Impairment. We test for asset impairment of property, plant and equipment and lease assets whenever events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows related to the asset. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, we calculate fair value using our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. When undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated through the operations of our Company-owned retail stores are less than the carrying value of the underlying assets, the assets are impaired. If it is determined that assets are impaired, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the asset's book value exceeds its fair value. Should actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated, additional losses may be recorded. We recorded impairment losses in other long-lived asset impairments of $7.5 million, $27.3 million and $7.9 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to lease assets. We recorded impairment losses in other long-lived asset impairments of $1.7 million, $4.0 million and $0.7 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to property, plant and equipment. We recorded impairment losses in restructuring charges of $0.7 million, $2.9 million and $1.7 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to lease assets. We recorded impairment losses in restructuring charges of $0.2 million, $1.1 million and $0.6 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to property, plant and equipment. In fiscal year 2021, an increase of 100 basis points to the discount rate would not have resulted in an increase to property, plant and equipment and lease impairment expense. A 10% decrease in future expected cash flows would have increased impairment expense by $1.1 million.\nIncome Taxes. We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (\"ASC 740\"). Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made. The valuation allowance for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $123.0 million, $109.3 million and $118.1 million, respectively.\nOur continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. We accrue an amount for our estimate of additional income tax liability which we believe we are more likely than not to incur as a result of the ultimate resolution of tax audits (\"uncertain tax positions\"). We review and update the estimates used in the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities upon completion of tax audits, expiration of statutes of limitation, or occurrence of other events. The results of operations and financial position for future periods could be impacted by changes in assumptions or resolutions of tax audits.\nThe GILTI provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"TCJ Act\u201d) requiring the inclusion of certain foreign earnings in U.S. taxable income will continue to have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate. The GILTI impact will be accounted for as incurred under the period cost method. In addition, our valuation allowance analysis is affected by various aspects of the TCJ Act, including the limitation on the deductibility of interest expense and the impact of the GILTI. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d) which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, allowed a carryback of the Company's net operating losses for fiscal years 2019 and 2020. Valuation allowances in the amount of $23.1 million related to these loss carrybacks were released in fiscal year 2020.\nKey Measures of Financial Performance and Key Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nConstant Currency Financial Information: As a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The translation of the operations of our foreign-based entities from their local currencies into U.S. dollars is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and can have a significant impact on our reported financial results. In general, our overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business.\nAs a result, in addition to presenting financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), our discussion contains references to constant currency financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. To calculate net sales on a constant currency basis, net sales for the current fiscal year for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average rates during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. We present constant currency information to provide investors with a basis to evaluate how our underlying business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The constant currency financial information presented herein should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between constant currency financial information and the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included where applicable.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted operating income (loss), Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures. We define Adjusted EBITDA as our income (loss) before income taxes, plus interest expense, amortization and depreciation, impairment expense, other non-cash charges, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring expense and unamortized debt issuance costs included in loss on extinguishment of debt minus interest income. We define Adjusted operating income (loss) as operating income (loss) before impairment expense and restructuring expense. We define Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share as net income attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. and diluted earnings per share, respectively, before impairment expense, restructuring expense and unamortized debt issuance costs included in loss on extinguishment of debt. We have included Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted operating income (loss), Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share herein because they are widely used by investors for valuation and for comparing our financial performance with the performance of our competitors. We also use these non-GAAP financial measures to monitor and compare the financial performance of our operations. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted operating income (loss), Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures other companies report. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted operating income (loss), Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share are not intended to be used as alternatives to any measure of our performance in accordance with GAAP.\nDigital Sales: Due to shifting consumer traffic patterns and digital buying trends, we continue to accelerate our investments and capabilities in our global digital platform, and digital sales provide an important metric for our company. The digital space provides unique ways of engaging our customers. Digital sales include sales on our own e-commerce sites, global third party platforms, and wholesale dot com sites.\nComparable Retail Sales: Both stores and e-commerce sites are included in comparable retail sales in the thirteenth month of operation. Stores that experience a gross square footage increase of 10% or more due to an expansion and/or relocation are removed from the comparable store sales base, but are included in total sales. These stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month following the expansion and/or relocation. Comparable retail sales were adjusted to normalize the 52-week fiscal year 2021 with the 53-week fiscal year 2020. Comparable retail sales also exclude the effects of foreign currency fluctuations.\nStore Counts: While macro economic factors have shifted sales away from traditional brick and mortar stores towards digital channels, store counts continue to provide a key metric for management. Over time, we have made progress right-sizing our fleet of stores, focusing on closing our least profitable stores, and the size and quality of our store fleet have a direct impact on our sales and profitability.\nTotal Liquidity: We define Total liquidity as cash and cash equivalents plus available borrowings on our revolving credit facility. We monitor and forecast Total liquidity to ensure we can meet our financial obligations.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenues from sales of our products, including those that are subject to inventory consignment agreements, are recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer and in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for the product. We accept limited returns from customers. We continually monitor returns and maintain a provision for estimated returns based upon historical experience and any specific issues identified. Product returns are accounted for as reductions to revenue and cost of sales and increases to customer liabilities and other current assets to the extent the returned product is resalable.\nCost of Sales includes raw material costs, assembly labor, assembly overhead including depreciation expense, assembly warehousing costs and shipping and handling costs related to the movement of finished goods from assembly locations to sales distribution centers and from sales distribution centers to customer locations. Additionally, cost of sales includes customs duties, product packaging cost, royalty cost associated with sales of licensed products, the cost of molding and tooling and inventory shrinkage and damages.\nGross Profit and gross profit margin are influenced by our diversified business model that includes, but is not limited to: (i) product categories that we distribute; (ii) the multiple brands, including both owned and licensed, we offer within several product categories; (iii) the geographical presence of our businesses; and (iv) the different distribution channels we sell to or through.\nThe attributes of this diversified business model produce varying ranges of gross profit margin. Generally, on a historical basis, our fashion branded traditional watch and jewelry offerings produce higher gross profit margins than our smartwatches and leather goods offerings. In addition, in most product categories that we offer, brands with higher retail price points generally produce higher gross profit margins compared to those of lower retail priced brands. However, smartwatches carry relatively lower margins than our other major product categories. Gross profit margins related to sales in our Europe and Asia businesses are historically higher than our Americas business, primarily due to the following factors: (i) premiums charged in comparison to retail prices on products sold in the U.S.; (ii) the product sales mix in our international businesses, in comparison to our Americas business, is comprised more predominantly of watches and jewelry that generally produce higher gross profit margins than leather goods; and (iii) the watch sales mix in our Europe and Asia businesses, in comparison to our Americas business, are comprised more predominantly of higher priced licensed brands.\nOperating Expenses include selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\"), trade name impairments, other long-lived asset impairments and restructuring charges. SG&A expenses include selling and distribution expenses primarily consisting of sales and distribution labor costs, sales distribution center and warehouse facility costs, depreciation expense related to sales distribution and warehouse facilities, the four-wall operating costs of our retail stores, point-of-sale expenses, advertising expenses and art, design and product development labor costs. SG&A also includes general and administrative expenses primarily consisting of administrative support labor and support costs such as treasury, legal, information services, accounting, internal audit, human resources, executive management costs and costs associated with stock-based compensation. Restructuring charges include costs to reorganize, refine and optimize our Company's infrastructure and store closures under our New World Fossil initiatives.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020\nConsolidated Net Sales. Net sales increased $256.7 million or 15.9% (13.8% in constant currency) for fiscal year 2021, as compared to fiscal year 2020. We experienced sales increases in all three geographic segments and in the watches and jewelry product categories, while leathers decreased. In watches, strong sales growth in traditional watches was partially offset with sales declines in smartwatches, due to fewer smartwatch liquidations in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, and as a result of certain of our brands exiting the smartwatch category. In fiscal year 2021, digital sales, which include sales from our owned e-commerce channels, third party e-commerce platforms and wholesale dot com, were 41% of worldwide net sales. Digital sales increased 23% (20% in constant currency) in fiscal year 2021, compared to fiscal year 2020. Comparable retail sales increased 3.2% on a 52-week calendar basis during fiscal year 2021.\nThe following table sets forth consolidated net sales by segment and the changes in net sales by segment on both a reported and constant currency basis from period to period (dollars in millions):\n\nThe following table sets forth product net sales and the changes in product net sales on both a reported and constant currency basis from period to period (dollars in millions):\n\nThe following table sets forth the number of stores by concept for the fiscal years ended below:\n\nAmericas Net Sales. Americas net sales increased $143.7 million or 22.4% (21.4% in constant currency) for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 with strong sales increases in the U.S. and Mexico and a slight decrease in Canada. Traditional watch sales increased while smartwatches net sales were flat. Within the smartwatch category, sales growth in current generation product was offset by reduced levels of smartwatch liquidation of older generation product in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, and as a result of certain of our brands exiting the smartwatch category. Sales increased in multiple brands during fiscal year 2021, most notably in MICHAEL KORS\u00ae and FOSSIL\u00ae. Strong sales growth in our wholesale, retail stores and third party e-commerce channels more than offset a sales decrease in our owned e-commerce channel. Comparable retail sales increased moderately on a 52-week calendar basis during fiscal year 2021, with strong growth in our retail stores partially offset by a moderate decline in e-commerce net sales.\nThe following table sets forth product net sales and the changes in product net sales on both a reported and constant currency basis from period to period for the Americas segment (dollars in millions):\n\nEurope Net Sales. During fiscal year 2021, Europe net sales increased $87.8 million or 16.8% (14.2% in constant currency) in comparison to fiscal year 2020. Our sales growth in traditional watches was partially offset by sales declines in smartwatches, due to fewer smartwatch liquidations of older generation product in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, and as a result of certain of our brands exiting the smartwatch category. During fiscal year 2021, sales increased in most major brands, most notably in MICHAEL KORS and FOSSIL. Strong growth in our third party e-commerce and wholesale channels more than offset a moderate decline in comparable retail sales on a 52-week calendar basis during fiscal year 2021 driven by traffic declines primarily due to COVID-19 restrictions in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nThe following table sets forth product net sales and the changes in product net sales on both a reported and constant currency basis from period to period for the Europe segment (dollars in millions):\n\nAsia Net Sales. In fiscal year 2021, Asia net sales increased $20.9 million or 4.8% (1.7% in constant currency) in comparison to fiscal 2020. Our sales growth in traditional watches was partially offset by sales declines in smartwatches, due to fewer smartwatch liquidations of older generation product in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, and as a result of certain of our brands exiting the smartwatch category. EMPORIO ARMANI\u00ae, ARMANI EXCHANGE\u00ae and MICHAEL KORS saw moderate sales growth while most other brands declined or remained flat for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020. While we saw strong e-commerce sales growth for the full fiscal year 2021, sales slowed in the back half of the year as consumers shifted from traditional e-commerce platforms to social commerce. E-commerce growth was partially offset by significant retail stores declines, as a result of decreased traffic and temporary store closures, and a slight decline in the wholesale channel, negatively impacted by travel retail restrictions. Comparable retail sales decreased moderately on a 52-week calendar basis with a decline in retail stores partially offset by slight growth in our owned e-commerce for fiscal year 2021. Within the region, we had strong sales growth in fiscal year 2021 in India and Hong Kong, China and moderate sales growth in mainland China where sales declined in the back half of the year as compared to fiscal year 2020. Sales declined in the other major markets for fiscal year 2021.\nThe following table sets forth product net sales and the changes in product net sales on both a reported and constant currency basis from period to period for the Asia segment (dollars in millions):\n\nGross Profit. Gross profit of $966.4 million in fiscal year 2021 increased $196.1 million, or 25.5%, in comparison to $770.4 million in fiscal year 2020 driven by the increase in sales. Gross profit margin rate increased to 51.7% in fiscal year 2021 compared to 47.7% in fiscal year 2020. The gross margin improvement primarily reflects decreased liquidation and inventory valuation adjustments of older generation smartwatch products (which most heavily impacted the first quarter of fiscal year 2020), favorable currency changes and decreased promotional activity. Additionally, the gross profit margin rate was favorably impacted by reduced tariffs and reduced levels of minimum licensed product royalties, partially offset by increased freight costs and unfavorable regional and product mix.\nOperating Expenses. For fiscal year 2021, total operating expenses decreased to $873.7 million or 46.7% of net sales, compared to $905.7 million or 56.1% of net sales in fiscal year 2020. SG&A expenses were $842.6 million in fiscal year 2021 compared to $835.1 million in fiscal year 2020. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 45.1% in fiscal year 2021 as compared to 51.8% in fiscal year 2020, mainly driven by the contraction of sales in fiscal year 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and cost reductions driven by New World Fossil initiatives. During fiscal year 2021, we incurred restructuring costs of $21.9 million compared to restructuring costs of $36.5 million in fiscal year 2020. We incurred $9.2 million of other long-lived asset impairment charges and no non-cash intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal year 2021 compared to charges of $31.6 million and $2.5 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2020. The translation of foreign-denominated expenses during fiscal year 2021 increased operating expenses by approximately $13.8 million as a result of the weaker U.S. dollar.\nOperating Income (Loss). Operating income (loss) was income of $92.6 million in fiscal year 2021, as compared to a loss of $135.3 million in the prior fiscal year. The improvement in operating income (loss) primarily resulted from the $256.7 million increase in net sales during fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020, which was significantly impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and improved margin rate. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin was 5.0% in fiscal year 2021 as compared to (8.4)% in fiscal year 2020 and was positively impacted by 150 basis points due to changes in foreign currencies.\nOperating income (loss) by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\n\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased by $6.7 million in fiscal year 2021 primarily driven by a lower debt balance.\nOther Income (Expense)-Net. During fiscal year 2021, other income (expense) - net was expense of $14.5 million, including a $13.0 million loss on the extinguishment of debt, compared to expense of $4.8 million the prior fiscal year.\nProvision for Income Taxes. During fiscal year 2021, there was an income tax expense of $26.4 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 49.8%, compared to 44.2% in fiscal year 2020. The 2021 effective rate was unfavorably impacted by valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and the impact of GILTI whereas the 2020 effective rate benefited from the net operating loss carryback provision of the CARES Act that allowed the Company to recognize the benefit of the 2019 and 2020 U.S. tax losses since these losses were carried back to prior tax years resulting in tax refunds. Valuation allowances were released in 2020 related to these carrybacks.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. Fiscal year 2021 net income (loss) attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. was net income of $25.4 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, in comparison to a net loss of $96.1 million, or $1.88 per diluted share, in the prior fiscal year. The year-over-year improvement was mainly driven by increased sales due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior fiscal year and improved margin rate. Fiscal year 2021 included restructuring charges of $0.33 per diluted share and no non-cash intangible asset impairment charges. In comparison, fiscal year 2020 included restructuring charges of $0.56 per diluted share and non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $0.04 per diluted share. Currency fluctuations favorably impacted the year-over-year diluted earnings (loss) per share by $0.46.\nAdjusted EBITDA. The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is income (loss) before income taxes. Certain line items presented in the table below, when aggregated, may not foot due to rounding (dollars in millions).\n\nAdjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Share. The following tables reconcile Adjusted operating income (loss), Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted earnings (loss) per share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are operating income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. and diluted earnings (loss) per share, respectively. Certain line items presented in the table below, when aggregated, may not foot due to rounding.\n\n\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019\nFor a discussion of our results of operations in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, please see Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2021 filed with the SEC, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of fiscal year 2021 was $250.8 million, including $199.0 million held by foreign subsidiaries outside the U.S., in comparison to $316.0 million at the end of fiscal year 2020, including $277.4 million held by foreign subsidiaries outside the U.S. Historically, our business operations have not required substantial cash during the first several months of our fiscal year. Generally, starting in the third quarter, our cash needs begin to increase, typically reaching a peak in the September-November time frame as we increase inventory levels in advance of the holiday season. Our quarterly cash requirements are also impacted by debt repayments, restructuring charges, strategic investments such as acquisitions, share repurchases and other capital expenditures.\nAt the end of fiscal year 2021, we had working capital of $487.1 million compared to working capital of $431.9 million at the end of the prior fiscal year. At the end of fiscal year 2021, we had $0.6 million of outstanding short-term borrowings and $141.4 million in long-term debt.\nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities is net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to increased inventory purchases and was partially offset by improvement in net income (loss).\nAccounts payable increased by 29.0% to $229.9 million at the end of fiscal year 2021 compared to $178.2 million at the end of the prior fiscal year.\nInventory at the end of fiscal year 2021 was $346.9 million, representing an increase of 17.5% from the prior fiscal year inventory balance of $295.3 million.\nAccounts receivable, net of allowances, increased by 11.0% to $255.1 million at the end of fiscal year 2021 compared to $229.8 million at the end of the prior fiscal year, primary driven by an increase in sales.\nInvesting Activities. Investing cash flows primarily consist of capital expenditures and are offset by proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. The increase in investing activities in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to the sale of a foreign office for $10.7 million during fiscal year 2021.\nFinancing Activities. Financing cash flows primarily consist of borrowings and repayments of debt. The decrease in financing cash flows in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was reflective of our pay down of debt.\nMaterial Cash Requirements. We have obligations as part of our ordinary course of business. Our material cash requirements include: (1) operating lease obligations (see Note 13 Leases within the Consolidated Financial Statements); (2) debt repayments (see Note 10 Debt within the Consolidated Financial Statements); (3) non-cancellable purchase obligations (see Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements), (4) minimum royalty payments (see Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements); and (5) employee wages, benefits, and incentives. The expected timing of payments of our obligations is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. In addition, some of our purchasing requirements are not current obligations and are therefore not included above. For example, some of these requirements are not handled through binding contracts or are fulfilled by vendors on a purchase order basis within short time horizons. Moreover, we may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions (see Note 12 Taxes within the Consolidated Financial Statements), pensions (see Note 16 Employee Benefit Plans within the Consolidate Financial Statements) and other matters.\nBecause of our opportunities for profitable growth from marketing, we are strategically increasing our marketing spending. In fiscal year 2021, total marketing expenses were $168.4 million, representing 9.0% of total net sales for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $126.3 million in fiscal year 2020, which represented 7.8% of total net sales, a year-over-year increase of 33.3%.\nFor the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, we expect total capital expenditures to be between approximately $20 million to $25 million. Our capital expenditure budget is an estimate and is subject to change.\nSources of Liquidity. We believe cash flows from operations, combined with existing cash on hand and amounts available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the foreseeable future. Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity in the short-term and long-term, the success of our operations, in light of the market volatility and uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, among other factors, could impact our business and liquidity. In the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our spending or sell assets or equity or debt securities.\nThe following table shows our sources of liquidity (in millions):\n\nNotes: In November of 2021, we sold $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes, generating net proceeds of approximately $141.7 million. On November 8, 2021, we used the majority of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes offering to repay the $122.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement. In connection with the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement, we incurred prepayment fees and accrued interest costs of $2.6 million. The remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.\nThe Senior Notes are our general unsecured obligations. The Senior Notes bear interest at the rate of 7.00% per annum. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30 of each year, commencing on February 28, 2022. The Senior Notes will mature on November 30, 2026. We may redeem the Senior Notes for cash in whole or in part at any time at our option. Prior to November 30, 2023, the redemption price will be $25.00 per $25.00 principal amount of Senior Notes, plus a \"make-whole\u201d premium plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. On and after November 30, 2023, we may redeem the Senior Notes (i) on or after November 30, 2023 and prior to November 30, 2024, at a price equal to $25.50 per $25.00 principal amount of Senior Notes, (ii) on or after November 30, 2024 and prior to November 30, 2025, at a price equal to $25.25 per $25.00 principal amount of Senior Notes and (iii) on or after November 30, 2025, at a price equal to $25.00 per $25.00 principal amount of Senior Notes, plus (in each case noted above) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.\nTerm Credit Agreement: On February 20, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to that certain Term Credit Agreement, dated as of September 26, 2019, by and among us, as borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders (the \"Term Credit Agreement Lenders\u201d) party thereto (as amended to date, the \"Term Credit Agreement\u201d). On May 12, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Term Credit Agreement to extend the deadline for delivery of our unaudited quarterly financial statements and related deliverables for the fiscal quarter ended April 4, 2020. On June 5, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 3 (the \"Third Amendment\u201d) to the Term Credit Agreement to further modify certain terms of the Term Credit Agreement to address the financial impact of COVID-19. On November 8, 2021, we used the majority of the net proceeds from the Notes Offering to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement. In connection with the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement, we incurred prepayment fees and accrued interest costs of $2.6 million and wrote off $7.1 million of debt issuance costs and $4.6 million of original issuance discount related to the Term Credit Agreement.\nRevolving Facility: On September 26, 2019, we and Fossil Partners L.P., as the U.S. borrowers, and Fossil Group Europe GmbH, Fossil Asia Pacific Limited, Fossil (Europe) GmbH, Fossil (UK) Limited and Fossil Canada Inc., as the non-U.S. borrowers, certain other of our subsidiaries from time to time party thereto designated as borrowers, and certain of our subsidiaries from time to time party thereto as guarantors, entered into a secured asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the \"Revolving Facility\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent (the \"ABL Agent\"), J.P. Morgan AG, as French collateral agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Citizens Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers, and Citizens Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-syndication agents and each of the lenders from time to time party thereto (the \"ABL Lenders\").\nThe Revolving Facility provides that the ABL Lenders may extend revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $225.0 million at any time outstanding (the Revolving Credit Commitment\u201d), of which up to $125.0 million is available under a U.S. facility, an aggregate of $70.0 million is available under a European facility, $20.0 million is available under a Hong Kong facility, $5.0 million is available under a French facility, and $5.0 million is available under a Canadian facility, in each case, subject to the borrowing base availability limitations described below. The Revolving Facility also includes an up to $45.0 million subfacility for the issuance of letters of credit (the Letters of Credit\u201d). The Revolving Facility expires and is due and payable on September 26, 2024. The French facility includes a $1.0 million subfacility for swingline loans, and the European facility includes a $7.0 million subfacility for swingline loans. The Revolving Facility is subject to a line cap (the Line Cap\u201d) equal to the lesser of the total Revolving Credit Commitment and the aggregate borrowing bases under the U.S. facility, the European facility, the Hong Kong facility, the French facility and the Canadian facility. Loans under the Revolving Facility may be made in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euros, Hong Kong dollars or pounds sterling.\nThe Revolving Facility is an asset-based facility, in which borrowing availability is subject to a borrowing base equal to: (a) with respect to us, the sum of (i) the lesser of (x) 90% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible U.S. finished goods inventory and (y) 65% of the lower of cost or market value of eligible U.S. finished goods inventory, plus (ii) 85% of the eligible U.S. accounts receivable, plus (iii) 90% of eligible U.S. credit card accounts receivable, minus (iv) the aggregate amount of reserves, if any, established by the ABL Agent; (b) with respect to each non-U.S. borrower (except for the French Borrower), the sum of (i) the lesser of (x) 90% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible foreign finished goods inventory of such non-U.S. borrower and (y) 65% of the lower of cost or market value of eligible foreign finished goods inventory of such non-U.S. borrower, plus (ii) 85% of the eligible foreign accounts receivable of such non-U.S. borrower, minus (iii) the aggregate amount of reserves, if any, established by the ABL Agent; and (c) with respect to the French Borrower, (i) 85% of eligible French accounts receivable minus (ii) the aggregate amount of reserves, if any, established by the ABL Agent. Not more than 60% of the aggregate borrowing base under the Revolving Facility may consist of the non-U.S. borrowing bases.\nFiscal Year 2021 Activity: During fiscal year 2021, we had net borrowings of $150.0 million under the Senior Notes at an average annual interest rate of 7.0%. We had net repayments of $152.0 million under the Term Credit Agreement during fiscal year 2021 at an average interest rate of 10.1%. We had net repayments of $96.1 million under the Revolving Facility during fiscal year 2021 at an average interest rate of 1.5%. As of January 1, 2022, we had $150.0 million outstanding under the Senior Notes and no balance outstanding under the Revolving Facility. As of January 1, 2022, we had unamortized debt issuance costs of $8.7 million which reduces the corresponding debt liability. In addition, we had $4.7 million of outstanding standby letters of credit at January 1, 2022. Amounts available under the Revolving Facility are reduced by any amounts outstanding under standby letters of credit. As of January 1, 2022, we had $199.7 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Facility. At January 1, 2022, we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our debt agreement.", "item_7_tables": "Table 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
