Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a number of important factors, particularly those described under the caption Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a leading specialized distributor of water, wastewater, storm drainage and fire protection products and related services to municipalities, private water companies and professional contractors across municipal, non-residential and residential end markets nationwide. Our specialty products and services are used in the maintenance, repair, replacement, and construction of water and fire protection infrastructure. We reach customers through a nationwide network of approximately 300 branches across 48 states. Our products include pipes, valves, fittings, storm drainage products, fire protection products, meter products and other products for use in the construction, maintenance and repair of water and waste-water systems as well as fire protection systems. We complemented our core products through additional offerings, including smart meter systems, fusible high-density polyethylene ( fusible HDPE\u201d) piping solutions and specifically engineered treatment plant products, services and geosynthetics used in erosion control. Our services and capabilities allow for integration with customers and form part of their sourcing and procurement function.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Company is a holding company and its sole material asset is its direct and indirect ownership interest in Holdings. Holdings has no operations and no material assets of its own other than its indirect ownership interest in Core & Main LP, a Florida limited partnership, the legal entity that conducts the operations of Core & Main. Because Core & Main is the general partner of Holdings, it operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Holdings and, through Holdings and its subsidiaries, conducts our business. Accordingly, the consolidated financial information of Core & Main presented herein, including the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, includes the consolidated financial information of Holdings and its subsidiaries. The ownership interest of the Continuing Limited Partners related to Partnership Interests held by the Continuing Limited Partners is reflected as non-controlling interests in Core & Main's consolidated financial statements.\nAs the Reorganization Transactions (as defined below under -Significant Events During Fiscal 2021\u201d) are accounted for as transactions between entities under common control, the financial statements for the periods prior to our IPO and Reorganization Transactions have been adjusted to combine previously separate entities for presentation purposes. These entities include Core & Main, Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries and the Blocker Companies (as defined below under -Significant Events During Fiscal 2021\u201d). Prior to the Reorganization Transactions, Core & Main had no operations.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31st. Quarters within the fiscal year include 13-week periods, unless a fiscal year includes a 53rd week, in which case the fourth quarter of the fiscal year will be a 14-week period. The fiscal years ended January 30, 2022, January 31, 2021 and February 2, 2020 included 52 weeks. The next fiscal year ending January 29, 2023 ( fiscal 2022\u201d) will also include 52 weeks.\nSignificant Events During Fiscal 2021\nInitial Public Offering\nCore & Main is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on April 9, 2021 for the purpose of facilitating our IPO and other related transactions, as described below, in order to carry on the business of Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries. On July 27, 2021, we completed our initial public offering of 34,883,721 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $20.00 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $664 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. All of the net proceeds from the IPO, less $8 million of transaction costs directly attributable to the IPO, were utilized to purchase 34,883,721 newly issued Partnership Interests of Holdings for approximately $656 million in the aggregate. In turn, Holdings and Core & Main LP utilized the net proceeds from the IPO directly or indirectly received from Core & Main in the Refinancing Transactions (as defined and described under -Refinancing Transactions.\u201d)\nOn August 20, 2021, we issued 5,232,558 shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock in connection with the IPO at the initial public offering price of $20.00 per share before underwriting discounts and commissions (the IPO Overallotment Option Exercise\u201d). We received net proceeds of approximately $100 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. All of the net proceeds were utilized to purchase 5,232,558 newly issued Partnership Interests of Holdings at a price per unit equal to the public offering price per share less underwriting discounts and commissions. In turn, Holdings and Core & Main LP utilized the net proceeds received directly or indirectly from Core & Main for general corporate purposes.\nSecondary Offering\nOn January 10, 2022, a secondary public offering of 20,000,000 shares of Class A common stock by certain selling stockholders affiliated with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (the Selling Stockholders\u201d) was completed at a price to the public of $26.00 per share (the Secondary Offering\u201d). As part of the Secondary Offering, 7,455,242 Partnership Interests were exchanged, together with the retirement of a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock, for an equal number of shares of Class A common stock, which were a portion of the shares sold by the Selling Stockholders. These shares were sold along with an existing 12,544,758 shares of Class A common stock held by the Selling Stockholders. The Company did not sell any shares of Class A common stock in the Secondary Offering and did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale. The Company paid the costs associated with the sale of shares by the Selling Stockholders, other than the underwriting discounts and commissions.\nReorganization Transactions\nIn connection with the IPO, we completed the following transactions (collectively the Reorganization Transactions\u201d):\n\u2022the formation of Core & Main as a Delaware corporation to function as the direct and indirect parent of Holdings and a publicly traded entity;\n\u2022the amendment and restatement of the limited partnership agreement of Holdings to, among other things first, modify the capital structure of Holdings and second, admit Core & Main as the general partner and a limited partner of Holdings;\n\u2022Core & Main's acquisition of the Partnership Interests held by certain Former Limited Partners (as defined below) and the issuance of Class A common stock to the Former Limited Partners, pursuant to the mergers of CD&R WW Advisor, LLC and CD&R WW Holdings, LLC (the Blocker Companies\u201d) with and into Core & Main via merger subsidiaries of Core & Main (the Blocker Mergers\u201d); and\n\u2022entry into a Master Reorganization Agreement, dated as of July 22, 2021 (the Master Reorganization Agreement\u201d) with Holdings, the Continuing Limited Partners, the Blocker Companies, CD&R Waterworks Holdings GP, CD&R Associates X Waterworks, L.P., CD&R WW Holdings, L.P., Core & Main GP, LLC, CD&R Plumb Buyer, LLC, CD&R Fund X Advisor Waterworks B, L.P., CD&R Fund X Waterworks B1, L.P., CD&R Fund X-A Waterworks B, L.P., CD&R WW, LLC, Brooks Merger Sub 1, Inc. and Brooks Merger Sub 2, Inc. Pursuant to the Master Reorganization Agreement, the Former Limited Partners received Partnership Interests in exchange for their existing indirect ownership interests in Holdings and exchanged these Partnership Interests for shares of Class A common stock of Core & Main prior to the consummation of the IPO.\nThe Former Limited Partners are defined as CD&R Fund X Advisor Waterworks B, L.P., CD&R Fund X Waterworks B1, L.P., CD&R Fund X-A Waterworks B, L.P. and the other Original Limited Partners (as defined below) that transferred all or a portion of their Partnership Interests (including those held indirectly through the Blocker Companies) for shares of Class A common stock in connection with the Reorganization Transactions and the IPO, and represent entities that transferred all of their Partnership Interests (including Partnership Interests held indirectly through certain blocker\u201d corporations) for shares of Class A common stock in connection with the consummation of the Reorganization Transactions.\nThe Continuing Limited Partners are defined as CD&R Waterworks Holdings, LLC ( CD&R Waterworks Holdings\u201d) and Core & Main Management Feeder, LLC ( Management Feeder\u201d), and represent the Original Limited Partners that continued to own Partnership Interests after the Reorganization Transactions and that are entitled to exchange their Partnership Interests, together with the retirement of a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock, for shares of Class A common stock.\nThe Original Limited Partners are defined as CD&R Waterworks Holdings, the Former Limited Partners and Management Feeder and represent the direct and indirect owners of Holdings prior to the Reorganization Transactions and the IPO.\nImmediately following and as a result of the IPO, Reorganization Transactions and Secondary Offering:\n\u2022the shareholders of Core & Main, excluding the Continuing Limited Partners and the Former Limited Partners, collectively held 60,116,279 shares of Class A common stock consisting of 34,883,721 shares issued in the IPO, 5,232,558 shares issued pursuant to the IPO Overallotment Option Exercise on August 20, 2021 and 20,000,000 shares sold in the Secondary Offering on January 10, 2022;\n\u2022the Former Limited Partners collectively held 107,397,971 shares of Class A common stock;\n\u2022Core & Main, directly or indirectly through our wholly-owned subsidiary, held 167,522,403 Partnership Interests consisting of 154,834,603 Partnership Interests issued pursuant to the Reorganization Transactions and IPO, 5,232,558 Partnership Interests issued pursuant to the IPO Overallotment Option Exercise on August 20, 2021 and 7,455,242 Partnership Interests received in connection with the exchange of Partnership Interests, together with the retirement of a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock, for an equal number of shares of Class A common stock in the Secondary Offering; and\n\u2022the Continuing Limited Partners collectively held 8,153 shares of Class A common stock, 78,398,141 Partnership Interests and 78,398,141 shares of Class B common stock.\nRefinancing Transactions\nOn July 27, 2021, Core & Main LP: (i) amended the terms of the credit agreement governing the senior term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1,300 million maturing on August 1, 2024 issued by Core & Main LP (the Prior Term Loan Facility\u201d) in order to, among other things, enter into a new $1,500 million seven-year senior term loan (the Senior Term Loan Facility\u201d) and (ii) amended the terms of the credit agreement governing the senior asset-based revolving credit facility in order to, among other things, increase the aggregate amount of commitments by $150 million to $850 million overall and extend the maturity date from July 2024 to July 2026 (as amended, the Senior ABL Credit Facility\u201d). Core & Main LP and Holdings utilized the net proceeds from the IPO, together with the net proceeds from borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility and cash on hand, to redeem (i) all $300 million aggregate principal amount of the senior unsecured notes due September 15, 2024 issued by Holdings (the Senior 2024 Notes\u201d) then outstanding at a redemption price equal to 102.000% of the aggregate principal amount thereof and (ii) all $750 million aggregate principal amount of the senior unsecured notes due August 15, 2025 issued by Core & Main LP (the Senior 2025 Notes\u201d) then outstanding at a redemption price equal to 101.531% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, by satisfying and discharging the indenture governing the Senior 2025 Notes at the closing of the IPO and redeeming the Senior 2025 Notes on August 15, 2021. Additionally, Core & Main LP repaid $1,258 million outstanding under the Prior Term Loan Facility, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and settled the interest rate swap associated with the Prior Term Loan Facility (collectively, the Refinancing Transactions\u201d).\nPublic Company Costs\nIn connection with the IPO, we incurred one-time costs of approximately $11 million. We recorded $8 million as a reduction to additional paid in capital during fiscal 2021. Additionally, we recorded $3 million within selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2021.\nFollowing the IPO, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not previously incur, including costs associated with public company director and officer liability insurance, SEC reporting and corporate governance requirements, which expenses we estimate to be approximately $10 million annually on an ongoing basis. These requirements include compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Our financial statements for the periods following the IPO reflect the impact of these expenses\nPost-Offering Taxation and Expenses\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income of Holdings and will be taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates.\nIn connection with the Reorganization Transactions and the IPO, we entered into the Former Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement and the Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement. Prior and future exchanges of Partnership Interests in Holdings are expected to be treated as direct purchases of Partnership Interests for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which will result in increased deferred tax basis. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amounts that we would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities. We will receive the full benefit in tax savings and under the Tax Receivable Agreements will provide payment of 85% of the amount of any tax benefits we actually realize to the Former Limited Partners or the Continuing Limited Partners, as applicable, or their permitted transferees. We expect to benefit from the remaining 15% of any cash savings that we realize. Amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreements are contingent upon, among other things, (i) generation of sufficient future taxable income during the term of the Tax Receivable Agreements and (ii) future changes in tax laws. We intend to cause Holdings to make distributions to us in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay our tax obligations and to fund any payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreements.\nHistorically, Holdings has also made distributions to its non-controlling interests partners to fund their obligations to various taxing authorities. Following the Reorganization Transactions, Holdings expects to continue making distributions based on Partnership Interests, including distributions to us.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Business\nEnd-Markets and General Economic Conditions\nHistorically, demand for our products has been closely tied to municipal infrastructure spending, residential construction and non-residential construction in the U.S. We estimate that, based on fiscal 2021 net sales, our exposure by end market was approximately 39% municipal, 39% non-residential and 22% residential. Infrastructure spending and the non-residential and residential construction markets are subject to cyclical market pressures. Municipal demand has been relatively steady over the long term due to the consistent and immediate need to replace broken infrastructure, however activity levels are subject to the availability of funding for municipal projects. Non-residential and residential construction activities are primarily driven by availability of credit, interest rates, general economic conditions, consumer confidence and other factors that are beyond our control. The length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by market. Cyclicality can also have an impact on the products we procure for our customers or our related services, as further discussed under -Price Fluctuations\u201d below.\nIn November 2021, President Biden signed into law the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\u201d), which includes $55 billion to invest in water infrastructure across the United States. In the coming years, including as a result of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, we expect increased federal infrastructure investment to have a core focus on the upgrade, repair and replacement of municipal waterworks systems and to address demographic shifts and serve the growing population. We believe these dynamics create the backdrop for a favorable funding environment and accelerated investment in projects that will benefit our business.\nSeasonality\nOur operating results within a fiscal year are typically impacted by seasonality. Although weather patterns affect our operating results throughout the year, adverse winter weather historically has reduced construction, maintenance and repair activity. As a result, net sales are typically lower in our first and fourth fiscal quarters, especially in northern geographic regions. Abnormal levels of precipitation may negatively impact our operating results as it may result in the delay of construction projects. Our operating results may also be adversely affected by hurricanes, which typically occur during our third fiscal quarter. Our cash flows from operating activities are typically lower during the first and second fiscal quarters due to investment in working capital and annual incentive compensation payments and are typically higher during the third and fourth fiscal quarters due to cash inflows associated with receivable collections and reduced inventory purchases.\nPrice Fluctuations\nOur financial performance is impacted by price fluctuations in commodity-based products and our ability to reflect these changes, in a timely manner, in our customer pricing. Such commodity-based products include PVC, ductile iron, fusible HDPE and steel and copper pipe and tubing products, which accounted for approximately 32%, 24%, and 26% of our net sales in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019, respectively.\nWe are also exposed to fluctuations in costs for petroleum as we distribute a substantial portion of our products by truck. Petroleum prices have recently experienced significant increases as a result of the conflict in Ukraine. In addition, we are exposed to fluctuations in prices for imported products due to logistical challenges and changes in labor, fuel, container and other importation-related costs. We may also face price fluctuations on other products due to constrained labor availability and manufacturing capacity. Our ability to reflect these changes, in a timely manner, in our customer pricing may impact our financial performance.\nIf we are able to pass through price increases to our customers, our net sales will increase; conversely, during periods of deflation, our customer pricing may decrease to remain competitive, resulting in decreased net sales. The cost to procure the products we sell are historically volatile and subject to fluctuations arising from changes in supply and demand, national and international economic conditions, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulation, weather events, trade policies and periodic delays in the delivery of our products. Certain commodity-based products have recently experienced price inflation due to a decline in supply related to impacts of adverse weather conditions and other factors. During fiscal 2021, we experienced significant price inflation in respect of certain of our commodity-based products as well as other product categories, and supply chain, which we expect to continue to experience in the near-term and have sought to mitigate through inventory management, effective sourcing and customer pricing. Over the course of fiscal 2021, we experienced increasing pressure on our supply chain due to several factors, including, but not limited to, delays from our suppliers, labor availability, global logistics and the availability of raw materials, in part due to the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy that limited product availability and further exacerbated the effects of inflation. For example, access to certain meter products that we sell is dependent on the ability of our suppliers to obtain semi-conductor chips. The global supply shortage of semi-conductor chips has impacted various industries and companies, including us, and there is no certainty as to when availability will return to historic levels. As we have experienced significant inflation over a relatively short period, there is increased risk that we may experience a higher level of deflation or substantially lower net sales growth than in recent periods to the extent there are improvements in the availability of labor, transportation and products.\nInterest Rates\nCertain of our indebtedness, including borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility and the Senior ABL Credit Facility, are subject to variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase and our net income would decrease, even though the amount borrowed under the facilities remained the same. As of January 30, 2022, we had $1,493 million of outstanding variable-rate debt. We seek to mitigate our exposure to interest rate volatility through the entry into interest rate swap instruments, such as our current interest rate swap that effectively converts $1,000 million of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt, which notional amount decreases to $900 million on July 27, 2023, $800 million on July 27, 2024, and $700 million on July 27, 2025 through the instrument maturity on July 27, 2026. Despite these efforts, unfavorable movement in interest rates may result in higher interest expense and cash payments.\nAcquisitions\nIn addition to our organic growth strategy, we opportunistically pursue strategic asset and business acquisitions to grow our business. Below is a summary of the acquisitions that closed in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 and the related transaction value (in each case, excluding working capital and other purchase price adjustments, unless otherwise noted).\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Name </td> <td> </td> <td>Product Lines </td> <td> </td> <td>Closing Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Transaction Value\n(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> L&M Bag & Supply Co., Inc.

There can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions will be realized on the timeline we expect, or at all.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nGovernmental authorities nationally and in affected regions have responded (and continue to respond) to COVID-19 and related variants by mandating various restrictions in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. We have continued to operate as an essential business, providing products and services to our customers that they need to invest in and maintain our nation's infrastructure. We have implemented preparedness plans to help keep our team safe while we work, including new physical distancing processes and procedures, associate quarantine procedures, expanded work from home\u201d protocols and the use of additional personal protective equipment. Despite certain temporary branch closures during fiscal 2020 and the first quarter of fiscal 2021, all of our facilities currently are operational and able to fill orders, and our teams have worked effectively to address the few temporary closures we have experienced.\nThe public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the related government measures taken in response, have adversely affected (and could continue to adversely affect) some of the markets in which we operate. We experienced reduced demand for our products in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2020, and in response we deferred non-essential capital expenditures and other discretionary spending and temporarily paused acquisition-related activities, though we have since resumed these activities. In addition, the ability of certain of our associates to travel or otherwise perform their jobs was restricted and the ability of our customers to travel, conduct their business and pay or otherwise access credit was impaired. Following these government-instituted restrictions, we experienced temporary delays in certain construction and infrastructure projects primarily during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Our business stabilized during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as the substantial majority of construction and infrastructure activities resumed and sales volume returned to near pre-pandemic levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2021, we experienced supply chain disruptions related to COVID-19 and other supply chain constraints in certain product categories, including meters, and we expect to continue facing further supply chain disruptions as a result of the ongoing and dynamic COVID-19 pandemic. Over the course of fiscal 2021, we experienced increasing pressure on our supply chain due to several factors, including, but not limited to, delays from our suppliers, labor availability, global logistics and availability of raw materials that are in part due to the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy. Depending on the ultimate scope and duration of supply chain disruptions, we may experience increases in product costs which we may not be able to pass on to our customers, loss of sales due to lack of product availability or potential customer claims from the inability to provide products in accordance with contractual terms. We continue to proactively monitor the situation and our supply chain and assess further possible implications to our business.\nCARES Act\nOn March 27, 2020, the U.S. federal government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d). The CARES Act allowed for the deferral of the employer share of social security taxes for the period from March 27, 2020 through December 31, 2020, which improved cash flows from operating activities by $10 million for fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021, the Company had an operating cash outflow related to the payment of $5 million of the deferred payroll taxes. As of January 30, 2022, we have deferred payment of $5 million in employer share of social security taxes in accordance with the CARES Act that are required to be repaid by December 31, 2022. The payment of the deferred payroll taxes of $5 million in fiscal 2022 is expected to result in additional operating cash outflows during this period.\nThe CARES Act also modified certain provisions in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d) , including provisions regarding interest deductibility. For fiscal 2020, these changes did not materially impact our results of operations but did result in improved operating and financing cash flows. The expiration of certain CARES Act provisions with respect to the Code resulted in increased partner distributions by Holdings and tax payments by Core & Main in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020.\nKey Business Metrics\nNet Sales\nWe generate net sales primarily from the sale of water, wastewater, storm drainage and fire protection products and the provision of related services to approximately 60,000 customers, as of January 30, 2022, including municipalities, private water companies and professional contractors. We recognize sales, net of sales tax, customer incentives, returns and discounts. Net sales fluctuate as a result of changes in commodity-based product costs and tariffs. We seek to reflect these changes in our customer pricing in a timely manner, which will increase net sales if we are able to pass along price increases and decrease net sales if we are required to reduce our customer prices as a result of competitive dynamics.\nWe categorize our net sales into pipes, valves & fittings, storm drainage products, fire protection products and meter products:\n\u2022Pipe, valves, hydrants, fittings include these products and other complementary products and services. Pipe includes PVC, ductile iron, fusible HDPE, steel and copper tubing.\n\u2022Storm drainage products primarily include corrugated piping systems, retention basins, manholes, grates, geosynthetics used in erosion control and other related products.\n\u2022Fire protection products primarily include fire protection pipe, sprinkler heads and devices as well as custom fabrication services.\n\u2022Meter products primarily include smart meter products, installation, software and other services.\nGross Profit\nGross profit represents the difference between the product cost from suppliers (net of earned rebates and discounts and including the cost of inbound freight) and the net sale price to our customers. Gross profit may be impacted by the time between changes in supplier costs and tariffs and changes in our customer pricing. Gross profit may not be comparable to those of other companies, as other companies may include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses are primarily comprised of selling, general and administrative costs, which include personnel expenses (salaries, wages, incentive compensation, associate benefits and payroll taxes), rent, insurance, utilities, professional fees, freight out, fuel and repair and maintenance.\nNet Income\nNet income represents our net sales less our cost of sales, operating expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other expense and our provision for income taxes for Core & Main and the consolidation of Holdings and its subsidiaries.\nNet Income Attributable to Core & Main, Inc.\nNet income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. represents net income less income attributable to non-controlling interests. Non-controlling interests represent owners of Partnership Interests of Holdings other than Core & Main.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted for certain items management believes are not reflective of the underlying operations of our business, including (a) loss on debt modification and extinguishment, (b) equity-based compensation, (c) expenses associated with the IPO and subsequent secondary offerings and (d) expenses associated with acquisition activities. Adjusted EBITDA includes amounts otherwise attributable to non-controlling interests as we manage the consolidated company and evaluate operating performance in a similar manner. We use Adjusted EBITDA to assess the operating results and effectiveness of our business.

The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to higher average selling prices, representing approximately half of the net sales increase, strong market volume growth and share gains resulting from sales initiatives and preferred access to products during a period of material shortages, which helped drive growth across all product lines. Net sales growth for pipes, valves & fittings and storm drainage products benefited from end-market growth, acquisitions and higher average selling prices. Net sales growth for fire protection products also benefited from end-market growth and higher average selling prices. Net sales of meter products grew at a slower pace, relative to other product lines, primarily due to shortages of semi-conductor chips that are components of certain smart meter products.\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>January 30, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>January 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pipes, valves & fittings products\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Storm drainage products\n</td> <td>687 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fire protection products\n</td> <td>565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Meter products\n</td> <td>391 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit\nGross profit for fiscal 2021 increased $402 million, or 45.8%, to $1,280 million compared with $878 million for fiscal 2020. The increase in net sales contributed an additional $328 million of gross profit and the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales contributed $74 million. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2021 was 25.6% compared with 24.1% for fiscal 2020. The overall increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to strategic inventory investments ahead of announced price increases, a favorable pricing environment, the execution of our gross margin initiatives, achievement of growth based supplier incentives and accretive acquisitions.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses for fiscal 2021 increased $161 million, or 29.0%, to $717 million compared with $556 million during fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $101 million in personnel expenses, which was primarily driven by higher variable compensation costs and increased headcount, lower discretionary spending in response to COVID-19 in fiscal 2020, a volume driven increase in distribution costs and incremental costs from acquisitions. In addition, during fiscal 2021, SG&A expenses increased by $21 million related to higher equity-based compensation expense, primarily due to accounting for equity awards, and $5 million of other one-time costs in connection with the IPO and Secondary Offering. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was 14.3% for fiscal 2021 compared with 15.3% for fiscal 2020. The decrease was attributable to our ability to leverage our fixed costs, partially offset by higher equity-based compensation.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization ( D&A\u201d) expense for fiscal 2021 was $138 million compared with $137 million during fiscal 2020. The increase primarily was attributable to amortization related to the Pacific Pipe and L&M acquisitions, partially offset by lower amortization on existing customer relationship intangible assets.\nOperating Income\nOperating income for fiscal 2021 was $425 million compared with $185 million during fiscal 2020. The increase in operating income was attributable to higher net sales and gross profit, primarily from volume growth, price inflation, and acquisitions. These factors were partially offset by higher SG&A expenses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $98 million for fiscal 2021 compared with $139 million for fiscal 2020. The decrease was attributable to the redemption of the Senior 2024 Notes, the redemption of the Senior 2025 Notes and lower interest rates on the Senior Term Loan Facility as compared to the Prior Term Loan Facility due to the Refinancing Transactions completed on July 27, 2021.\nLoss on Debt Modification and Extinguishment\nFor fiscal 2021, we recognized a loss on debt modification and extinguishment of $51 million. The loss on debt modification and extinguishment included (i) a write off of $8 million in deferred financing fees associated with the redemption of the Senior 2024 Notes, (ii) a write off of $13 million in deferred financing fees associated with the redemption of the Senior 2025 Notes, (iii) a write off of $5 million in deferred financing fees associated with the settlement of the Prior Term Loan Facility, (iv) redemption premiums of $6 million and $12 million for the Senior 2024 Notes and Senior 2025 Notes, respectively, (v) the settlement of the cash flow interest rate swap of $5 million which had its changes in fair value previously attributed to accumulated other comprehensive loss, and (vi) third-party expenses for the Senior Term Loan Facility of $2 million.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for fiscal 2021 increased $42 million to $51 million compared with $9 million for fiscal 2020. For fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, our effective tax rates were 18.5% and 19.6%, respectively. The effective tax rate for each period reflects only the portion of net income that is attributable to taxable entities (which are comprised of Core & Main following the Reorganization Transactions and the Blocker Companies before the Reorganization Transactions), the impact of certain permanent book-tax differences and incremental tax expense due to our legal entity structure. The effective tax rates in fiscal 2021 were lower than fiscal 2020 due to certain fixed tax expenses and permanent differences decreasing as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes.\nNet Income\nNet income for fiscal 2021 increased $188 million to $225 million compared with $37 million for fiscal 2020. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to higher operating income and lower interest expense due to the Refinancing Transactions, partially offset by the $51 million loss on debt modification and an increase in income taxes.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests for fiscal 2021 was $59 million. This represents the allocation of the Holdings' net income for the period from July 23, 2021 through January 30, 2022, which included the $51 million loss on debt modification and extinguishment, to holders of Partnership Interests other than Core & Main.\nNet Income Attributable to Core & Main, Inc.\nNet income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. for fiscal 2021 was $166 million. The net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. includes the net income of Holdings for the period from February 1, 2021 to July 22, 2021.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Class A common stock basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2021 were $0.57 and $0.55, respectively. The Class A common stock basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share were calculated for the period from July 23, 2021 through January 30, 2022, the period following the Reorganization Transactions, which included the $51 million loss on debt modification and extinguishment.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2021 increased $262 million, or 76.6%, to $604 million compared with $342 million for fiscal 2020. Growth in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to higher net sales and improved gross profit margins.

The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to growth from the R&B acquisition in March 2020, which primarily impacted sales of pipes, valves & fittings and storm drainage products. The LIP acquisition in July 2019 was the primary driver of growth of the fire protection products. In addition, higher average selling prices drove approximately 2% of overall net sales growth. These increases were partially offset by a volume decline of approximately 2%, which was primarily attributable to reduced sales of fire protection and meter products due to restrictions related to COVID-19.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>January 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>February 2, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pipes, valves & fittings products\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Storm drainage products\n</td> <td>489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fire protection products\n</td> <td>414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Meter products\n</td> <td>366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit\nGross profit for fiscal 2020 increased $89 million, or 11.3%, to $878 million compared with $789 million for fiscal 2019. The increase in net sales contributed $61 million of gross profit and the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales contributed $28 million. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2020 was 24.1% compared with 23.3% for fiscal 2019. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to acquisitions along with sourcing and pricing improvements.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses for fiscal 2020 increased $47 million, or 9.3%, to $556 million compared with $509 million during fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $49 million from acquisitions, in addition to investments in technology and strategic initiative resources and higher incentive compensation costs. These increases were partially offset by furloughs, headcount reductions and lower discretionary spending in response to COVID-19. During fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, we recognized $7 million and $6 million, respectively, of expense associated with the amortization of a portion of the prepaid compensation balance included in up-front consideration payment for the LIP acquisition. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was 15.3% for fiscal 2020 compared with 15.0% for fiscal 2019. The increase in SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales was attributable to strategic investments and higher costs from acquisitions.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nD&A expense for fiscal 2020 was $137 million compared with $125 million during fiscal 2019. The increase was attributable to amortization expense related to the R&B acquisition and a full year of amortization related to the LIP acquisition in fiscal 2020. These increases were partially offset by lower amortization associated with customer relationship intangible assets.\nOperating Income\nOperating income for fiscal 2020 was $185 million compared with $155 million during fiscal 2019. The increase in operating income was attributable to higher net sales and gross profit, primarily from acquisitions, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses and amortization from acquisitions.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $139 million for fiscal 2020 compared with $113 million during fiscal 2019. The increase was attributable to a full year of interest expense associated with the $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior 2024 Notes and the $250 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior 2025 Notes. These increases were partially offset by lower interest rates on our variable-rate debt.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for fiscal 2020 increased $3 million to $9 million compared with $6 million during fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, our effective tax rate was 19.6% and 14.6%, respectively. The effective tax rate for each period reflects only the portion of net income that was attributable to the Blocker Companies, the impact of certain permanent book-tax differences and incremental tax expense due to our legal entity structure.\nNet Income\nNet income for fiscal 2020 increased $1 million, or 4.8%, to $37 million compared with $36 million during fiscal 2019. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to higher net sales, improved gross profit and lower discretionary spending, partially offset by higher SG&A and amortization expenses, primarily attributable to acquisitions, and increased interest expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2020 increased $44 million, or 14.9%, to $342 million compared with $298 million during fiscal 2019. Growth in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to higher net sales, improved gross profit and lower discretionary spending, partially offset by higher SG&A expense from acquisitions. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP financial metric, see -Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, we have financed our liquidity requirements through cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under our credit facilities, issuances of equity and debt securities and working capital management activities. Our principal historical liquidity requirements have been for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and servicing indebtedness.\nAs of January 30, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1 million and we had no outstanding borrowings on our Senior ABL Credit Facility, which provides for borrowings of up to $850 million, subject to borrowing base availability. As of January 30, 2022, after giving effect to approximately $9 million of letters of credit issued under the Senior ABL Credit Facility, Core & Main LP would have been able to borrow approximately $841 million under the Senior ABL Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base availability. Our short term debt obligations of $15 million are related to quarterly amortization principal payments on the Senior Term Loan Facility.\nIn connection with the IPO, we used the net proceeds of approximately $656 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and transaction costs directly attributable to the IPO, from the issuance of 34,883,721 shares of Class A common stock on July 27, 2021 to purchase an equivalent number of newly issued Partnership Interests from Holdings. In turn, Holdings and Core & Main LP used the net proceeds directly or indirectly received from us, together with the net proceeds from the Senior Term Loan Facility and cash on hand, to redeem all $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior 2024 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, at a redemption price equal to 102.000% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, to redeem all $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior 2025 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, at a redemption price equal to 101.531% of the aggregate principal amount thereof by satisfying and discharging the indenture governing the Senior 2025 Notes at the closing of the IPO and redeeming the Senior 2025 Notes on August 15, 2021, and to prepay $1,258 million outstanding under the Prior Term Loan Facility, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In connection with the IPO Overallotment Option Exercise, we used the net proceeds of approximately $100 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, from the issuance of 5,232,558 additional shares of Class A common stock on August 20, 2021 to purchase an equivalent number of newly issued Partnership Interests from Holdings. In turn, Holdings and Core & Main LP used the net proceeds directly or indirectly received from us for general corporate purposes.\nWe are required to make cash payments in future periods under the Tax Receivable Agreements. Payments to the Former Limited Partners are expected to commence in fiscal year 2023 and payments to the Continuing Limited Partner involved in the Secondary Offering are expected to commence in fiscal year 2024. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements are only required to be made to the extent that we utilize the corresponding tax deductions to reduce payments to federal, state and local taxing authorities. These payments are in an amount that represents 85% of the reduction in payments to federal, state and local taxing authorities. As such, the cash savings from the incremental tax deductions are expected to exceed the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements over the life of these arrangements. Based on the anticipated filing date of income tax returns and contractual payment terms in the Tax Receivable Agreements, we expect these payments to occur two fiscal years after we utilize the corresponding tax deductions. The timing of payments associated with the Tax Receivable Agreements are summarized below:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2022\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2023\n</td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2024\n</td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2025\n</td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2026\n</td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter </td> <td>116 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Tax Receivable Agreements liability </td> <td>$ </td> <td>153 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFurther exchanges by the Continuing Limited Partners will result in additional tax deductions to us and require additional payables pursuant to Tax Receivable Agreements. The actual amount and timing of the additional payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges by the holders of Partnership Interests, the amount of gain recognized by such holders of Partnership Interests, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future and the federal tax rates then applicable. Assuming (i) that the Continuing Limited Partners exchanged all of their remaining Partnership Interests at $23.45 per share of our Class A common stock (the closing stock price on January 28, 2022), (ii) no material changes in relevant tax law, (iii) a constant corporate tax rate of 25.1%, which represents a pro forma tax rate that includes a provision for U.S. federal income taxes and assumes the highest statutory rate apportioned to each state and local jurisdiction and (iv) that we earn sufficient taxable income in each year to realize on a current basis all tax benefits that are subject to the Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement, we would recognize a deferred tax asset (subject to offset with existing deferred tax liabilities) of approximately $653 million and a Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement liability of approximately $555 million, payable to the Continuing Limited Partners over the life of the Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement. The full exchange by the Continuing Limited Partners will also decrease Core & Main's aforementioned deferred tax asset associated with its investment in Holdings by $153 million. The increase in the deferred tax asset is less than what would be implied from the incremental liability for payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements, as the cash tax savings are driven by the increase in tax basis of the individual assets within Holdings compared with the tax basis of the Partnership Interests held by Core & Main. The basis increase of the Partnership Interests, as required under generally accepted accounting principles, is limited to the fair value of the Partnership Interests being exchanged. These amounts are estimates only and are subject to change.\nIn addition to making distributions to Core & Main, Inc. to fund tax obligations and payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements, in accordance with the Partnership Agreement, Holdings also makes distributions to the Continuing Limited Partners representing the non-controlling interests of Core & Main, Inc. to fund their income tax obligations with various taxing authorities. The amount of these payments are dependent upon various factors, including the amount of taxable income allocated to them from Holdings, changes in the ownership percentage of the non-controlling interest holders (which changes from the IPO and subsequent secondary offerings), changes in tax rates and the timing of distributions relative to the corresponding tax year. Tax distributions to non-controlling interest holders were $52 million in fiscal 2021. We expect, absent all other factors, for this amount to decrease due to timing of distributions and a smaller non-controlling interest ownership following the Reorganization Transactions, the IPO and the Secondary Offering.\nWe believe that our current sources of liquidity, which include cash generated from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under the Senior ABL Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash commitments, including obligations relating to our indebtedness and the Tax Receivable Agreements, over at least the next 12 months. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Our growth strategy contemplates future acquisitions for which we will need sufficient access to capital. To finance future acquisitions, particularly larger acquisitions, we may issue additional equity or incur additional indebtedness. Any such additional indebtedness would increase our debt leverage. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Indebtedness\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHoldings' ability to pay dividends may be limited as a practical matter by our growth plans as well as our credit agreements and other debt instruments insofar as we may seek to pay dividends out of funds made available to us by Core & Main LP, because our credit agreements directly or indirectly restrict Core & Main LP's ability to pay dividends or make loans to Holdings. The Senior Term Loan Facility may require accelerated repayment based upon cash flows generated in excess of operating and investing requirements when Core & Main LP's net total leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.25. In addition, the Senior ABL Credit Facility requires us to comply with a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of greater than or equal to 1.00 when availability is less than 10.0% of the lesser of (i) the then applicable borrowing base and (ii) the then aggregate effective commitments under the Senior ABL Credit Facility. Substantially all of Core & Main LP's assets secure the Senior Term Loan Facility and the Senior ABL Credit Facility.\nInformation about our cash flows, by category, is presented in the consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and is summarized as follows:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>January 30, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>January 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>February 2, 2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>194 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>(203) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(229) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(234) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>(146) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(380) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>144 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $31 million for fiscal 2021 compared with net cash from operating activities of $214 million for fiscal 2020. The change was primarily driven by a higher investment in working capital based on strong net sales growth, driven by inflation and volume growth, and strategic inventory purchases for fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2020, we had a lower investment in working capital due to the impacts of COVID-19. These factors were partially offset by higher gross profit driven in part by price inflation and volume growth. We expect cash interest payments for fiscal 2022 to be substantially lower than fiscal 2021 as the Senior 2024 Notes and Senior 2025 Notes are no longer outstanding.\nNet cash from operating activities for fiscal 2020 increased $20 million to $214 million compared with $194 million for fiscal 2019. The increase was attributable to higher gross profit, driven in part by the impact of acquisitions, and the deferral of $10 million in payroll taxes in fiscal 2020 in accordance with the CARES Act. Additionally, operating cash flows increased $15 million from fiscal 2019 due to certain up-front payments representing prepaid compensation associated with the LIP acquisition being accounted for as an operating activity. These increases were partially offset by net increase in cash interest payments of $24 million, higher SG&A expenses, driven in part by the impact of acquisitions, and a higher investment in working capital during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $26 million to $203 million for fiscal 2021 compared with $229 million for fiscal 2020. The decrease was attributable to a $38 million decrease in acquisitions partially offset by an $8 million increase in capital expenditures and a $5 million payment in fiscal 2021 for the settlement of an interest rate swap. Fiscal 2021 acquisitions included $104 million related to the Pacific Pipe Acquisition, $62 million related to the L&M Acquisition and $12 million related to Other 2021 Acquisitions. Fiscal 2020 included cash outflows of $206 million related to the R&B Acquisition and $11 million related to the WWSC Acquisition.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $5 million to $229 million in fiscal 2020 compared with $234 million in fiscal 2019, primarily attributable to a decrease in acquisition outflows and reduction in capital expenditures. Fiscal 2020 included outflows of $206 million and $11 million for the R&B and WWSC acquisitions, respectively, while fiscal 2019 included outflows of $200 million, $18 million and $2 million for the LIP, Maskell and other acquisitions, respectively.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $146 million for fiscal 2021 compared with net cash from financing activities of $215 million for fiscal 2020. The change of $361 million was primarily attributable to a $1,079 million increase in outflows for debt repayments, net of debt issuances, discounts, issuance costs, and modification costs, and a $37 million increase in distributions to non-controlling interest holders. The outflows were partially offset by net proceeds from the IPO and the IPO Overallotment Option Exercise of approximately $756 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses paid.\nNet cash from financing activities increased $31 million to $215 million during fiscal 2020 compared with $184 million during fiscal 2019, primarily attributable to a $296 million decline in distributions to partners, partially offset by a $266 million decrease in proceeds from debt issuances, net of discounts and issuance costs, and repayments. The decline in distributions was primarily attributable to a $290 million special distribution to equity holders of Holdings made during fiscal 2019 and a decrease of $6 million in tax-related distributions, primarily due to tax law changes under the CARES Act during fiscal 2020. The change in proceeds from the incurrence of debt reflects the issuance of $250 million aggregate principal amount of Senior 2024 Notes during fiscal 2020 compared with the additional $225 million borrowed under the Senior Term Loan Facility and the issuance of $300 million aggregate principal amount of Senior 2024 Notes during fiscal 2020.\nFinancing\nSenior Term Loan Facility\nCore & Main LP's Senior Term Loan Facility has an original aggregate principal amount of $1,500 million. The Senior Term Loan Facility requires quarterly principal payments, payable on the last business day of each fiscal quarter in an amount equal to approximately 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Senior Term Loan Facility. The Senior Term Loan Facility matures on July 27, 2028. The first quarterly principal payment was made on October 29, 2021. The remaining balance is payable upon final maturity of the Senior Term Loan Facility on July 27, 2028. The Senior Term Loan Facility bears interest at a rate equal to (i) LIBOR plus, in each case, an applicable margin of 2.50% or (ii) the base rate, which will be the highest of (x) the corporate base rate established by the administrative agent as its prime rate in effect at its principal office in New York City from time to time, (y) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum and (z) one-month LIBOR (adjusted for maximum reserves) plus 1.00% per annum, plus, in each case, an applicable margin of 1.50%. The Senior Term Loan Facility is subject to a LIBOR floor\u201d of 0.00%. The weighted average interest rate, excluding the effect of the interest rate swap, of Core & Main LP's outstanding borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility as of January 30, 2022 was 2.61%. Based on quotes from financial institutions (i.e., level 2 of the fair value hierarchy) the fair value of the Senior Term Loan Facility was $1,489 million at January 30, 2022.\nFor additional information related to the Senior Term Loan Facility, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAsset-Based Credit Facility\nCore & Main LP's Senior ABL Credit Facility has a borrowing capacity of up to $850 million, subject to borrowing base availability, with a maturity date of July 27, 2026. Borrowings under the Senior ABL Credit Facility bear interest at either a LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%, or an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%, depending on the borrowing capacity under the Senior ABL Credit Facility. Additionally, Core & Main LP pays a fee of 0.25% on unfunded commitments under the Senior ABL Credit Facility. The book value of the Senior ABL Credit Facility approximates fair value due to the variable interest rate nature of these borrowings. There were no amounts outstanding under the Senior ABL Credit Facility as of January 30, 2022.\nFor additional information related to the Senior ABL Credit Facility, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPrior Term Loan Facility\nCore & Main LP entered a senior term loan facility with a maturity date of August 1, 2024, with an original aggregate principal amount of $1,300 million. The Prior Term Loan Facility bore interest at either an adjusted LIBOR rate (subject to a minimum rate of 1.00%) plus an applicable margin of either 2.75% or 3.00%, or an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of either 1.75% or 2.00%, depending on Core & Main LP's Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio. During the periods that the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio is below 5.75, the Prior Term Loan's interest rate will be calculated using the lower applicable margins. On July 27, 2021, we repaid the $1,258 million outstanding under the Prior Term Loan Facility.\nSenior 2024 Notes\nOn September 16, 2019, Holdings issued the Senior 2024 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $300 million. The Senior 2024 Notes bore interest at 8.625% per annum. On July 27, 2021, we redeemed the Senior 2024 Notes including all $300 million aggregate principal and the $6 million redemption premium equal to 102.000% of the aggregate principal amount.\nSenior 2025 Notes\nOn August 1, 2017, Core & Main LP issued Senior 2025 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million, and on June 5, 2020, Core & Main LP issued Senior 2025 Notes with an additional aggregate principal amount of $250 million. The Senior 2025 Notes bore interest at 6.125% per annum. On July 27, 2021, we satisfied and discharged the indenture governing the Senior 2025 Notes, including all $750 million aggregate principal and the $12 million redemption premium equal to 101.531% of the aggregate principal amount, and on August 15, 2021, we redeemed the Senior 2025 Notes.\nPotential for Future Debt Repurchases\nWe may repurchase or otherwise retire our debt and take other steps to reduce our debt or otherwise improve our financial position. These actions could include open market debt repurchases, negotiated repurchases, other retirements of outstanding debt and opportunistic refinancing of debt. The amount of debt that may be repurchased or otherwise retired, if any, will depend on market conditions, trading levels of our debt, cash position, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations. Our affiliates may also purchase debt from time to time, through open market purchases or other transactions. In such cases, our debt may not be retired, in which case we would continue to pay interest in accordance with the terms of such debt, and we would continue to reflect the debt as outstanding in our consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInterest Rate Swap\nOn July 27, 2021, Core & Main LP entered into an interest rate swap in which it makes payments to a third-party based upon a fixed interest rate of 0.74% and receives payments based upon the one-month LIBOR rate, based on notional amounts associated with borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility. The measurement period of the instrument commenced on July 27, 2021 with a notional amount of $1,000 million. The notional amount decreases to $900 million on July 27, 2023, $800 million on July 27, 2024, and $700 million on July 27, 2025 through the instrument maturity on July 27, 2026. This instrument is intended to reduce our exposure to variable interest rates under the Senior Term Loan Facility. As of January 30, 2022, this instrument resulted in an effective fixed rate of 3.24%, based upon the 0.74% fixed rate plus an applicable margin of 2.50%, on $1,000 million of borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility.\nThe fair value of this cash flow interest rate swap was a $31 million asset as of January 30, 2022 which is included within other assets in the Balance Sheet. Fair value is based upon the present value of future cash flows under the terms of the contract and observable market inputs (level 2). Significant inputs used in determining fair value include forward looking one-month LIBOR rates and the discount rate applied to projected cash flows.\nPurchase Obligations\nAs of January 30, 2022, the Company had agreements in place with various suppliers to purchase goods and services, primarily inventory, in the aggregate amount of $1,511 million. These purchase obligations are generally cancelable, but the Company foresees no intent to cancel. Payment is generally expected to be made during fiscal 2022 for these obligations.\nLeases\nThe Company occupies certain facilities and operates certain equipment and vehicles under operating leases that expire at various dates through the year 2036. Future aggregate rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of January 30, 2022 were as follows: $51 million in fiscal 2022, $41 million in fiscal 2023, $30 million in fiscal 2024, $21 million in fiscal 2025, $13 million in fiscal 2026 and $16 million thereafter.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, we present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not considered measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and the items excluded therefrom are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance or liquidity. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to GAAP measures such as net income or net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc., as applicable, cash provided by or used in operating, investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in our financial statements as an indicator of our financial performance or liquidity.\nWe define EBITDA as net income, or net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc., as applicable, adjusted for non-controlling interests, depreciation and amortization, provision for income taxes and interest expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA as further adjusted for certain items management believes are not reflective of the underlying operations of our business, including (a) loss on debt modification and extinguishment, (b) equity-based compensation, (c) expenses associated with the IPO and subsequent secondary offerings and (d) expenses associated with acquisition activities. Net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess the operating results and effectiveness and efficiency of our business. Adjusted EBITDA includes amounts otherwise attributable to non-controlling interests as we manage the consolidated company and evaluate operating performance in a similar manner. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that investors consider them to be important supplemental measures of performance, and we believe that these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Non-GAAP financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics reported by other companies and may not be calculated in the same manner. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n\u2022 do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt;\n\u2022 do not reflect income tax expenses, the cash requirements to pay taxes or related distributions;\n\u2022 do not reflect cash requirements to replace in the future any assets being depreciated and amortized; and\n\u2022 exclude certain transactions or expenses as allowed by the various agreements governing our indebtedness.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not alternative measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and therefore should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. and other performance measures such as gross profit or net cash provided by or used in operating, investing or financing activities and not as alternatives to such GAAP measures. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that, in the future, we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income or net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>January 30, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>January 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>February 2, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: net income attributable to non-controlling interests </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>284 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on debt modification and extinguishment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity-based compensation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition expenses (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offering expenses (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>298 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes depreciation of certain assets which are reflected in cost of sales\u201d in our Statement of Operations.\n(2)Represents expenses associated with acquisition activities, including transaction costs, post-acquisition employee retention bonuses, severance payments, expense recognition of purchase accounting fair value adjustments (excluding amortization) and contingent consideration adjustments.\n(3)Represents costs related to the IPO and Secondary Offering reflected in SG&A expenses in our Statement of Operations.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nA summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 of our audited consolidated annual financial statements. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and changes in the business environment. However, actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management judgment. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are earned from contracts with customers. These contracts include written agreements and purchase orders as well as arrangements that are implied by customary business practices or law. The revenue contracts are primarily single performance obligations for the sale of product or performance of services for customers. Revenue is recognized when title is passed to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the products and services, which is net of sales tax, customer incentives, returns and discounts. For product sales, the transfer of title generally occurs at the point of destination for products shipped by internal fleet and at the point of shipping for products shipped by third-party carriers. Estimates for expected customer incentives, returns and discounts are based on historical experience, anticipated performance and management's judgment. Generally, our contracts do not contain significant financing as the standard sales terms are short term in nature.\nInventories\nInventories consist primarily of finished goods and are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of substantially all inventories is determined by the weighted average cost method. We evaluate our inventory value at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This evaluation includes an analysis of historical physical inventory results and a review of potential excess and obsolete inventories based on inventory aging and anticipated future demand. Periodically, perpetual inventory records are adjusted to reflect any declines in net realizable value below inventory carrying cost. To the extent historical physical inventory results are not indicative of future results and if future events impact, either favorably or unfavorably, the salability of our products or our relationship with certain key suppliers, our inventory reserves could differ significantly, resulting in either higher or lower future inventory provisions. The carrying value of inventory includes the capitalization of inbound freight costs and is net of supplier rebates and purchase discounts for products not yet sold.\nConsideration Received from Suppliers\nWe enter into agreements with many of our suppliers providing for inventory purchase rebates ( supplier rebates\u201d) upon achievement of specified volume purchasing levels and purchase discounts. We accrue the receipt of supplier rebates and purchase discounts as part of our cost of sales for products sold based on progress towards earning the supplier rebates, taking into consideration cumulative purchases of inventory to the measurement date and projected purchases through the end of the year. An estimate of supplier rebates and purchase discounts is included in the carrying value of inventory at each period end for supplier rebates to be received on products not yet sold. While we believe we will continue to receive consideration from suppliers in fiscal 2022 and thereafter, there can be no assurance that suppliers will continue to provide comparable amounts of supplier rebates in the future.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangibles, are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Management periodically assesses for triggering events and discusses any significant changes in the utilization of long-lived assets, which may result from, but are not limited to, an adverse change in the asset's physical condition or a significant adverse change in the business climate. To analyze recoverability, we project undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the asset. If these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset less any costs of disposition. Our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market and operational performance. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets are impaired. Evaluating the impairment also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows that require judgment by management. If different estimates were used, the amount and timing of asset impairments could be affected.\nGoodwill\nIn performing goodwill assessments, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated. During the fiscal 2021 annual assessment, we tested goodwill for impairment by performing a quantitative assessment that compared the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. We determined the fair value of our reporting unit through a combination of an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows and a market approach based on the sales and EBITDA multiples from operations and purchase transaction of comparable companies. Determining fair value in the income approach required utilization of the significant assumption of gross margin. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis were based on our long-range forecasts and an estimated terminal value. The discount rate used in the discounted cash flow analysis was intended to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. For the market approach, we evaluated comparable company public trading values and recent transactions, using EBITDA multiples and sales multiples that were used to value the reporting unit.\nWe test goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. When the book value exceeds the fair value of the goodwill, we record an impairment charge equal to this difference.\nAcquisitions\nWe enter into acquisitions to strategically expand in underpenetrated products and markets. When we acquire a business or assets that are determined to meet the definition of a business, we allocate the purchase consideration paid to acquire the business to the assets and liabilities acquired based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. If during the measurement period (a period not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date) we receive additional information that existed as of the acquisition date but at the time of the original allocation described above was unknown to us, we make the appropriate adjustments to the purchase price allocation in the reporting period that the amounts are determined.\nFor each acquisition, we value intangible assets acquired which may include customer relationships, non-compete agreements and/or trademarks. Customer relationship intangible assets represent the value associated with those customer relationships in place at the date of the acquisition. We value customer relationships using an excess earnings method using various inputs such as customer attrition rate, revenue growth rate, gross margin percentage and discount rate. Cash flows associated with the existing relationships are expected to diminish over time due to customer turnover. We reflect this expected diminishing cash flow through the utilization of an annual customer attrition rate assumption and in its method of amortization. Non-compete intangible assets represent the value associated with non-compete agreements for former executives in place at the date of the acquisition. Trademark intangible assets represent the value associated with the brand names in place at the date of the acquisition.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a result of the Reorganization Transactions, Core & Main became the general partner of Holdings, which is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax purposes. As a partnership, Holdings is generally not subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local income taxes. Any taxable income or loss from Holdings is passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its partners, including Core & Main, following the Reorganization Transactions. Core & Main is subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes, with respect to Core & Main's allocable share of any taxable income or loss of Holdings following the Reorganization Transactions.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If it is determined that the Company is not able to realize deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance would be established, which would impact the provision for income taxes.\nUncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) it is determined if a tax position is more-likely-than-not of being sustained on the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes in the audited Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nTax Receivable Agreements\nUnder the Tax Receivable Agreements, we expect to generate tax attributes that will reduce amounts that we would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities.\nThe Former Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement provides for the payment by us to certain Former Limited Partners, or their permitted transferees, of 85% of the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) certain tax attributes of the Partnership Interests we hold in respect of such Former Limited Partners' interest in us, including such attributes which resulted from such Former Limited Partners' prior acquisition of ownership interests in Holdings and our allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in connection with the IPO attributable to the Former Limited Partners and (ii) certain other tax benefits.\nThe Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement provides for the payment by us to the Continuing Limited Partners, or their permitted transferees, of 85% of the benefits, if any, that we realize, or in some circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) increases in tax basis or other similar tax benefits as a result of exchanges of Partnership Interests for cash or shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, dated as of July 22, 2021 (the Exchange Agreement\u201d), by and among Core & Main, Holdings, CD&R Waterworks Holdings, LLC and Management Feeder, (ii) our allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in connection with the IPO attributable to the Continuing Limited Partners and in connection with exchanges of Partnership Interests for cash or shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement and (iii) our utilization of certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement. We expect to obtain an increase in our share of the tax basis in the net assets of Holdings as Partnership Interests are exchanged by Continuing Limited Partners. We intend to treat any exchanges of Partnership Interests as direct purchases of Partnership Interests for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These increases in tax basis are expected to reduce amounts owed to various tax authorities in the future.\nExcept to the extent that any benefits are deemed realized, we will receive the full benefit in tax savings from relevant taxing authorities and provide payment of 85% of the amount of any of our actual or deemed tax benefits to the Former Limited Partners or Continuing Limited Partners, as applicable, or their permitted transferees. We expect to benefit from the remaining 15% of any cash tax savings, except to the extent of any deemed realizations. For the Tax Receivable Agreements, we assess the tax attributes to determine if it is more likely than not that the benefit of any deferred tax assets will be realized. Following that assessment, we recognize a liability under the applicable Tax Receivable Agreements, reflecting approximately 85% of the expected future realization of such tax benefits. Amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreements are contingent upon, among other things, (i) generation of sufficient future taxable income during the term of the applicable Tax Receivable Agreements and (ii) future changes in tax laws. The establishment of the $92 million liability under the Former Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreements and the $61 million liability under the Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreements as of January 30, 2022 did not impact earnings as the payments were recorded against equity since Core & Main entered into the Tax Receivable Agreements as part of common control transactions.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of January 30, 2022.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a number of important factors, particularly those described under the caption Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a leading specialized distributor of water, wastewater, storm drainage and fire protection products and related services to municipalities, private water companies and professional contractors across municipal, non-residential and residential end markets nationwide. Our specialty products and services are used in the maintenance, repair, replacement, and construction of water and fire protection infrastructure. We reach customers through a nationwide network of approximately 300 branches across 48 states. Our products include pipes, valves, fittings, storm drainage products, fire protection products, meter products and other products for use in the construction, maintenance and repair of water and waste-water systems as well as fire protection systems. We complemented our core products through additional offerings, including smart meter systems, fusible high-density polyethylene ( fusible HDPE\u201d) piping solutions and specifically engineered treatment plant products, services and geosynthetics used in erosion control. Our services and capabilities allow for integration with customers and form part of their sourcing and procurement function.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Company is a holding company and its sole material asset is its direct and indirect ownership interest in Holdings. Holdings has no operations and no material assets of its own other than its indirect ownership interest in Core & Main LP, a Florida limited partnership, the legal entity that conducts the operations of Core & Main. Because Core & Main is the general partner of Holdings, it operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Holdings and, through Holdings and its subsidiaries, conducts our business. Accordingly, the consolidated financial information of Core & Main presented herein, including the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, includes the consolidated financial information of Holdings and its subsidiaries. The ownership interest of the Continuing Limited Partners related to Partnership Interests held by the Continuing Limited Partners is reflected as non-controlling interests in Core & Main's consolidated financial statements.\nAs the Reorganization Transactions (as defined below under -Significant Events During Fiscal 2021\u201d) are accounted for as transactions between entities under common control, the financial statements for the periods prior to our IPO and Reorganization Transactions have been adjusted to combine previously separate entities for presentation purposes. These entities include Core & Main, Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries and the Blocker Companies (as defined below under -Significant Events During Fiscal 2021\u201d). Prior to the Reorganization Transactions, Core & Main had no operations.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31st. Quarters within the fiscal year include 13-week periods, unless a fiscal year includes a 53rd week, in which case the fourth quarter of the fiscal year will be a 14-week period. The fiscal years ended January 30, 2022, January 31, 2021 and February 2, 2020 included 52 weeks. The next fiscal year ending January 29, 2023 ( fiscal 2022\u201d) will also include 52 weeks.\nSignificant Events During Fiscal 2021\nInitial Public Offering\nCore & Main is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on April 9, 2021 for the purpose of facilitating our IPO and other related transactions, as described below, in order to carry on the business of Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries. On July 27, 2021, we completed our initial public offering of 34,883,721 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $20.00 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $664 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. All of the net proceeds from the IPO, less $8 million of transaction costs directly attributable to the IPO, were utilized to purchase 34,883,721 newly issued Partnership Interests of Holdings for approximately $656 million in the aggregate. In turn, Holdings and Core & Main LP utilized the net proceeds from the IPO directly or indirectly received from Core & Main in the Refinancing Transactions (as defined and described under -Refinancing Transactions.\u201d)\nOn August 20, 2021, we issued 5,232,558 shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock in connection with the IPO at the initial public offering price of $20.00 per share before underwriting discounts and commissions (the IPO Overallotment Option Exercise\u201d). We received net proceeds of approximately $100 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. All of the net proceeds were utilized to purchase 5,232,558 newly issued Partnership Interests of Holdings at a price per unit equal to the public offering price per share less underwriting discounts and commissions. In turn, Holdings and Core & Main LP utilized the net proceeds received directly or indirectly from Core & Main for general corporate purposes.\nSecondary Offering\nOn January 10, 2022, a secondary public offering of 20,000,000 shares of Class A common stock by certain selling stockholders affiliated with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (the Selling Stockholders\u201d) was completed at a price to the public of $26.00 per share (the Secondary Offering\u201d). As part of the Secondary Offering, 7,455,242 Partnership Interests were exchanged, together with the retirement of a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock, for an equal number of shares of Class A common stock, which were a portion of the shares sold by the Selling Stockholders. These shares were sold along with an existing 12,544,758 shares of Class A common stock held by the Selling Stockholders. The Company did not sell any shares of Class A common stock in the Secondary Offering and did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale. The Company paid the costs associated with the sale of shares by the Selling Stockholders, other than the underwriting discounts and commissions.\nReorganization Transactions\nIn connection with the IPO, we completed the following transactions (collectively the Reorganization Transactions\u201d):\n\u2022the formation of Core & Main as a Delaware corporation to function as the direct and indirect parent of Holdings and a publicly traded entity;\n\u2022the amendment and restatement of the limited partnership agreement of Holdings to, among other things first, modify the capital structure of Holdings and second, admit Core & Main as the general partner and a limited partner of Holdings;\n\u2022Core & Main's acquisition of the Partnership Interests held by certain Former Limited Partners (as defined below) and the issuance of Class A common stock to the Former Limited Partners, pursuant to the mergers of CD&R WW Advisor, LLC and CD&R WW Holdings, LLC (the Blocker Companies\u201d) with and into Core & Main via merger subsidiaries of Core & Main (the Blocker Mergers\u201d); and\n\u2022entry into a Master Reorganization Agreement, dated as of July 22, 2021 (the Master Reorganization Agreement\u201d) with Holdings, the Continuing Limited Partners, the Blocker Companies, CD&R Waterworks Holdings GP, CD&R Associates X Waterworks, L.P., CD&R WW Holdings, L.P., Core & Main GP, LLC, CD&R Plumb Buyer, LLC, CD&R Fund X Advisor Waterworks B, L.P., CD&R Fund X Waterworks B1, L.P., CD&R Fund X-A Waterworks B, L.P., CD&R WW, LLC, Brooks Merger Sub 1, Inc. and Brooks Merger Sub 2, Inc. Pursuant to the Master Reorganization Agreement, the Former Limited Partners received Partnership Interests in exchange for their existing indirect ownership interests in Holdings and exchanged these Partnership Interests for shares of Class A common stock of Core & Main prior to the consummation of the IPO.\nThe Former Limited Partners are defined as CD&R Fund X Advisor Waterworks B, L.P., CD&R Fund X Waterworks B1, L.P., CD&R Fund X-A Waterworks B, L.P. and the other Original Limited Partners (as defined below) that transferred all or a portion of their Partnership Interests (including those held indirectly through the Blocker Companies) for shares of Class A common stock in connection with the Reorganization Transactions and the IPO, and represent entities that transferred all of their Partnership Interests (including Partnership Interests held indirectly through certain blocker\u201d corporations) for shares of Class A common stock in connection with the consummation of the Reorganization Transactions.\nThe Continuing Limited Partners are defined as CD&R Waterworks Holdings, LLC ( CD&R Waterworks Holdings\u201d) and Core & Main Management Feeder, LLC ( Management Feeder\u201d), and represent the Original Limited Partners that continued to own Partnership Interests after the Reorganization Transactions and that are entitled to exchange their Partnership Interests, together with the retirement of a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock, for shares of Class A common stock.\nThe Original Limited Partners are defined as CD&R Waterworks Holdings, the Former Limited Partners and Management Feeder and represent the direct and indirect owners of Holdings prior to the Reorganization Transactions and the IPO.\nImmediately following and as a result of the IPO, Reorganization Transactions and Secondary Offering:\n\u2022the shareholders of Core & Main, excluding the Continuing Limited Partners and the Former Limited Partners, collectively held 60,116,279 shares of Class A common stock consisting of 34,883,721 shares issued in the IPO, 5,232,558 shares issued pursuant to the IPO Overallotment Option Exercise on August 20, 2021 and 20,000,000 shares sold in the Secondary Offering on January 10, 2022;\n\u2022the Former Limited Partners collectively held 107,397,971 shares of Class A common stock;\n\u2022Core & Main, directly or indirectly through our wholly-owned subsidiary, held 167,522,403 Partnership Interests consisting of 154,834,603 Partnership Interests issued pursuant to the Reorganization Transactions and IPO, 5,232,558 Partnership Interests issued pursuant to the IPO Overallotment Option Exercise on August 20, 2021 and 7,455,242 Partnership Interests received in connection with the exchange of Partnership Interests, together with the retirement of a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock, for an equal number of shares of Class A common stock in the Secondary Offering; and\n\u2022the Continuing Limited Partners collectively held 8,153 shares of Class A common stock, 78,398,141 Partnership Interests and 78,398,141 shares of Class B common stock.\nRefinancing Transactions\nOn July 27, 2021, Core & Main LP: (i) amended the terms of the credit agreement governing the senior term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1,300 million maturing on August 1, 2024 issued by Core & Main LP (the Prior Term Loan Facility\u201d) in order to, among other things, enter into a new $1,500 million seven-year senior term loan (the Senior Term Loan Facility\u201d) and (ii) amended the terms of the credit agreement governing the senior asset-based revolving credit facility in order to, among other things, increase the aggregate amount of commitments by $150 million to $850 million overall and extend the maturity date from July 2024 to July 2026 (as amended, the Senior ABL Credit Facility\u201d). Core & Main LP and Holdings utilized the net proceeds from the IPO, together with the net proceeds from borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility and cash on hand, to redeem (i) all $300 million aggregate principal amount of the senior unsecured notes due September 15, 2024 issued by Holdings (the Senior 2024 Notes\u201d) then outstanding at a redemption price equal to 102.000% of the aggregate principal amount thereof and (ii) all $750 million aggregate principal amount of the senior unsecured notes due August 15, 2025 issued by Core & Main LP (the Senior 2025 Notes\u201d) then outstanding at a redemption price equal to 101.531% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, by satisfying and discharging the indenture governing the Senior 2025 Notes at the closing of the IPO and redeeming the Senior 2025 Notes on August 15, 2021. Additionally, Core & Main LP repaid $1,258 million outstanding under the Prior Term Loan Facility, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and settled the interest rate swap associated with the Prior Term Loan Facility (collectively, the Refinancing Transactions\u201d).\nPublic Company Costs\nIn connection with the IPO, we incurred one-time costs of approximately $11 million. We recorded $8 million as a reduction to additional paid in capital during fiscal 2021. Additionally, we recorded $3 million within selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2021.\nFollowing the IPO, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not previously incur, including costs associated with public company director and officer liability insurance, SEC reporting and corporate governance requirements, which expenses we estimate to be approximately $10 million annually on an ongoing basis. These requirements include compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Our financial statements for the periods following the IPO reflect the impact of these expenses\nPost-Offering Taxation and Expenses\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income of Holdings and will be taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates.\nIn connection with the Reorganization Transactions and the IPO, we entered into the Former Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement and the Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement. Prior and future exchanges of Partnership Interests in Holdings are expected to be treated as direct purchases of Partnership Interests for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which will result in increased deferred tax basis. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amounts that we would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities. We will receive the full benefit in tax savings and under the Tax Receivable Agreements will provide payment of 85% of the amount of any tax benefits we actually realize to the Former Limited Partners or the Continuing Limited Partners, as applicable, or their permitted transferees. We expect to benefit from the remaining 15% of any cash savings that we realize. Amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreements are contingent upon, among other things, (i) generation of sufficient future taxable income during the term of the Tax Receivable Agreements and (ii) future changes in tax laws. We intend to cause Holdings to make distributions to us in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay our tax obligations and to fund any payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreements.\nHistorically, Holdings has also made distributions to its non-controlling interests partners to fund their obligations to various taxing authorities. Following the Reorganization Transactions, Holdings expects to continue making distributions based on Partnership Interests, including distributions to us.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Business\nEnd-Markets and General Economic Conditions\nHistorically, demand for our products has been closely tied to municipal infrastructure spending, residential construction and non-residential construction in the U.S. We estimate that, based on fiscal 2021 net sales, our exposure by end market was approximately 39% municipal, 39% non-residential and 22% residential. Infrastructure spending and the non-residential and residential construction markets are subject to cyclical market pressures. Municipal demand has been relatively steady over the long term due to the consistent and immediate need to replace broken infrastructure, however activity levels are subject to the availability of funding for municipal projects. Non-residential and residential construction activities are primarily driven by availability of credit, interest rates, general economic conditions, consumer confidence and other factors that are beyond our control. The length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by market. Cyclicality can also have an impact on the products we procure for our customers or our related services, as further discussed under -Price Fluctuations\u201d below.\nIn November 2021, President Biden signed into law the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\u201d), which includes $55 billion to invest in water infrastructure across the United States. In the coming years, including as a result of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, we expect increased federal infrastructure investment to have a core focus on the upgrade, repair and replacement of municipal waterworks systems and to address demographic shifts and serve the growing population. We believe these dynamics create the backdrop for a favorable funding environment and accelerated investment in projects that will benefit our business.\nSeasonality\nOur operating results within a fiscal year are typically impacted by seasonality. Although weather patterns affect our operating results throughout the year, adverse winter weather historically has reduced construction, maintenance and repair activity. As a result, net sales are typically lower in our first and fourth fiscal quarters, especially in northern geographic regions. Abnormal levels of precipitation may negatively impact our operating results as it may result in the delay of construction projects. Our operating results may also be adversely affected by hurricanes, which typically occur during our third fiscal quarter. Our cash flows from operating activities are typically lower during the first and second fiscal quarters due to investment in working capital and annual incentive compensation payments and are typically higher during the third and fourth fiscal quarters due to cash inflows associated with receivable collections and reduced inventory purchases.\nPrice Fluctuations\nOur financial performance is impacted by price fluctuations in commodity-based products and our ability to reflect these changes, in a timely manner, in our customer pricing. Such commodity-based products include PVC, ductile iron, fusible HDPE and steel and copper pipe and tubing products, which accounted for approximately 32%, 24%, and 26% of our net sales in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019, respectively.\nWe are also exposed to fluctuations in costs for petroleum as we distribute a substantial portion of our products by truck. Petroleum prices have recently experienced significant increases as a result of the conflict in Ukraine. In addition, we are exposed to fluctuations in prices for imported products due to logistical challenges and changes in labor, fuel, container and other importation-related costs. We may also face price fluctuations on other products due to constrained labor availability and manufacturing capacity. Our ability to reflect these changes, in a timely manner, in our customer pricing may impact our financial performance.\nIf we are able to pass through price increases to our customers, our net sales will increase; conversely, during periods of deflation, our customer pricing may decrease to remain competitive, resulting in decreased net sales. The cost to procure the products we sell are historically volatile and subject to fluctuations arising from changes in supply and demand, national and international economic conditions, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulation, weather events, trade policies and periodic delays in the delivery of our products. Certain commodity-based products have recently experienced price inflation due to a decline in supply related to impacts of adverse weather conditions and other factors. During fiscal 2021, we experienced significant price inflation in respect of certain of our commodity-based products as well as other product categories, and supply chain, which we expect to continue to experience in the near-term and have sought to mitigate through inventory management, effective sourcing and customer pricing. Over the course of fiscal 2021, we experienced increasing pressure on our supply chain due to several factors, including, but not limited to, delays from our suppliers, labor availability, global logistics and the availability of raw materials, in part due to the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy that limited product availability and further exacerbated the effects of inflation. For example, access to certain meter products that we sell is dependent on the ability of our suppliers to obtain semi-conductor chips. The global supply shortage of semi-conductor chips has impacted various industries and companies, including us, and there is no certainty as to when availability will return to historic levels. As we have experienced significant inflation over a relatively short period, there is increased risk that we may experience a higher level of deflation or substantially lower net sales growth than in recent periods to the extent there are improvements in the availability of labor, transportation and products.\nInterest Rates\nCertain of our indebtedness, including borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility and the Senior ABL Credit Facility, are subject to variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase and our net income would decrease, even though the amount borrowed under the facilities remained the same. As of January 30, 2022, we had $1,493 million of outstanding variable-rate debt. We seek to mitigate our exposure to interest rate volatility through the entry into interest rate swap instruments, such as our current interest rate swap that effectively converts $1,000 million of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt, which notional amount decreases to $900 million on July 27, 2023, $800 million on July 27, 2024, and $700 million on July 27, 2025 through the instrument maturity on July 27, 2026. Despite these efforts, unfavorable movement in interest rates may result in higher interest expense and cash payments.\nAcquisitions\nIn addition to our organic growth strategy, we opportunistically pursue strategic asset and business acquisitions to grow our business. Below is a summary of the acquisitions that closed in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 and the related transaction value (in each case, excluding working capital and other purchase price adjustments, unless otherwise noted).\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Name </td> <td> </td> <td>Product Lines </td> <td> </td> <td>Closing Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Transaction Value\n(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> L&M Bag & Supply Co., Inc.

There can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions will be realized on the timeline we expect, or at all.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nGovernmental authorities nationally and in affected regions have responded (and continue to respond) to COVID-19 and related variants by mandating various restrictions in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. We have continued to operate as an essential business, providing products and services to our customers that they need to invest in and maintain our nation's infrastructure. We have implemented preparedness plans to help keep our team safe while we work, including new physical distancing processes and procedures, associate quarantine procedures, expanded work from home\u201d protocols and the use of additional personal protective equipment. Despite certain temporary branch closures during fiscal 2020 and the first quarter of fiscal 2021, all of our facilities currently are operational and able to fill orders, and our teams have worked effectively to address the few temporary closures we have experienced.\nThe public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the related government measures taken in response, have adversely affected (and could continue to adversely affect) some of the markets in which we operate. We experienced reduced demand for our products in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2020, and in response we deferred non-essential capital expenditures and other discretionary spending and temporarily paused acquisition-related activities, though we have since resumed these activities. In addition, the ability of certain of our associates to travel or otherwise perform their jobs was restricted and the ability of our customers to travel, conduct their business and pay or otherwise access credit was impaired. Following these government-instituted restrictions, we experienced temporary delays in certain construction and infrastructure projects primarily during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Our business stabilized during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as the substantial majority of construction and infrastructure activities resumed and sales volume returned to near pre-pandemic levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2021, we experienced supply chain disruptions related to COVID-19 and other supply chain constraints in certain product categories, including meters, and we expect to continue facing further supply chain disruptions as a result of the ongoing and dynamic COVID-19 pandemic. Over the course of fiscal 2021, we experienced increasing pressure on our supply chain due to several factors, including, but not limited to, delays from our suppliers, labor availability, global logistics and availability of raw materials that are in part due to the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy. Depending on the ultimate scope and duration of supply chain disruptions, we may experience increases in product costs which we may not be able to pass on to our customers, loss of sales due to lack of product availability or potential customer claims from the inability to provide products in accordance with contractual terms. We continue to proactively monitor the situation and our supply chain and assess further possible implications to our business.\nCARES Act\nOn March 27, 2020, the U.S. federal government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d). The CARES Act allowed for the deferral of the employer share of social security taxes for the period from March 27, 2020 through December 31, 2020, which improved cash flows from operating activities by $10 million for fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021, the Company had an operating cash outflow related to the payment of $5 million of the deferred payroll taxes. As of January 30, 2022, we have deferred payment of $5 million in employer share of social security taxes in accordance with the CARES Act that are required to be repaid by December 31, 2022. The payment of the deferred payroll taxes of $5 million in fiscal 2022 is expected to result in additional operating cash outflows during this period.\nThe CARES Act also modified certain provisions in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d) , including provisions regarding interest deductibility. For fiscal 2020, these changes did not materially impact our results of operations but did result in improved operating and financing cash flows. The expiration of certain CARES Act provisions with respect to the Code resulted in increased partner distributions by Holdings and tax payments by Core & Main in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020.\nKey Business Metrics\nNet Sales\nWe generate net sales primarily from the sale of water, wastewater, storm drainage and fire protection products and the provision of related services to approximately 60,000 customers, as of January 30, 2022, including municipalities, private water companies and professional contractors. We recognize sales, net of sales tax, customer incentives, returns and discounts. Net sales fluctuate as a result of changes in commodity-based product costs and tariffs. We seek to reflect these changes in our customer pricing in a timely manner, which will increase net sales if we are able to pass along price increases and decrease net sales if we are required to reduce our customer prices as a result of competitive dynamics.\nWe categorize our net sales into pipes, valves & fittings, storm drainage products, fire protection products and meter products:\n\u2022Pipe, valves, hydrants, fittings include these products and other complementary products and services. Pipe includes PVC, ductile iron, fusible HDPE, steel and copper tubing.\n\u2022Storm drainage products primarily include corrugated piping systems, retention basins, manholes, grates, geosynthetics used in erosion control and other related products.\n\u2022Fire protection products primarily include fire protection pipe, sprinkler heads and devices as well as custom fabrication services.\n\u2022Meter products primarily include smart meter products, installation, software and other services.\nGross Profit\nGross profit represents the difference between the product cost from suppliers (net of earned rebates and discounts and including the cost of inbound freight) and the net sale price to our customers. Gross profit may be impacted by the time between changes in supplier costs and tariffs and changes in our customer pricing. Gross profit may not be comparable to those of other companies, as other companies may include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses are primarily comprised of selling, general and administrative costs, which include personnel expenses (salaries, wages, incentive compensation, associate benefits and payroll taxes), rent, insurance, utilities, professional fees, freight out, fuel and repair and maintenance.\nNet Income\nNet income represents our net sales less our cost of sales, operating expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other expense and our provision for income taxes for Core & Main and the consolidation of Holdings and its subsidiaries.\nNet Income Attributable to Core & Main, Inc.\nNet income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. represents net income less income attributable to non-controlling interests. Non-controlling interests represent owners of Partnership Interests of Holdings other than Core & Main.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted for certain items management believes are not reflective of the underlying operations of our business, including (a) loss on debt modification and extinguishment, (b) equity-based compensation, (c) expenses associated with the IPO and subsequent secondary offerings and (d) expenses associated with acquisition activities. Adjusted EBITDA includes amounts otherwise attributable to non-controlling interests as we manage the consolidated company and evaluate operating performance in a similar manner. We use Adjusted EBITDA to assess the operating results and effectiveness of our business.

The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to higher average selling prices, representing approximately half of the net sales increase, strong market volume growth and share gains resulting from sales initiatives and preferred access to products during a period of material shortages, which helped drive growth across all product lines. Net sales growth for pipes, valves & fittings and storm drainage products benefited from end-market growth, acquisitions and higher average selling prices. Net sales growth for fire protection products also benefited from end-market growth and higher average selling prices. Net sales of meter products grew at a slower pace, relative to other product lines, primarily due to shortages of semi-conductor chips that are components of certain smart meter products.\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>January 30, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>January 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pipes, valves & fittings products\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Storm drainage products\n</td> <td>687 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fire protection products\n</td> <td>565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Meter products\n</td> <td>391 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit\nGross profit for fiscal 2021 increased $402 million, or 45.8%, to $1,280 million compared with $878 million for fiscal 2020. The increase in net sales contributed an additional $328 million of gross profit and the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales contributed $74 million. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2021 was 25.6% compared with 24.1% for fiscal 2020. The overall increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to strategic inventory investments ahead of announced price increases, a favorable pricing environment, the execution of our gross margin initiatives, achievement of growth based supplier incentives and accretive acquisitions.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses for fiscal 2021 increased $161 million, or 29.0%, to $717 million compared with $556 million during fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $101 million in personnel expenses, which was primarily driven by higher variable compensation costs and increased headcount, lower discretionary spending in response to COVID-19 in fiscal 2020, a volume driven increase in distribution costs and incremental costs from acquisitions. In addition, during fiscal 2021, SG&A expenses increased by $21 million related to higher equity-based compensation expense, primarily due to accounting for equity awards, and $5 million of other one-time costs in connection with the IPO and Secondary Offering. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was 14.3% for fiscal 2021 compared with 15.3% for fiscal 2020. The decrease was attributable to our ability to leverage our fixed costs, partially offset by higher equity-based compensation.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization ( D&A\u201d) expense for fiscal 2021 was $138 million compared with $137 million during fiscal 2020. The increase primarily was attributable to amortization related to the Pacific Pipe and L&M acquisitions, partially offset by lower amortization on existing customer relationship intangible assets.\nOperating Income\nOperating income for fiscal 2021 was $425 million compared with $185 million during fiscal 2020. The increase in operating income was attributable to higher net sales and gross profit, primarily from volume growth, price inflation, and acquisitions. These factors were partially offset by higher SG&A expenses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $98 million for fiscal 2021 compared with $139 million for fiscal 2020. The decrease was attributable to the redemption of the Senior 2024 Notes, the redemption of the Senior 2025 Notes and lower interest rates on the Senior Term Loan Facility as compared to the Prior Term Loan Facility due to the Refinancing Transactions completed on July 27, 2021.\nLoss on Debt Modification and Extinguishment\nFor fiscal 2021, we recognized a loss on debt modification and extinguishment of $51 million. The loss on debt modification and extinguishment included (i) a write off of $8 million in deferred financing fees associated with the redemption of the Senior 2024 Notes, (ii) a write off of $13 million in deferred financing fees associated with the redemption of the Senior 2025 Notes, (iii) a write off of $5 million in deferred financing fees associated with the settlement of the Prior Term Loan Facility, (iv) redemption premiums of $6 million and $12 million for the Senior 2024 Notes and Senior 2025 Notes, respectively, (v) the settlement of the cash flow interest rate swap of $5 million which had its changes in fair value previously attributed to accumulated other comprehensive loss, and (vi) third-party expenses for the Senior Term Loan Facility of $2 million.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for fiscal 2021 increased $42 million to $51 million compared with $9 million for fiscal 2020. For fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, our effective tax rates were 18.5% and 19.6%, respectively. The effective tax rate for each period reflects only the portion of net income that is attributable to taxable entities (which are comprised of Core & Main following the Reorganization Transactions and the Blocker Companies before the Reorganization Transactions), the impact of certain permanent book-tax differences and incremental tax expense due to our legal entity structure. The effective tax rates in fiscal 2021 were lower than fiscal 2020 due to certain fixed tax expenses and permanent differences decreasing as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes.\nNet Income\nNet income for fiscal 2021 increased $188 million to $225 million compared with $37 million for fiscal 2020. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to higher operating income and lower interest expense due to the Refinancing Transactions, partially offset by the $51 million loss on debt modification and an increase in income taxes.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests for fiscal 2021 was $59 million. This represents the allocation of the Holdings' net income for the period from July 23, 2021 through January 30, 2022, which included the $51 million loss on debt modification and extinguishment, to holders of Partnership Interests other than Core & Main.\nNet Income Attributable to Core & Main, Inc.\nNet income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. for fiscal 2021 was $166 million. The net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. includes the net income of Holdings for the period from February 1, 2021 to July 22, 2021.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Class A common stock basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2021 were $0.57 and $0.55, respectively. The Class A common stock basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share were calculated for the period from July 23, 2021 through January 30, 2022, the period following the Reorganization Transactions, which included the $51 million loss on debt modification and extinguishment.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2021 increased $262 million, or 76.6%, to $604 million compared with $342 million for fiscal 2020. Growth in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to higher net sales and improved gross profit margins.

The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to growth from the R&B acquisition in March 2020, which primarily impacted sales of pipes, valves & fittings and storm drainage products. The LIP acquisition in July 2019 was the primary driver of growth of the fire protection products. In addition, higher average selling prices drove approximately 2% of overall net sales growth. These increases were partially offset by a volume decline of approximately 2%, which was primarily attributable to reduced sales of fire protection and meter products due to restrictions related to COVID-19.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>January 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>February 2, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pipes, valves & fittings products\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Storm drainage products\n</td> <td>489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fire protection products\n</td> <td>414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Meter products\n</td> <td>366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit\nGross profit for fiscal 2020 increased $89 million, or 11.3%, to $878 million compared with $789 million for fiscal 2019. The increase in net sales contributed $61 million of gross profit and the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales contributed $28 million. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2020 was 24.1% compared with 23.3% for fiscal 2019. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to acquisitions along with sourcing and pricing improvements.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses for fiscal 2020 increased $47 million, or 9.3%, to $556 million compared with $509 million during fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $49 million from acquisitions, in addition to investments in technology and strategic initiative resources and higher incentive compensation costs. These increases were partially offset by furloughs, headcount reductions and lower discretionary spending in response to COVID-19. During fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, we recognized $7 million and $6 million, respectively, of expense associated with the amortization of a portion of the prepaid compensation balance included in up-front consideration payment for the LIP acquisition. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was 15.3% for fiscal 2020 compared with 15.0% for fiscal 2019. The increase in SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales was attributable to strategic investments and higher costs from acquisitions.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nD&A expense for fiscal 2020 was $137 million compared with $125 million during fiscal 2019. The increase was attributable to amortization expense related to the R&B acquisition and a full year of amortization related to the LIP acquisition in fiscal 2020. These increases were partially offset by lower amortization associated with customer relationship intangible assets.\nOperating Income\nOperating income for fiscal 2020 was $185 million compared with $155 million during fiscal 2019. The increase in operating income was attributable to higher net sales and gross profit, primarily from acquisitions, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses and amortization from acquisitions.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $139 million for fiscal 2020 compared with $113 million during fiscal 2019. The increase was attributable to a full year of interest expense associated with the $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior 2024 Notes and the $250 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior 2025 Notes. These increases were partially offset by lower interest rates on our variable-rate debt.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for fiscal 2020 increased $3 million to $9 million compared with $6 million during fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, our effective tax rate was 19.6% and 14.6%, respectively. The effective tax rate for each period reflects only the portion of net income that was attributable to the Blocker Companies, the impact of certain permanent book-tax differences and incremental tax expense due to our legal entity structure.\nNet Income\nNet income for fiscal 2020 increased $1 million, or 4.8%, to $37 million compared with $36 million during fiscal 2019. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to higher net sales, improved gross profit and lower discretionary spending, partially offset by higher SG&A and amortization expenses, primarily attributable to acquisitions, and increased interest expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2020 increased $44 million, or 14.9%, to $342 million compared with $298 million during fiscal 2019. Growth in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to higher net sales, improved gross profit and lower discretionary spending, partially offset by higher SG&A expense from acquisitions. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP financial metric, see -Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, we have financed our liquidity requirements through cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under our credit facilities, issuances of equity and debt securities and working capital management activities. Our principal historical liquidity requirements have been for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and servicing indebtedness.\nAs of January 30, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1 million and we had no outstanding borrowings on our Senior ABL Credit Facility, which provides for borrowings of up to $850 million, subject to borrowing base availability. As of January 30, 2022, after giving effect to approximately $9 million of letters of credit issued under the Senior ABL Credit Facility, Core & Main LP would have been able to borrow approximately $841 million under the Senior ABL Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base availability. Our short term debt obligations of $15 million are related to quarterly amortization principal payments on the Senior Term Loan Facility.\nIn connection with the IPO, we used the net proceeds of approximately $656 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and transaction costs directly attributable to the IPO, from the issuance of 34,883,721 shares of Class A common stock on July 27, 2021 to purchase an equivalent number of newly issued Partnership Interests from Holdings. In turn, Holdings and Core & Main LP used the net proceeds directly or indirectly received from us, together with the net proceeds from the Senior Term Loan Facility and cash on hand, to redeem all $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior 2024 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, at a redemption price equal to 102.000% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, to redeem all $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior 2025 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, at a redemption price equal to 101.531% of the aggregate principal amount thereof by satisfying and discharging the indenture governing the Senior 2025 Notes at the closing of the IPO and redeeming the Senior 2025 Notes on August 15, 2021, and to prepay $1,258 million outstanding under the Prior Term Loan Facility, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In connection with the IPO Overallotment Option Exercise, we used the net proceeds of approximately $100 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, from the issuance of 5,232,558 additional shares of Class A common stock on August 20, 2021 to purchase an equivalent number of newly issued Partnership Interests from Holdings. In turn, Holdings and Core & Main LP used the net proceeds directly or indirectly received from us for general corporate purposes.\nWe are required to make cash payments in future periods under the Tax Receivable Agreements. Payments to the Former Limited Partners are expected to commence in fiscal year 2023 and payments to the Continuing Limited Partner involved in the Secondary Offering are expected to commence in fiscal year 2024. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements are only required to be made to the extent that we utilize the corresponding tax deductions to reduce payments to federal, state and local taxing authorities. These payments are in an amount that represents 85% of the reduction in payments to federal, state and local taxing authorities. As such, the cash savings from the incremental tax deductions are expected to exceed the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements over the life of these arrangements. Based on the anticipated filing date of income tax returns and contractual payment terms in the Tax Receivable Agreements, we expect these payments to occur two fiscal years after we utilize the corresponding tax deductions. The timing of payments associated with the Tax Receivable Agreements are summarized below:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2022\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2023\n</td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2024\n</td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2025\n</td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2026\n</td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter </td> <td>116 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Tax Receivable Agreements liability </td> <td>$ </td> <td>153 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFurther exchanges by the Continuing Limited Partners will result in additional tax deductions to us and require additional payables pursuant to Tax Receivable Agreements. The actual amount and timing of the additional payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges by the holders of Partnership Interests, the amount of gain recognized by such holders of Partnership Interests, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future and the federal tax rates then applicable. Assuming (i) that the Continuing Limited Partners exchanged all of their remaining Partnership Interests at $23.45 per share of our Class A common stock (the closing stock price on January 28, 2022), (ii) no material changes in relevant tax law, (iii) a constant corporate tax rate of 25.1%, which represents a pro forma tax rate that includes a provision for U.S. federal income taxes and assumes the highest statutory rate apportioned to each state and local jurisdiction and (iv) that we earn sufficient taxable income in each year to realize on a current basis all tax benefits that are subject to the Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement, we would recognize a deferred tax asset (subject to offset with existing deferred tax liabilities) of approximately $653 million and a Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement liability of approximately $555 million, payable to the Continuing Limited Partners over the life of the Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement. The full exchange by the Continuing Limited Partners will also decrease Core & Main's aforementioned deferred tax asset associated with its investment in Holdings by $153 million. The increase in the deferred tax asset is less than what would be implied from the incremental liability for payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements, as the cash tax savings are driven by the increase in tax basis of the individual assets within Holdings compared with the tax basis of the Partnership Interests held by Core & Main. The basis increase of the Partnership Interests, as required under generally accepted accounting principles, is limited to the fair value of the Partnership Interests being exchanged. These amounts are estimates only and are subject to change.\nIn addition to making distributions to Core & Main, Inc. to fund tax obligations and payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements, in accordance with the Partnership Agreement, Holdings also makes distributions to the Continuing Limited Partners representing the non-controlling interests of Core & Main, Inc. to fund their income tax obligations with various taxing authorities. The amount of these payments are dependent upon various factors, including the amount of taxable income allocated to them from Holdings, changes in the ownership percentage of the non-controlling interest holders (which changes from the IPO and subsequent secondary offerings), changes in tax rates and the timing of distributions relative to the corresponding tax year. Tax distributions to non-controlling interest holders were $52 million in fiscal 2021. We expect, absent all other factors, for this amount to decrease due to timing of distributions and a smaller non-controlling interest ownership following the Reorganization Transactions, the IPO and the Secondary Offering.\nWe believe that our current sources of liquidity, which include cash generated from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under the Senior ABL Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash commitments, including obligations relating to our indebtedness and the Tax Receivable Agreements, over at least the next 12 months. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Our growth strategy contemplates future acquisitions for which we will need sufficient access to capital. To finance future acquisitions, particularly larger acquisitions, we may issue additional equity or incur additional indebtedness. Any such additional indebtedness would increase our debt leverage. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Indebtedness\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHoldings' ability to pay dividends may be limited as a practical matter by our growth plans as well as our credit agreements and other debt instruments insofar as we may seek to pay dividends out of funds made available to us by Core & Main LP, because our credit agreements directly or indirectly restrict Core & Main LP's ability to pay dividends or make loans to Holdings. The Senior Term Loan Facility may require accelerated repayment based upon cash flows generated in excess of operating and investing requirements when Core & Main LP's net total leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.25. In addition, the Senior ABL Credit Facility requires us to comply with a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of greater than or equal to 1.00 when availability is less than 10.0% of the lesser of (i) the then applicable borrowing base and (ii) the then aggregate effective commitments under the Senior ABL Credit Facility. Substantially all of Core & Main LP's assets secure the Senior Term Loan Facility and the Senior ABL Credit Facility.\nInformation about our cash flows, by category, is presented in the consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and is summarized as follows:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>January 30, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>January 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>February 2, 2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>194 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>(203) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(229) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(234) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>(146) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(380) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>144 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $31 million for fiscal 2021 compared with net cash from operating activities of $214 million for fiscal 2020. The change was primarily driven by a higher investment in working capital based on strong net sales growth, driven by inflation and volume growth, and strategic inventory purchases for fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2020, we had a lower investment in working capital due to the impacts of COVID-19. These factors were partially offset by higher gross profit driven in part by price inflation and volume growth. We expect cash interest payments for fiscal 2022 to be substantially lower than fiscal 2021 as the Senior 2024 Notes and Senior 2025 Notes are no longer outstanding.\nNet cash from operating activities for fiscal 2020 increased $20 million to $214 million compared with $194 million for fiscal 2019. The increase was attributable to higher gross profit, driven in part by the impact of acquisitions, and the deferral of $10 million in payroll taxes in fiscal 2020 in accordance with the CARES Act. Additionally, operating cash flows increased $15 million from fiscal 2019 due to certain up-front payments representing prepaid compensation associated with the LIP acquisition being accounted for as an operating activity. These increases were partially offset by net increase in cash interest payments of $24 million, higher SG&A expenses, driven in part by the impact of acquisitions, and a higher investment in working capital during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $26 million to $203 million for fiscal 2021 compared with $229 million for fiscal 2020. The decrease was attributable to a $38 million decrease in acquisitions partially offset by an $8 million increase in capital expenditures and a $5 million payment in fiscal 2021 for the settlement of an interest rate swap. Fiscal 2021 acquisitions included $104 million related to the Pacific Pipe Acquisition, $62 million related to the L&M Acquisition and $12 million related to Other 2021 Acquisitions. Fiscal 2020 included cash outflows of $206 million related to the R&B Acquisition and $11 million related to the WWSC Acquisition.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $5 million to $229 million in fiscal 2020 compared with $234 million in fiscal 2019, primarily attributable to a decrease in acquisition outflows and reduction in capital expenditures. Fiscal 2020 included outflows of $206 million and $11 million for the R&B and WWSC acquisitions, respectively, while fiscal 2019 included outflows of $200 million, $18 million and $2 million for the LIP, Maskell and other acquisitions, respectively.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $146 million for fiscal 2021 compared with net cash from financing activities of $215 million for fiscal 2020. The change of $361 million was primarily attributable to a $1,079 million increase in outflows for debt repayments, net of debt issuances, discounts, issuance costs, and modification costs, and a $37 million increase in distributions to non-controlling interest holders. The outflows were partially offset by net proceeds from the IPO and the IPO Overallotment Option Exercise of approximately $756 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses paid.\nNet cash from financing activities increased $31 million to $215 million during fiscal 2020 compared with $184 million during fiscal 2019, primarily attributable to a $296 million decline in distributions to partners, partially offset by a $266 million decrease in proceeds from debt issuances, net of discounts and issuance costs, and repayments. The decline in distributions was primarily attributable to a $290 million special distribution to equity holders of Holdings made during fiscal 2019 and a decrease of $6 million in tax-related distributions, primarily due to tax law changes under the CARES Act during fiscal 2020. The change in proceeds from the incurrence of debt reflects the issuance of $250 million aggregate principal amount of Senior 2024 Notes during fiscal 2020 compared with the additional $225 million borrowed under the Senior Term Loan Facility and the issuance of $300 million aggregate principal amount of Senior 2024 Notes during fiscal 2020.\nFinancing\nSenior Term Loan Facility\nCore & Main LP's Senior Term Loan Facility has an original aggregate principal amount of $1,500 million. The Senior Term Loan Facility requires quarterly principal payments, payable on the last business day of each fiscal quarter in an amount equal to approximately 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Senior Term Loan Facility. The Senior Term Loan Facility matures on July 27, 2028. The first quarterly principal payment was made on October 29, 2021. The remaining balance is payable upon final maturity of the Senior Term Loan Facility on July 27, 2028. The Senior Term Loan Facility bears interest at a rate equal to (i) LIBOR plus, in each case, an applicable margin of 2.50% or (ii) the base rate, which will be the highest of (x) the corporate base rate established by the administrative agent as its prime rate in effect at its principal office in New York City from time to time, (y) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum and (z) one-month LIBOR (adjusted for maximum reserves) plus 1.00% per annum, plus, in each case, an applicable margin of 1.50%. The Senior Term Loan Facility is subject to a LIBOR floor\u201d of 0.00%. The weighted average interest rate, excluding the effect of the interest rate swap, of Core & Main LP's outstanding borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility as of January 30, 2022 was 2.61%. Based on quotes from financial institutions (i.e., level 2 of the fair value hierarchy) the fair value of the Senior Term Loan Facility was $1,489 million at January 30, 2022.\nFor additional information related to the Senior Term Loan Facility, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAsset-Based Credit Facility\nCore & Main LP's Senior ABL Credit Facility has a borrowing capacity of up to $850 million, subject to borrowing base availability, with a maturity date of July 27, 2026. Borrowings under the Senior ABL Credit Facility bear interest at either a LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%, or an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%, depending on the borrowing capacity under the Senior ABL Credit Facility. Additionally, Core & Main LP pays a fee of 0.25% on unfunded commitments under the Senior ABL Credit Facility. The book value of the Senior ABL Credit Facility approximates fair value due to the variable interest rate nature of these borrowings. There were no amounts outstanding under the Senior ABL Credit Facility as of January 30, 2022.\nFor additional information related to the Senior ABL Credit Facility, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPrior Term Loan Facility\nCore & Main LP entered a senior term loan facility with a maturity date of August 1, 2024, with an original aggregate principal amount of $1,300 million. The Prior Term Loan Facility bore interest at either an adjusted LIBOR rate (subject to a minimum rate of 1.00%) plus an applicable margin of either 2.75% or 3.00%, or an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of either 1.75% or 2.00%, depending on Core & Main LP's Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio. During the periods that the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio is below 5.75, the Prior Term Loan's interest rate will be calculated using the lower applicable margins. On July 27, 2021, we repaid the $1,258 million outstanding under the Prior Term Loan Facility.\nSenior 2024 Notes\nOn September 16, 2019, Holdings issued the Senior 2024 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $300 million. The Senior 2024 Notes bore interest at 8.625% per annum. On July 27, 2021, we redeemed the Senior 2024 Notes including all $300 million aggregate principal and the $6 million redemption premium equal to 102.000% of the aggregate principal amount.\nSenior 2025 Notes\nOn August 1, 2017, Core & Main LP issued Senior 2025 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million, and on June 5, 2020, Core & Main LP issued Senior 2025 Notes with an additional aggregate principal amount of $250 million. The Senior 2025 Notes bore interest at 6.125% per annum. On July 27, 2021, we satisfied and discharged the indenture governing the Senior 2025 Notes, including all $750 million aggregate principal and the $12 million redemption premium equal to 101.531% of the aggregate principal amount, and on August 15, 2021, we redeemed the Senior 2025 Notes.\nPotential for Future Debt Repurchases\nWe may repurchase or otherwise retire our debt and take other steps to reduce our debt or otherwise improve our financial position. These actions could include open market debt repurchases, negotiated repurchases, other retirements of outstanding debt and opportunistic refinancing of debt. The amount of debt that may be repurchased or otherwise retired, if any, will depend on market conditions, trading levels of our debt, cash position, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations. Our affiliates may also purchase debt from time to time, through open market purchases or other transactions. In such cases, our debt may not be retired, in which case we would continue to pay interest in accordance with the terms of such debt, and we would continue to reflect the debt as outstanding in our consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInterest Rate Swap\nOn July 27, 2021, Core & Main LP entered into an interest rate swap in which it makes payments to a third-party based upon a fixed interest rate of 0.74% and receives payments based upon the one-month LIBOR rate, based on notional amounts associated with borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility. The measurement period of the instrument commenced on July 27, 2021 with a notional amount of $1,000 million. The notional amount decreases to $900 million on July 27, 2023, $800 million on July 27, 2024, and $700 million on July 27, 2025 through the instrument maturity on July 27, 2026. This instrument is intended to reduce our exposure to variable interest rates under the Senior Term Loan Facility. As of January 30, 2022, this instrument resulted in an effective fixed rate of 3.24%, based upon the 0.74% fixed rate plus an applicable margin of 2.50%, on $1,000 million of borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility.\nThe fair value of this cash flow interest rate swap was a $31 million asset as of January 30, 2022 which is included within other assets in the Balance Sheet. Fair value is based upon the present value of future cash flows under the terms of the contract and observable market inputs (level 2). Significant inputs used in determining fair value include forward looking one-month LIBOR rates and the discount rate applied to projected cash flows.\nPurchase Obligations\nAs of January 30, 2022, the Company had agreements in place with various suppliers to purchase goods and services, primarily inventory, in the aggregate amount of $1,511 million. These purchase obligations are generally cancelable, but the Company foresees no intent to cancel. Payment is generally expected to be made during fiscal 2022 for these obligations.\nLeases\nThe Company occupies certain facilities and operates certain equipment and vehicles under operating leases that expire at various dates through the year 2036. Future aggregate rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of January 30, 2022 were as follows: $51 million in fiscal 2022, $41 million in fiscal 2023, $30 million in fiscal 2024, $21 million in fiscal 2025, $13 million in fiscal 2026 and $16 million thereafter.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, we present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not considered measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and the items excluded therefrom are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance or liquidity. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to GAAP measures such as net income or net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc., as applicable, cash provided by or used in operating, investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in our financial statements as an indicator of our financial performance or liquidity.\nWe define EBITDA as net income, or net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc., as applicable, adjusted for non-controlling interests, depreciation and amortization, provision for income taxes and interest expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA as further adjusted for certain items management believes are not reflective of the underlying operations of our business, including (a) loss on debt modification and extinguishment, (b) equity-based compensation, (c) expenses associated with the IPO and subsequent secondary offerings and (d) expenses associated with acquisition activities. Net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess the operating results and effectiveness and efficiency of our business. Adjusted EBITDA includes amounts otherwise attributable to non-controlling interests as we manage the consolidated company and evaluate operating performance in a similar manner. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that investors consider them to be important supplemental measures of performance, and we believe that these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Non-GAAP financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics reported by other companies and may not be calculated in the same manner. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n\u2022 do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt;\n\u2022 do not reflect income tax expenses, the cash requirements to pay taxes or related distributions;\n\u2022 do not reflect cash requirements to replace in the future any assets being depreciated and amortized; and\n\u2022 exclude certain transactions or expenses as allowed by the various agreements governing our indebtedness.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not alternative measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and therefore should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. and other performance measures such as gross profit or net cash provided by or used in operating, investing or financing activities and not as alternatives to such GAAP measures. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that, in the future, we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income or net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>January 30, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>January 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>February 2, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: net income attributable to non-controlling interests </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>284 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on debt modification and extinguishment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity-based compensation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition expenses (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offering expenses (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>298 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes depreciation of certain assets which are reflected in cost of sales\u201d in our Statement of Operations.\n(2)Represents expenses associated with acquisition activities, including transaction costs, post-acquisition employee retention bonuses, severance payments, expense recognition of purchase accounting fair value adjustments (excluding amortization) and contingent consideration adjustments.\n(3)Represents costs related to the IPO and Secondary Offering reflected in SG&A expenses in our Statement of Operations.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nA summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 of our audited consolidated annual financial statements. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and changes in the business environment. However, actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management judgment. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are earned from contracts with customers. These contracts include written agreements and purchase orders as well as arrangements that are implied by customary business practices or law. The revenue contracts are primarily single performance obligations for the sale of product or performance of services for customers. Revenue is recognized when title is passed to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the products and services, which is net of sales tax, customer incentives, returns and discounts. For product sales, the transfer of title generally occurs at the point of destination for products shipped by internal fleet and at the point of shipping for products shipped by third-party carriers. Estimates for expected customer incentives, returns and discounts are based on historical experience, anticipated performance and management's judgment. Generally, our contracts do not contain significant financing as the standard sales terms are short term in nature.\nInventories\nInventories consist primarily of finished goods and are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of substantially all inventories is determined by the weighted average cost method. We evaluate our inventory value at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This evaluation includes an analysis of historical physical inventory results and a review of potential excess and obsolete inventories based on inventory aging and anticipated future demand. Periodically, perpetual inventory records are adjusted to reflect any declines in net realizable value below inventory carrying cost. To the extent historical physical inventory results are not indicative of future results and if future events impact, either favorably or unfavorably, the salability of our products or our relationship with certain key suppliers, our inventory reserves could differ significantly, resulting in either higher or lower future inventory provisions. The carrying value of inventory includes the capitalization of inbound freight costs and is net of supplier rebates and purchase discounts for products not yet sold.\nConsideration Received from Suppliers\nWe enter into agreements with many of our suppliers providing for inventory purchase rebates ( supplier rebates\u201d) upon achievement of specified volume purchasing levels and purchase discounts. We accrue the receipt of supplier rebates and purchase discounts as part of our cost of sales for products sold based on progress towards earning the supplier rebates, taking into consideration cumulative purchases of inventory to the measurement date and projected purchases through the end of the year. An estimate of supplier rebates and purchase discounts is included in the carrying value of inventory at each period end for supplier rebates to be received on products not yet sold. While we believe we will continue to receive consideration from suppliers in fiscal 2022 and thereafter, there can be no assurance that suppliers will continue to provide comparable amounts of supplier rebates in the future.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangibles, are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Management periodically assesses for triggering events and discusses any significant changes in the utilization of long-lived assets, which may result from, but are not limited to, an adverse change in the asset's physical condition or a significant adverse change in the business climate. To analyze recoverability, we project undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the asset. If these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset less any costs of disposition. Our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market and operational performance. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets are impaired. Evaluating the impairment also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows that require judgment by management. If different estimates were used, the amount and timing of asset impairments could be affected.\nGoodwill\nIn performing goodwill assessments, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated. During the fiscal 2021 annual assessment, we tested goodwill for impairment by performing a quantitative assessment that compared the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. We determined the fair value of our reporting unit through a combination of an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows and a market approach based on the sales and EBITDA multiples from operations and purchase transaction of comparable companies. Determining fair value in the income approach required utilization of the significant assumption of gross margin. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis were based on our long-range forecasts and an estimated terminal value. The discount rate used in the discounted cash flow analysis was intended to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. For the market approach, we evaluated comparable company public trading values and recent transactions, using EBITDA multiples and sales multiples that were used to value the reporting unit.\nWe test goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. When the book value exceeds the fair value of the goodwill, we record an impairment charge equal to this difference.\nAcquisitions\nWe enter into acquisitions to strategically expand in underpenetrated products and markets. When we acquire a business or assets that are determined to meet the definition of a business, we allocate the purchase consideration paid to acquire the business to the assets and liabilities acquired based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. If during the measurement period (a period not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date) we receive additional information that existed as of the acquisition date but at the time of the original allocation described above was unknown to us, we make the appropriate adjustments to the purchase price allocation in the reporting period that the amounts are determined.\nFor each acquisition, we value intangible assets acquired which may include customer relationships, non-compete agreements and/or trademarks. Customer relationship intangible assets represent the value associated with those customer relationships in place at the date of the acquisition. We value customer relationships using an excess earnings method using various inputs such as customer attrition rate, revenue growth rate, gross margin percentage and discount rate. Cash flows associated with the existing relationships are expected to diminish over time due to customer turnover. We reflect this expected diminishing cash flow through the utilization of an annual customer attrition rate assumption and in its method of amortization. Non-compete intangible assets represent the value associated with non-compete agreements for former executives in place at the date of the acquisition. Trademark intangible assets represent the value associated with the brand names in place at the date of the acquisition.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a result of the Reorganization Transactions, Core & Main became the general partner of Holdings, which is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax purposes. As a partnership, Holdings is generally not subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local income taxes. Any taxable income or loss from Holdings is passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its partners, including Core & Main, following the Reorganization Transactions. Core & Main is subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes, with respect to Core & Main's allocable share of any taxable income or loss of Holdings following the Reorganization Transactions.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If it is determined that the Company is not able to realize deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance would be established, which would impact the provision for income taxes.\nUncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) it is determined if a tax position is more-likely-than-not of being sustained on the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes in the audited Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nTax Receivable Agreements\nUnder the Tax Receivable Agreements, we expect to generate tax attributes that will reduce amounts that we would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities.\nThe Former Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement provides for the payment by us to certain Former Limited Partners, or their permitted transferees, of 85% of the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) certain tax attributes of the Partnership Interests we hold in respect of such Former Limited Partners' interest in us, including such attributes which resulted from such Former Limited Partners' prior acquisition of ownership interests in Holdings and our allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in connection with the IPO attributable to the Former Limited Partners and (ii) certain other tax benefits.\nThe Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement provides for the payment by us to the Continuing Limited Partners, or their permitted transferees, of 85% of the benefits, if any, that we realize, or in some circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) increases in tax basis or other similar tax benefits as a result of exchanges of Partnership Interests for cash or shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, dated as of July 22, 2021 (the Exchange Agreement\u201d), by and among Core & Main, Holdings, CD&R Waterworks Holdings, LLC and Management Feeder, (ii) our allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in connection with the IPO attributable to the Continuing Limited Partners and in connection with exchanges of Partnership Interests for cash or shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement and (iii) our utilization of certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement. We expect to obtain an increase in our share of the tax basis in the net assets of Holdings as Partnership Interests are exchanged by Continuing Limited Partners. We intend to treat any exchanges of Partnership Interests as direct purchases of Partnership Interests for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These increases in tax basis are expected to reduce amounts owed to various tax authorities in the future.\nExcept to the extent that any benefits are deemed realized, we will receive the full benefit in tax savings from relevant taxing authorities and provide payment of 85% of the amount of any of our actual or deemed tax benefits to the Former Limited Partners or Continuing Limited Partners, as applicable, or their permitted transferees. We expect to benefit from the remaining 15% of any cash tax savings, except to the extent of any deemed realizations. For the Tax Receivable Agreements, we assess the tax attributes to determine if it is more likely than not that the benefit of any deferred tax assets will be realized. Following that assessment, we recognize a liability under the applicable Tax Receivable Agreements, reflecting approximately 85% of the expected future realization of such tax benefits. Amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreements are contingent upon, among other things, (i) generation of sufficient future taxable income during the term of the applicable Tax Receivable Agreements and (ii) future changes in tax laws. The establishment of the $92 million liability under the Former Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreements and the $61 million liability under the Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreements as of January 30, 2022 did not impact earnings as the payments were recorded against equity since Core & Main entered into the Tax Receivable Agreements as part of common control transactions.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of January 30, 2022.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a number of important factors, particularly those described under the caption Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a leading specialized distributor of water, wastewater, storm drainage and fire protection products and related services to municipalities, private water companies and professional contractors across municipal, non-residential and residential end markets nationwide. Our specialty products and services are used in the maintenance, repair, replacement, and construction of water and fire protection infrastructure. We reach customers through a nationwide network of approximately 300 branches across 48 states. Our products include pipes, valves, fittings, storm drainage products, fire protection products, meter products and other products for use in the construction, maintenance and repair of water and waste-water systems as well as fire protection systems. We complemented our core products through additional offerings, including smart meter systems, fusible high-density polyethylene ( fusible HDPE\u201d) piping solutions and specifically engineered treatment plant products, services and geosynthetics used in erosion control. Our services and capabilities allow for integration with customers and form part of their sourcing and procurement function.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Company is a holding company and its sole material asset is its direct and indirect ownership interest in Holdings. Holdings has no operations and no material assets of its own other than its indirect ownership interest in Core & Main LP, a Florida limited partnership, the legal entity that conducts the operations of Core & Main. Because Core & Main is the general partner of Holdings, it operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Holdings and, through Holdings and its subsidiaries, conducts our business. Accordingly, the consolidated financial information of Core & Main presented herein, including the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, includes the consolidated financial information of Holdings and its subsidiaries. The ownership interest of the Continuing Limited Partners related to Partnership Interests held by the Continuing Limited Partners is reflected as non-controlling interests in Core & Main's consolidated financial statements.\nAs the Reorganization Transactions (as defined below under -Significant Events During Fiscal 2021\u201d) are accounted for as transactions between entities under common control, the financial statements for the periods prior to our IPO and Reorganization Transactions have been adjusted to combine previously separate entities for presentation purposes. These entities include Core & Main, Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries and the Blocker Companies (as defined below under -Significant Events During Fiscal 2021\u201d). Prior to the Reorganization Transactions, Core & Main had no operations.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31st. Quarters within the fiscal year include 13-week periods, unless a fiscal year includes a 53rd week, in which case the fourth quarter of the fiscal year will be a 14-week period. The fiscal years ended January 30, 2022, January 31, 2021 and February 2, 2020 included 52 weeks. The next fiscal year ending January 29, 2023 ( fiscal 2022\u201d) will also include 52 weeks.\nSignificant Events During Fiscal 2021\nInitial Public Offering\nCore & Main is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on April 9, 2021 for the purpose of facilitating our IPO and other related transactions, as described below, in order to carry on the business of Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries. On July 27, 2021, we completed our initial public offering of 34,883,721 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $20.00 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $664 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. All of the net proceeds from the IPO, less $8 million of transaction costs directly attributable to the IPO, were utilized to purchase 34,883,721 newly issued Partnership Interests of Holdings for approximately $656 million in the aggregate. In turn, Holdings and Core & Main LP utilized the net proceeds from the IPO directly or indirectly received from Core & Main in the Refinancing Transactions (as defined and described under -Refinancing Transactions.\u201d)\nOn August 20, 2021, we issued 5,232,558 shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock in connection with the IPO at the initial public offering price of $20.00 per share before underwriting discounts and commissions (the IPO Overallotment Option Exercise\u201d). We received net proceeds of approximately $100 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. All of the net proceeds were utilized to purchase 5,232,558 newly issued Partnership Interests of Holdings at a price per unit equal to the public offering price per share less underwriting discounts and commissions. In turn, Holdings and Core & Main LP utilized the net proceeds received directly or indirectly from Core & Main for general corporate purposes.\nSecondary Offering\nOn January 10, 2022, a secondary public offering of 20,000,000 shares of Class A common stock by certain selling stockholders affiliated with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (the Selling Stockholders\u201d) was completed at a price to the public of $26.00 per share (the Secondary Offering\u201d). As part of the Secondary Offering, 7,455,242 Partnership Interests were exchanged, together with the retirement of a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock, for an equal number of shares of Class A common stock, which were a portion of the shares sold by the Selling Stockholders. These shares were sold along with an existing 12,544,758 shares of Class A common stock held by the Selling Stockholders. The Company did not sell any shares of Class A common stock in the Secondary Offering and did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale. The Company paid the costs associated with the sale of shares by the Selling Stockholders, other than the underwriting discounts and commissions.\nReorganization Transactions\nIn connection with the IPO, we completed the following transactions (collectively the Reorganization Transactions\u201d):\n\u2022the formation of Core & Main as a Delaware corporation to function as the direct and indirect parent of Holdings and a publicly traded entity;\n\u2022the amendment and restatement of the limited partnership agreement of Holdings to, among other things first, modify the capital structure of Holdings and second, admit Core & Main as the general partner and a limited partner of Holdings;\n\u2022Core & Main's acquisition of the Partnership Interests held by certain Former Limited Partners (as defined below) and the issuance of Class A common stock to the Former Limited Partners, pursuant to the mergers of CD&R WW Advisor, LLC and CD&R WW Holdings, LLC (the Blocker Companies\u201d) with and into Core & Main via merger subsidiaries of Core & Main (the Blocker Mergers\u201d); and\n\u2022entry into a Master Reorganization Agreement, dated as of July 22, 2021 (the Master Reorganization Agreement\u201d) with Holdings, the Continuing Limited Partners, the Blocker Companies, CD&R Waterworks Holdings GP, CD&R Associates X Waterworks, L.P., CD&R WW Holdings, L.P., Core & Main GP, LLC, CD&R Plumb Buyer, LLC, CD&R Fund X Advisor Waterworks B, L.P., CD&R Fund X Waterworks B1, L.P., CD&R Fund X-A Waterworks B, L.P., CD&R WW, LLC, Brooks Merger Sub 1, Inc. and Brooks Merger Sub 2, Inc. Pursuant to the Master Reorganization Agreement, the Former Limited Partners received Partnership Interests in exchange for their existing indirect ownership interests in Holdings and exchanged these Partnership Interests for shares of Class A common stock of Core & Main prior to the consummation of the IPO.\nThe Former Limited Partners are defined as CD&R Fund X Advisor Waterworks B, L.P., CD&R Fund X Waterworks B1, L.P., CD&R Fund X-A Waterworks B, L.P. and the other Original Limited Partners (as defined below) that transferred all or a portion of their Partnership Interests (including those held indirectly through the Blocker Companies) for shares of Class A common stock in connection with the Reorganization Transactions and the IPO, and represent entities that transferred all of their Partnership Interests (including Partnership Interests held indirectly through certain blocker\u201d corporations) for shares of Class A common stock in connection with the consummation of the Reorganization Transactions.\nThe Continuing Limited Partners are defined as CD&R Waterworks Holdings, LLC ( CD&R Waterworks Holdings\u201d) and Core & Main Management Feeder, LLC ( Management Feeder\u201d), and represent the Original Limited Partners that continued to own Partnership Interests after the Reorganization Transactions and that are entitled to exchange their Partnership Interests, together with the retirement of a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock, for shares of Class A common stock.\nThe Original Limited Partners are defined as CD&R Waterworks Holdings, the Former Limited Partners and Management Feeder and represent the direct and indirect owners of Holdings prior to the Reorganization Transactions and the IPO.\nImmediately following and as a result of the IPO, Reorganization Transactions and Secondary Offering:\n\u2022the shareholders of Core & Main, excluding the Continuing Limited Partners and the Former Limited Partners, collectively held 60,116,279 shares of Class A common stock consisting of 34,883,721 shares issued in the IPO, 5,232,558 shares issued pursuant to the IPO Overallotment Option Exercise on August 20, 2021 and 20,000,000 shares sold in the Secondary Offering on January 10, 2022;\n\u2022the Former Limited Partners collectively held 107,397,971 shares of Class A common stock;\n\u2022Core & Main, directly or indirectly through our wholly-owned subsidiary, held 167,522,403 Partnership Interests consisting of 154,834,603 Partnership Interests issued pursuant to the Reorganization Transactions and IPO, 5,232,558 Partnership Interests issued pursuant to the IPO Overallotment Option Exercise on August 20, 2021 and 7,455,242 Partnership Interests received in connection with the exchange of Partnership Interests, together with the retirement of a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock, for an equal number of shares of Class A common stock in the Secondary Offering; and\n\u2022the Continuing Limited Partners collectively held 8,153 shares of Class A common stock, 78,398,141 Partnership Interests and 78,398,141 shares of Class B common stock.\nRefinancing Transactions\nOn July 27, 2021, Core & Main LP: (i) amended the terms of the credit agreement governing the senior term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1,300 million maturing on August 1, 2024 issued by Core & Main LP (the Prior Term Loan Facility\u201d) in order to, among other things, enter into a new $1,500 million seven-year senior term loan (the Senior Term Loan Facility\u201d) and (ii) amended the terms of the credit agreement governing the senior asset-based revolving credit facility in order to, among other things, increase the aggregate amount of commitments by $150 million to $850 million overall and extend the maturity date from July 2024 to July 2026 (as amended, the Senior ABL Credit Facility\u201d). Core & Main LP and Holdings utilized the net proceeds from the IPO, together with the net proceeds from borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility and cash on hand, to redeem (i) all $300 million aggregate principal amount of the senior unsecured notes due September 15, 2024 issued by Holdings (the Senior 2024 Notes\u201d) then outstanding at a redemption price equal to 102.000% of the aggregate principal amount thereof and (ii) all $750 million aggregate principal amount of the senior unsecured notes due August 15, 2025 issued by Core & Main LP (the Senior 2025 Notes\u201d) then outstanding at a redemption price equal to 101.531% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, by satisfying and discharging the indenture governing the Senior 2025 Notes at the closing of the IPO and redeeming the Senior 2025 Notes on August 15, 2021. Additionally, Core & Main LP repaid $1,258 million outstanding under the Prior Term Loan Facility, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and settled the interest rate swap associated with the Prior Term Loan Facility (collectively, the Refinancing Transactions\u201d).\nPublic Company Costs\nIn connection with the IPO, we incurred one-time costs of approximately $11 million. We recorded $8 million as a reduction to additional paid in capital during fiscal 2021. Additionally, we recorded $3 million within selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2021.\nFollowing the IPO, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not previously incur, including costs associated with public company director and officer liability insurance, SEC reporting and corporate governance requirements, which expenses we estimate to be approximately $10 million annually on an ongoing basis. These requirements include compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Our financial statements for the periods following the IPO reflect the impact of these expenses\nPost-Offering Taxation and Expenses\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income of Holdings and will be taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates.\nIn connection with the Reorganization Transactions and the IPO, we entered into the Former Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement and the Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement. Prior and future exchanges of Partnership Interests in Holdings are expected to be treated as direct purchases of Partnership Interests for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which will result in increased deferred tax basis. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amounts that we would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities. We will receive the full benefit in tax savings and under the Tax Receivable Agreements will provide payment of 85% of the amount of any tax benefits we actually realize to the Former Limited Partners or the Continuing Limited Partners, as applicable, or their permitted transferees. We expect to benefit from the remaining 15% of any cash savings that we realize. Amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreements are contingent upon, among other things, (i) generation of sufficient future taxable income during the term of the Tax Receivable Agreements and (ii) future changes in tax laws. We intend to cause Holdings to make distributions to us in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay our tax obligations and to fund any payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreements.\nHistorically, Holdings has also made distributions to its non-controlling interests partners to fund their obligations to various taxing authorities. Following the Reorganization Transactions, Holdings expects to continue making distributions based on Partnership Interests, including distributions to us.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Business\nEnd-Markets and General Economic Conditions\nHistorically, demand for our products has been closely tied to municipal infrastructure spending, residential construction and non-residential construction in the U.S. We estimate that, based on fiscal 2021 net sales, our exposure by end market was approximately 39% municipal, 39% non-residential and 22% residential. Infrastructure spending and the non-residential and residential construction markets are subject to cyclical market pressures. Municipal demand has been relatively steady over the long term due to the consistent and immediate need to replace broken infrastructure, however activity levels are subject to the availability of funding for municipal projects. Non-residential and residential construction activities are primarily driven by availability of credit, interest rates, general economic conditions, consumer confidence and other factors that are beyond our control. The length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by market. Cyclicality can also have an impact on the products we procure for our customers or our related services, as further discussed under -Price Fluctuations\u201d below.\nIn November 2021, President Biden signed into law the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\u201d), which includes $55 billion to invest in water infrastructure across the United States. In the coming years, including as a result of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, we expect increased federal infrastructure investment to have a core focus on the upgrade, repair and replacement of municipal waterworks systems and to address demographic shifts and serve the growing population. We believe these dynamics create the backdrop for a favorable funding environment and accelerated investment in projects that will benefit our business.\nSeasonality\nOur operating results within a fiscal year are typically impacted by seasonality. Although weather patterns affect our operating results throughout the year, adverse winter weather historically has reduced construction, maintenance and repair activity. As a result, net sales are typically lower in our first and fourth fiscal quarters, especially in northern geographic regions. Abnormal levels of precipitation may negatively impact our operating results as it may result in the delay of construction projects. Our operating results may also be adversely affected by hurricanes, which typically occur during our third fiscal quarter. Our cash flows from operating activities are typically lower during the first and second fiscal quarters due to investment in working capital and annual incentive compensation payments and are typically higher during the third and fourth fiscal quarters due to cash inflows associated with receivable collections and reduced inventory purchases.\nPrice Fluctuations\nOur financial performance is impacted by price fluctuations in commodity-based products and our ability to reflect these changes, in a timely manner, in our customer pricing. Such commodity-based products include PVC, ductile iron, fusible HDPE and steel and copper pipe and tubing products, which accounted for approximately 32%, 24%, and 26% of our net sales in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019, respectively.\nWe are also exposed to fluctuations in costs for petroleum as we distribute a substantial portion of our products by truck. Petroleum prices have recently experienced significant increases as a result of the conflict in Ukraine. In addition, we are exposed to fluctuations in prices for imported products due to logistical challenges and changes in labor, fuel, container and other importation-related costs. We may also face price fluctuations on other products due to constrained labor availability and manufacturing capacity. Our ability to reflect these changes, in a timely manner, in our customer pricing may impact our financial performance.\nIf we are able to pass through price increases to our customers, our net sales will increase; conversely, during periods of deflation, our customer pricing may decrease to remain competitive, resulting in decreased net sales. The cost to procure the products we sell are historically volatile and subject to fluctuations arising from changes in supply and demand, national and international economic conditions, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulation, weather events, trade policies and periodic delays in the delivery of our products. Certain commodity-based products have recently experienced price inflation due to a decline in supply related to impacts of adverse weather conditions and other factors. During fiscal 2021, we experienced significant price inflation in respect of certain of our commodity-based products as well as other product categories, and supply chain, which we expect to continue to experience in the near-term and have sought to mitigate through inventory management, effective sourcing and customer pricing. Over the course of fiscal 2021, we experienced increasing pressure on our supply chain due to several factors, including, but not limited to, delays from our suppliers, labor availability, global logistics and the availability of raw materials, in part due to the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy that limited product availability and further exacerbated the effects of inflation. For example, access to certain meter products that we sell is dependent on the ability of our suppliers to obtain semi-conductor chips. The global supply shortage of semi-conductor chips has impacted various industries and companies, including us, and there is no certainty as to when availability will return to historic levels. As we have experienced significant inflation over a relatively short period, there is increased risk that we may experience a higher level of deflation or substantially lower net sales growth than in recent periods to the extent there are improvements in the availability of labor, transportation and products.\nInterest Rates\nCertain of our indebtedness, including borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility and the Senior ABL Credit Facility, are subject to variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase and our net income would decrease, even though the amount borrowed under the facilities remained the same. As of January 30, 2022, we had $1,493 million of outstanding variable-rate debt. We seek to mitigate our exposure to interest rate volatility through the entry into interest rate swap instruments, such as our current interest rate swap that effectively converts $1,000 million of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt, which notional amount decreases to $900 million on July 27, 2023, $800 million on July 27, 2024, and $700 million on July 27, 2025 through the instrument maturity on July 27, 2026. Despite these efforts, unfavorable movement in interest rates may result in higher interest expense and cash payments.\nAcquisitions\nIn addition to our organic growth strategy, we opportunistically pursue strategic asset and business acquisitions to grow our business. Below is a summary of the acquisitions that closed in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 and the related transaction value (in each case, excluding working capital and other purchase price adjustments, unless otherwise noted).\n\nAs we integrate these and other acquisitions into our existing operations, we may not be able to identify the specific financial statement impacts associated with these acquisitions. There can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions will be realized on the timeline we expect, or at all.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nGovernmental authorities nationally and in affected regions have responded (and continue to respond) to COVID-19 and related variants by mandating various restrictions in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. We have continued to operate as an essential business, providing products and services to our customers that they need to invest in and maintain our nation's infrastructure. We have implemented preparedness plans to help keep our team safe while we work, including new physical distancing processes and procedures, associate quarantine procedures, expanded work from home\u201d protocols and the use of additional personal protective equipment. Despite certain temporary branch closures during fiscal 2020 and the first quarter of fiscal 2021, all of our facilities currently are operational and able to fill orders, and our teams have worked effectively to address the few temporary closures we have experienced.\nThe public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the related government measures taken in response, have adversely affected (and could continue to adversely affect) some of the markets in which we operate. We experienced reduced demand for our products in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2020, and in response we deferred non-essential capital expenditures and other discretionary spending and temporarily paused acquisition-related activities, though we have since resumed these activities. In addition, the ability of certain of our associates to travel or otherwise perform their jobs was restricted and the ability of our customers to travel, conduct their business and pay or otherwise access credit was impaired. Following these government-instituted restrictions, we experienced temporary delays in certain construction and infrastructure projects primarily during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Our business stabilized during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as the substantial majority of construction and infrastructure activities resumed and sales volume returned to near pre-pandemic levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2021, we experienced supply chain disruptions related to COVID-19 and other supply chain constraints in certain product categories, including meters, and we expect to continue facing further supply chain disruptions as a result of the ongoing and dynamic COVID-19 pandemic. Over the course of fiscal 2021, we experienced increasing pressure on our supply chain due to several factors, including, but not limited to, delays from our suppliers, labor availability, global logistics and availability of raw materials that are in part due to the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy. Depending on the ultimate scope and duration of supply chain disruptions, we may experience increases in product costs which we may not be able to pass on to our customers, loss of sales due to lack of product availability or potential customer claims from the inability to provide products in accordance with contractual terms. We continue to proactively monitor the situation and our supply chain and assess further possible implications to our business.\nCARES Act\nOn March 27, 2020, the U.S. federal government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d). The CARES Act allowed for the deferral of the employer share of social security taxes for the period from March 27, 2020 through December 31, 2020, which improved cash flows from operating activities by $10 million for fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021, the Company had an operating cash outflow related to the payment of $5 million of the deferred payroll taxes. As of January 30, 2022, we have deferred payment of $5 million in employer share of social security taxes in accordance with the CARES Act that are required to be repaid by December 31, 2022. The payment of the deferred payroll taxes of $5 million in fiscal 2022 is expected to result in additional operating cash outflows during this period.\nThe CARES Act also modified certain provisions in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d) , including provisions regarding interest deductibility. For fiscal 2020, these changes did not materially impact our results of operations but did result in improved operating and financing cash flows. The expiration of certain CARES Act provisions with respect to the Code resulted in increased partner distributions by Holdings and tax payments by Core & Main in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020.\nKey Business Metrics\nNet Sales\nWe generate net sales primarily from the sale of water, wastewater, storm drainage and fire protection products and the provision of related services to approximately 60,000 customers, as of January 30, 2022, including municipalities, private water companies and professional contractors. We recognize sales, net of sales tax, customer incentives, returns and discounts. Net sales fluctuate as a result of changes in commodity-based product costs and tariffs. We seek to reflect these changes in our customer pricing in a timely manner, which will increase net sales if we are able to pass along price increases and decrease net sales if we are required to reduce our customer prices as a result of competitive dynamics.\nWe categorize our net sales into pipes, valves & fittings, storm drainage products, fire protection products and meter products:\n\u2022Pipe, valves, hydrants, fittings include these products and other complementary products and services. Pipe includes PVC, ductile iron, fusible HDPE, steel and copper tubing.\n\u2022Storm drainage products primarily include corrugated piping systems, retention basins, manholes, grates, geosynthetics used in erosion control and other related products.\n\u2022Fire protection products primarily include fire protection pipe, sprinkler heads and devices as well as custom fabrication services.\n\u2022Meter products primarily include smart meter products, installation, software and other services.\nGross Profit\nGross profit represents the difference between the product cost from suppliers (net of earned rebates and discounts and including the cost of inbound freight) and the net sale price to our customers. Gross profit may be impacted by the time between changes in supplier costs and tariffs and changes in our customer pricing. Gross profit may not be comparable to those of other companies, as other companies may include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses are primarily comprised of selling, general and administrative costs, which include personnel expenses (salaries, wages, incentive compensation, associate benefits and payroll taxes), rent, insurance, utilities, professional fees, freight out, fuel and repair and maintenance.\nNet Income\nNet income represents our net sales less our cost of sales, operating expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other expense and our provision for income taxes for Core & Main and the consolidation of Holdings and its subsidiaries.\nNet Income Attributable to Core & Main, Inc.\nNet income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. represents net income less income attributable to non-controlling interests. Non-controlling interests represent owners of Partnership Interests of Holdings other than Core & Main.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted for certain items management believes are not reflective of the underlying operations of our business, including (a) loss on debt modification and extinguishment, (b) equity-based compensation, (c) expenses associated with the IPO and subsequent secondary offerings and (d) expenses associated with acquisition activities. Adjusted EBITDA includes amounts otherwise attributable to non-controlling interests as we manage the consolidated company and evaluate operating performance in a similar manner. We use Adjusted EBITDA to assess the operating results and effectiveness of our business. See -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for further discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to net income or net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc., the most directly comparable measure under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d), as applicable.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended January 30, 2022 Compared with Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2021\n\nNet Sales\nNet sales for fiscal 2021 increased $1,362 million, or 37.4%, to $5,004 million compared with $3,642 million for fiscal 2020. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to higher average selling prices, representing approximately half of the net sales increase, strong market volume growth and share gains resulting from sales initiatives and preferred access to products during a period of material shortages, which helped drive growth across all product lines. Net sales growth for pipes, valves & fittings and storm drainage products benefited from end-market growth, acquisitions and higher average selling prices. Net sales growth for fire protection products also benefited from end-market growth and higher average selling prices. Net sales of meter products grew at a slower pace, relative to other product lines, primarily due to shortages of semi-conductor chips that are components of certain smart meter products.\n\nGross Profit\nGross profit for fiscal 2021 increased $402 million, or 45.8%, to $1,280 million compared with $878 million for fiscal 2020. The increase in net sales contributed an additional $328 million of gross profit and the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales contributed $74 million. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2021 was 25.6% compared with 24.1% for fiscal 2020. The overall increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to strategic inventory investments ahead of announced price increases, a favorable pricing environment, the execution of our gross margin initiatives, achievement of growth based supplier incentives and accretive acquisitions.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses for fiscal 2021 increased $161 million, or 29.0%, to $717 million compared with $556 million during fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $101 million in personnel expenses, which was primarily driven by higher variable compensation costs and increased headcount, lower discretionary spending in response to COVID-19 in fiscal 2020, a volume driven increase in distribution costs and incremental costs from acquisitions. In addition, during fiscal 2021, SG&A expenses increased by $21 million related to higher equity-based compensation expense, primarily due to accounting for equity awards, and $5 million of other one-time costs in connection with the IPO and Secondary Offering. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was 14.3% for fiscal 2021 compared with 15.3% for fiscal 2020. The decrease was attributable to our ability to leverage our fixed costs, partially offset by higher equity-based compensation.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization ( D&A\u201d) expense for fiscal 2021 was $138 million compared with $137 million during fiscal 2020. The increase primarily was attributable to amortization related to the Pacific Pipe and L&M acquisitions, partially offset by lower amortization on existing customer relationship intangible assets.\nOperating Income\nOperating income for fiscal 2021 was $425 million compared with $185 million during fiscal 2020. The increase in operating income was attributable to higher net sales and gross profit, primarily from volume growth, price inflation, and acquisitions. These factors were partially offset by higher SG&A expenses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $98 million for fiscal 2021 compared with $139 million for fiscal 2020. The decrease was attributable to the redemption of the Senior 2024 Notes, the redemption of the Senior 2025 Notes and lower interest rates on the Senior Term Loan Facility as compared to the Prior Term Loan Facility due to the Refinancing Transactions completed on July 27, 2021.\nLoss on Debt Modification and Extinguishment\nFor fiscal 2021, we recognized a loss on debt modification and extinguishment of $51 million. The loss on debt modification and extinguishment included (i) a write off of $8 million in deferred financing fees associated with the redemption of the Senior 2024 Notes, (ii) a write off of $13 million in deferred financing fees associated with the redemption of the Senior 2025 Notes, (iii) a write off of $5 million in deferred financing fees associated with the settlement of the Prior Term Loan Facility, (iv) redemption premiums of $6 million and $12 million for the Senior 2024 Notes and Senior 2025 Notes, respectively, (v) the settlement of the cash flow interest rate swap of $5 million which had its changes in fair value previously attributed to accumulated other comprehensive loss, and (vi) third-party expenses for the Senior Term Loan Facility of $2 million.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for fiscal 2021 increased $42 million to $51 million compared with $9 million for fiscal 2020. For fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, our effective tax rates were 18.5% and 19.6%, respectively. The effective tax rate for each period reflects only the portion of net income that is attributable to taxable entities (which are comprised of Core & Main following the Reorganization Transactions and the Blocker Companies before the Reorganization Transactions), the impact of certain permanent book-tax differences and incremental tax expense due to our legal entity structure. The effective tax rates in fiscal 2021 were lower than fiscal 2020 due to certain fixed tax expenses and permanent differences decreasing as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes.\nNet Income\nNet income for fiscal 2021 increased $188 million to $225 million compared with $37 million for fiscal 2020. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to higher operating income and lower interest expense due to the Refinancing Transactions, partially offset by the $51 million loss on debt modification and an increase in income taxes.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests for fiscal 2021 was $59 million. This represents the allocation of the Holdings' net income for the period from July 23, 2021 through January 30, 2022, which included the $51 million loss on debt modification and extinguishment, to holders of Partnership Interests other than Core & Main.\nNet Income Attributable to Core & Main, Inc.\nNet income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. for fiscal 2021 was $166 million. The net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. includes the net income of Holdings for the period from February 1, 2021 to July 22, 2021.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Class A common stock basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2021 were $0.57 and $0.55, respectively. The Class A common stock basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share were calculated for the period from July 23, 2021 through January 30, 2022, the period following the Reorganization Transactions, which included the $51 million loss on debt modification and extinguishment.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2021 increased $262 million, or 76.6%, to $604 million compared with $342 million for fiscal 2020. Growth in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to higher net sales and improved gross profit margins. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income or net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc., the most comparable GAAP financial metric, as applicable, see -Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nFiscal Year Ended January 31, 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2020\n\nNet Sales\nNet sales for fiscal 2020 increased $253 million, or 7.5%, to $3,642 million compared with $3,389 million for fiscal 2019. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to growth from the R&B acquisition in March 2020, which primarily impacted sales of pipes, valves & fittings and storm drainage products. The LIP acquisition in July 2019 was the primary driver of growth of the fire protection products. In addition, higher average selling prices drove approximately 2% of overall net sales growth. These increases were partially offset by a volume decline of approximately 2%, which was primarily attributable to reduced sales of fire protection and meter products due to restrictions related to COVID-19.\n\nGross Profit\nGross profit for fiscal 2020 increased $89 million, or 11.3%, to $878 million compared with $789 million for fiscal 2019. The increase in net sales contributed $61 million of gross profit and the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales contributed $28 million. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2020 was 24.1% compared with 23.3% for fiscal 2019. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to acquisitions along with sourcing and pricing improvements.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses for fiscal 2020 increased $47 million, or 9.3%, to $556 million compared with $509 million during fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $49 million from acquisitions, in addition to investments in technology and strategic initiative resources and higher incentive compensation costs. These increases were partially offset by furloughs, headcount reductions and lower discretionary spending in response to COVID-19. During fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, we recognized $7 million and $6 million, respectively, of expense associated with the amortization of a portion of the prepaid compensation balance included in up-front consideration payment for the LIP acquisition. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was 15.3% for fiscal 2020 compared with 15.0% for fiscal 2019. The increase in SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales was attributable to strategic investments and higher costs from acquisitions.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nD&A expense for fiscal 2020 was $137 million compared with $125 million during fiscal 2019. The increase was attributable to amortization expense related to the R&B acquisition and a full year of amortization related to the LIP acquisition in fiscal 2020. These increases were partially offset by lower amortization associated with customer relationship intangible assets.\nOperating Income\nOperating income for fiscal 2020 was $185 million compared with $155 million during fiscal 2019. The increase in operating income was attributable to higher net sales and gross profit, primarily from acquisitions, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses and amortization from acquisitions.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $139 million for fiscal 2020 compared with $113 million during fiscal 2019. The increase was attributable to a full year of interest expense associated with the $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior 2024 Notes and the $250 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior 2025 Notes. These increases were partially offset by lower interest rates on our variable-rate debt.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for fiscal 2020 increased $3 million to $9 million compared with $6 million during fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, our effective tax rate was 19.6% and 14.6%, respectively. The effective tax rate for each period reflects only the portion of net income that was attributable to the Blocker Companies, the impact of certain permanent book-tax differences and incremental tax expense due to our legal entity structure.\nNet Income\nNet income for fiscal 2020 increased $1 million, or 4.8%, to $37 million compared with $36 million during fiscal 2019. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to higher net sales, improved gross profit and lower discretionary spending, partially offset by higher SG&A and amortization expenses, primarily attributable to acquisitions, and increased interest expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2020 increased $44 million, or 14.9%, to $342 million compared with $298 million during fiscal 2019. Growth in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to higher net sales, improved gross profit and lower discretionary spending, partially offset by higher SG&A expense from acquisitions. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP financial metric, see -Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, we have financed our liquidity requirements through cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under our credit facilities, issuances of equity and debt securities and working capital management activities. Our principal historical liquidity requirements have been for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and servicing indebtedness.\nAs of January 30, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1 million and we had no outstanding borrowings on our Senior ABL Credit Facility, which provides for borrowings of up to $850 million, subject to borrowing base availability. As of January 30, 2022, after giving effect to approximately $9 million of letters of credit issued under the Senior ABL Credit Facility, Core & Main LP would have been able to borrow approximately $841 million under the Senior ABL Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base availability. Our short term debt obligations of $15 million are related to quarterly amortization principal payments on the Senior Term Loan Facility.\nIn connection with the IPO, we used the net proceeds of approximately $656 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and transaction costs directly attributable to the IPO, from the issuance of 34,883,721 shares of Class A common stock on July 27, 2021 to purchase an equivalent number of newly issued Partnership Interests from Holdings. In turn, Holdings and Core & Main LP used the net proceeds directly or indirectly received from us, together with the net proceeds from the Senior Term Loan Facility and cash on hand, to redeem all $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior 2024 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, at a redemption price equal to 102.000% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, to redeem all $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior 2025 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, at a redemption price equal to 101.531% of the aggregate principal amount thereof by satisfying and discharging the indenture governing the Senior 2025 Notes at the closing of the IPO and redeeming the Senior 2025 Notes on August 15, 2021, and to prepay $1,258 million outstanding under the Prior Term Loan Facility, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In connection with the IPO Overallotment Option Exercise, we used the net proceeds of approximately $100 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, from the issuance of 5,232,558 additional shares of Class A common stock on August 20, 2021 to purchase an equivalent number of newly issued Partnership Interests from Holdings. In turn, Holdings and Core & Main LP used the net proceeds directly or indirectly received from us for general corporate purposes.\nWe are required to make cash payments in future periods under the Tax Receivable Agreements. Payments to the Former Limited Partners are expected to commence in fiscal year 2023 and payments to the Continuing Limited Partner involved in the Secondary Offering are expected to commence in fiscal year 2024. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements are only required to be made to the extent that we utilize the corresponding tax deductions to reduce payments to federal, state and local taxing authorities. These payments are in an amount that represents 85% of the reduction in payments to federal, state and local taxing authorities. As such, the cash savings from the incremental tax deductions are expected to exceed the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements over the life of these arrangements. Based on the anticipated filing date of income tax returns and contractual payment terms in the Tax Receivable Agreements, we expect these payments to occur two fiscal years after we utilize the corresponding tax deductions. The timing of payments associated with the Tax Receivable Agreements are summarized below:\n\nFurther exchanges by the Continuing Limited Partners will result in additional tax deductions to us and require additional payables pursuant to Tax Receivable Agreements. The actual amount and timing of the additional payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges by the holders of Partnership Interests, the amount of gain recognized by such holders of Partnership Interests, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future and the federal tax rates then applicable. Assuming (i) that the Continuing Limited Partners exchanged all of their remaining Partnership Interests at $23.45 per share of our Class A common stock (the closing stock price on January 28, 2022), (ii) no material changes in relevant tax law, (iii) a constant corporate tax rate of 25.1%, which represents a pro forma tax rate that includes a provision for U.S. federal income taxes and assumes the highest statutory rate apportioned to each state and local jurisdiction and (iv) that we earn sufficient taxable income in each year to realize on a current basis all tax benefits that are subject to the Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement, we would recognize a deferred tax asset (subject to offset with existing deferred tax liabilities) of approximately $653 million and a Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement liability of approximately $555 million, payable to the Continuing Limited Partners over the life of the Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement. The full exchange by the Continuing Limited Partners will also decrease Core & Main's aforementioned deferred tax asset associated with its investment in Holdings by $153 million. The increase in the deferred tax asset is less than what would be implied from the incremental liability for payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements, as the cash tax savings are driven by the increase in tax basis of the individual assets within Holdings compared with the tax basis of the Partnership Interests held by Core & Main. The basis increase of the Partnership Interests, as required under generally accepted accounting principles, is limited to the fair value of the Partnership Interests being exchanged. These amounts are estimates only and are subject to change.\nIn addition to making distributions to Core & Main, Inc. to fund tax obligations and payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements, in accordance with the Partnership Agreement, Holdings also makes distributions to the Continuing Limited Partners representing the non-controlling interests of Core & Main, Inc. to fund their income tax obligations with various taxing authorities. The amount of these payments are dependent upon various factors, including the amount of taxable income allocated to them from Holdings, changes in the ownership percentage of the non-controlling interest holders (which changes from the IPO and subsequent secondary offerings), changes in tax rates and the timing of distributions relative to the corresponding tax year. Tax distributions to non-controlling interest holders were $52 million in fiscal 2021. We expect, absent all other factors, for this amount to decrease due to timing of distributions and a smaller non-controlling interest ownership following the Reorganization Transactions, the IPO and the Secondary Offering.\nWe believe that our current sources of liquidity, which include cash generated from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under the Senior ABL Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash commitments, including obligations relating to our indebtedness and the Tax Receivable Agreements, over at least the next 12 months. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Our growth strategy contemplates future acquisitions for which we will need sufficient access to capital. To finance future acquisitions, particularly larger acquisitions, we may issue additional equity or incur additional indebtedness. Any such additional indebtedness would increase our debt leverage. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Indebtedness\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHoldings' ability to pay dividends may be limited as a practical matter by our growth plans as well as our credit agreements and other debt instruments insofar as we may seek to pay dividends out of funds made available to us by Core & Main LP, because our credit agreements directly or indirectly restrict Core & Main LP's ability to pay dividends or make loans to Holdings. The Senior Term Loan Facility may require accelerated repayment based upon cash flows generated in excess of operating and investing requirements when Core & Main LP's net total leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.25. In addition, the Senior ABL Credit Facility requires us to comply with a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of greater than or equal to 1.00 when availability is less than 10.0% of the lesser of (i) the then applicable borrowing base and (ii) the then aggregate effective commitments under the Senior ABL Credit Facility. Substantially all of Core & Main LP's assets secure the Senior Term Loan Facility and the Senior ABL Credit Facility.\nInformation about our cash flows, by category, is presented in the consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and is summarized as follows:\n\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $31 million for fiscal 2021 compared with net cash from operating activities of $214 million for fiscal 2020. The change was primarily driven by a higher investment in working capital based on strong net sales growth, driven by inflation and volume growth, and strategic inventory purchases for fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2020, we had a lower investment in working capital due to the impacts of COVID-19. These factors were partially offset by higher gross profit driven in part by price inflation and volume growth. We expect cash interest payments for fiscal 2022 to be substantially lower than fiscal 2021 as the Senior 2024 Notes and Senior 2025 Notes are no longer outstanding.\nNet cash from operating activities for fiscal 2020 increased $20 million to $214 million compared with $194 million for fiscal 2019. The increase was attributable to higher gross profit, driven in part by the impact of acquisitions, and the deferral of $10 million in payroll taxes in fiscal 2020 in accordance with the CARES Act. Additionally, operating cash flows increased $15 million from fiscal 2019 due to certain up-front payments representing prepaid compensation associated with the LIP acquisition being accounted for as an operating activity. These increases were partially offset by net increase in cash interest payments of $24 million, higher SG&A expenses, driven in part by the impact of acquisitions, and a higher investment in working capital during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $26 million to $203 million for fiscal 2021 compared with $229 million for fiscal 2020. The decrease was attributable to a $38 million decrease in acquisitions partially offset by an $8 million increase in capital expenditures and a $5 million payment in fiscal 2021 for the settlement of an interest rate swap. Fiscal 2021 acquisitions included $104 million related to the Pacific Pipe Acquisition, $62 million related to the L&M Acquisition and $12 million related to Other 2021 Acquisitions. Fiscal 2020 included cash outflows of $206 million related to the R&B Acquisition and $11 million related to the WWSC Acquisition.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $5 million to $229 million in fiscal 2020 compared with $234 million in fiscal 2019, primarily attributable to a decrease in acquisition outflows and reduction in capital expenditures. Fiscal 2020 included outflows of $206 million and $11 million for the R&B and WWSC acquisitions, respectively, while fiscal 2019 included outflows of $200 million, $18 million and $2 million for the LIP, Maskell and other acquisitions, respectively.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $146 million for fiscal 2021 compared with net cash from financing activities of $215 million for fiscal 2020. The change of $361 million was primarily attributable to a $1,079 million increase in outflows for debt repayments, net of debt issuances, discounts, issuance costs, and modification costs, and a $37 million increase in distributions to non-controlling interest holders. The outflows were partially offset by net proceeds from the IPO and the IPO Overallotment Option Exercise of approximately $756 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses paid.\nNet cash from financing activities increased $31 million to $215 million during fiscal 2020 compared with $184 million during fiscal 2019, primarily attributable to a $296 million decline in distributions to partners, partially offset by a $266 million decrease in proceeds from debt issuances, net of discounts and issuance costs, and repayments. The decline in distributions was primarily attributable to a $290 million special distribution to equity holders of Holdings made during fiscal 2019 and a decrease of $6 million in tax-related distributions, primarily due to tax law changes under the CARES Act during fiscal 2020. The change in proceeds from the incurrence of debt reflects the issuance of $250 million aggregate principal amount of Senior 2024 Notes during fiscal 2020 compared with the additional $225 million borrowed under the Senior Term Loan Facility and the issuance of $300 million aggregate principal amount of Senior 2024 Notes during fiscal 2020.\nFinancing\nSenior Term Loan Facility\nCore & Main LP's Senior Term Loan Facility has an original aggregate principal amount of $1,500 million. The Senior Term Loan Facility requires quarterly principal payments, payable on the last business day of each fiscal quarter in an amount equal to approximately 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Senior Term Loan Facility. The Senior Term Loan Facility matures on July 27, 2028. The first quarterly principal payment was made on October 29, 2021. The remaining balance is payable upon final maturity of the Senior Term Loan Facility on July 27, 2028. The Senior Term Loan Facility bears interest at a rate equal to (i) LIBOR plus, in each case, an applicable margin of 2.50% or (ii) the base rate, which will be the highest of (x) the corporate base rate established by the administrative agent as its prime rate in effect at its principal office in New York City from time to time, (y) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum and (z) one-month LIBOR (adjusted for maximum reserves) plus 1.00% per annum, plus, in each case, an applicable margin of 1.50%. The Senior Term Loan Facility is subject to a LIBOR floor\u201d of 0.00%. The weighted average interest rate, excluding the effect of the interest rate swap, of Core & Main LP's outstanding borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility as of January 30, 2022 was 2.61%. Based on quotes from financial institutions (i.e., level 2 of the fair value hierarchy) the fair value of the Senior Term Loan Facility was $1,489 million at January 30, 2022.\nFor additional information related to the Senior Term Loan Facility, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAsset-Based Credit Facility\nCore & Main LP's Senior ABL Credit Facility has a borrowing capacity of up to $850 million, subject to borrowing base availability, with a maturity date of July 27, 2026. Borrowings under the Senior ABL Credit Facility bear interest at either a LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%, or an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%, depending on the borrowing capacity under the Senior ABL Credit Facility. Additionally, Core & Main LP pays a fee of 0.25% on unfunded commitments under the Senior ABL Credit Facility. The book value of the Senior ABL Credit Facility approximates fair value due to the variable interest rate nature of these borrowings. There were no amounts outstanding under the Senior ABL Credit Facility as of January 30, 2022.\nFor additional information related to the Senior ABL Credit Facility, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPrior Term Loan Facility\nCore & Main LP entered a senior term loan facility with a maturity date of August 1, 2024, with an original aggregate principal amount of $1,300 million. The Prior Term Loan Facility bore interest at either an adjusted LIBOR rate (subject to a minimum rate of 1.00%) plus an applicable margin of either 2.75% or 3.00%, or an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of either 1.75% or 2.00%, depending on Core & Main LP's Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio. During the periods that the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio is below 5.75, the Prior Term Loan's interest rate will be calculated using the lower applicable margins. On July 27, 2021, we repaid the $1,258 million outstanding under the Prior Term Loan Facility.\nSenior 2024 Notes\nOn September 16, 2019, Holdings issued the Senior 2024 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $300 million. The Senior 2024 Notes bore interest at 8.625% per annum. On July 27, 2021, we redeemed the Senior 2024 Notes including all $300 million aggregate principal and the $6 million redemption premium equal to 102.000% of the aggregate principal amount.\nSenior 2025 Notes\nOn August 1, 2017, Core & Main LP issued Senior 2025 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million, and on June 5, 2020, Core & Main LP issued Senior 2025 Notes with an additional aggregate principal amount of $250 million. The Senior 2025 Notes bore interest at 6.125% per annum. On July 27, 2021, we satisfied and discharged the indenture governing the Senior 2025 Notes, including all $750 million aggregate principal and the $12 million redemption premium equal to 101.531% of the aggregate principal amount, and on August 15, 2021, we redeemed the Senior 2025 Notes.\nPotential for Future Debt Repurchases\nWe may repurchase or otherwise retire our debt and take other steps to reduce our debt or otherwise improve our financial position. These actions could include open market debt repurchases, negotiated repurchases, other retirements of outstanding debt and opportunistic refinancing of debt. The amount of debt that may be repurchased or otherwise retired, if any, will depend on market conditions, trading levels of our debt, cash position, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations. Our affiliates may also purchase debt from time to time, through open market purchases or other transactions. In such cases, our debt may not be retired, in which case we would continue to pay interest in accordance with the terms of such debt, and we would continue to reflect the debt as outstanding in our consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInterest Rate Swap\nOn July 27, 2021, Core & Main LP entered into an interest rate swap in which it makes payments to a third-party based upon a fixed interest rate of 0.74% and receives payments based upon the one-month LIBOR rate, based on notional amounts associated with borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility. The measurement period of the instrument commenced on July 27, 2021 with a notional amount of $1,000 million. The notional amount decreases to $900 million on July 27, 2023, $800 million on July 27, 2024, and $700 million on July 27, 2025 through the instrument maturity on July 27, 2026. This instrument is intended to reduce our exposure to variable interest rates under the Senior Term Loan Facility. As of January 30, 2022, this instrument resulted in an effective fixed rate of 3.24%, based upon the 0.74% fixed rate plus an applicable margin of 2.50%, on $1,000 million of borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility.\nThe fair value of this cash flow interest rate swap was a $31 million asset as of January 30, 2022 which is included within other assets in the Balance Sheet. Fair value is based upon the present value of future cash flows under the terms of the contract and observable market inputs (level 2). Significant inputs used in determining fair value include forward looking one-month LIBOR rates and the discount rate applied to projected cash flows.\nPurchase Obligations\nAs of January 30, 2022, the Company had agreements in place with various suppliers to purchase goods and services, primarily inventory, in the aggregate amount of $1,511 million. These purchase obligations are generally cancelable, but the Company foresees no intent to cancel. Payment is generally expected to be made during fiscal 2022 for these obligations.\nLeases\nThe Company occupies certain facilities and operates certain equipment and vehicles under operating leases that expire at various dates through the year 2036. Future aggregate rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of January 30, 2022 were as follows: $51 million in fiscal 2022, $41 million in fiscal 2023, $30 million in fiscal 2024, $21 million in fiscal 2025, $13 million in fiscal 2026 and $16 million thereafter.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, we present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not considered measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and the items excluded therefrom are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance or liquidity. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to GAAP measures such as net income or net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc., as applicable, cash provided by or used in operating, investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in our financial statements as an indicator of our financial performance or liquidity.\nWe define EBITDA as net income, or net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc., as applicable, adjusted for non-controlling interests, depreciation and amortization, provision for income taxes and interest expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA as further adjusted for certain items management believes are not reflective of the underlying operations of our business, including (a) loss on debt modification and extinguishment, (b) equity-based compensation, (c) expenses associated with the IPO and subsequent secondary offerings and (d) expenses associated with acquisition activities. Net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess the operating results and effectiveness and efficiency of our business. Adjusted EBITDA includes amounts otherwise attributable to non-controlling interests as we manage the consolidated company and evaluate operating performance in a similar manner. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that investors consider them to be important supplemental measures of performance, and we believe that these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Non-GAAP financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics reported by other companies and may not be calculated in the same manner. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n\u2022 do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt;\n\u2022 do not reflect income tax expenses, the cash requirements to pay taxes or related distributions;\n\u2022 do not reflect cash requirements to replace in the future any assets being depreciated and amortized; and\n\u2022 exclude certain transactions or expenses as allowed by the various agreements governing our indebtedness.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not alternative measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and therefore should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. and other performance measures such as gross profit or net cash provided by or used in operating, investing or financing activities and not as alternatives to such GAAP measures. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that, in the future, we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income or net income attributable to Core & Main, Inc. to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\n\n(1)Includes depreciation of certain assets which are reflected in cost of sales\u201d in our Statement of Operations.\n(2)Represents expenses associated with acquisition activities, including transaction costs, post-acquisition employee retention bonuses, severance payments, expense recognition of purchase accounting fair value adjustments (excluding amortization) and contingent consideration adjustments.\n(3)Represents costs related to the IPO and Secondary Offering reflected in SG&A expenses in our Statement of Operations.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nA summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 of our audited consolidated annual financial statements. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and changes in the business environment. However, actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management judgment. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are earned from contracts with customers. These contracts include written agreements and purchase orders as well as arrangements that are implied by customary business practices or law. The revenue contracts are primarily single performance obligations for the sale of product or performance of services for customers. Revenue is recognized when title is passed to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the products and services, which is net of sales tax, customer incentives, returns and discounts. For product sales, the transfer of title generally occurs at the point of destination for products shipped by internal fleet and at the point of shipping for products shipped by third-party carriers. Estimates for expected customer incentives, returns and discounts are based on historical experience, anticipated performance and management's judgment. Generally, our contracts do not contain significant financing as the standard sales terms are short term in nature.\nInventories\nInventories consist primarily of finished goods and are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of substantially all inventories is determined by the weighted average cost method. We evaluate our inventory value at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This evaluation includes an analysis of historical physical inventory results and a review of potential excess and obsolete inventories based on inventory aging and anticipated future demand. Periodically, perpetual inventory records are adjusted to reflect any declines in net realizable value below inventory carrying cost. To the extent historical physical inventory results are not indicative of future results and if future events impact, either favorably or unfavorably, the salability of our products or our relationship with certain key suppliers, our inventory reserves could differ significantly, resulting in either higher or lower future inventory provisions. The carrying value of inventory includes the capitalization of inbound freight costs and is net of supplier rebates and purchase discounts for products not yet sold.\nConsideration Received from Suppliers\nWe enter into agreements with many of our suppliers providing for inventory purchase rebates ( supplier rebates\u201d) upon achievement of specified volume purchasing levels and purchase discounts. We accrue the receipt of supplier rebates and purchase discounts as part of our cost of sales for products sold based on progress towards earning the supplier rebates, taking into consideration cumulative purchases of inventory to the measurement date and projected purchases through the end of the year. An estimate of supplier rebates and purchase discounts is included in the carrying value of inventory at each period end for supplier rebates to be received on products not yet sold. While we believe we will continue to receive consideration from suppliers in fiscal 2022 and thereafter, there can be no assurance that suppliers will continue to provide comparable amounts of supplier rebates in the future.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangibles, are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Management periodically assesses for triggering events and discusses any significant changes in the utilization of long-lived assets, which may result from, but are not limited to, an adverse change in the asset's physical condition or a significant adverse change in the business climate. To analyze recoverability, we project undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the asset. If these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset less any costs of disposition. Our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market and operational performance. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets are impaired. Evaluating the impairment also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows that require judgment by management. If different estimates were used, the amount and timing of asset impairments could be affected.\nGoodwill\nIn performing goodwill assessments, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated. During the fiscal 2021 annual assessment, we tested goodwill for impairment by performing a quantitative assessment that compared the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. We determined the fair value of our reporting unit through a combination of an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows and a market approach based on the sales and EBITDA multiples from operations and purchase transaction of comparable companies. Determining fair value in the income approach required utilization of the significant assumption of gross margin. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis were based on our long-range forecasts and an estimated terminal value. The discount rate used in the discounted cash flow analysis was intended to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. For the market approach, we evaluated comparable company public trading values and recent transactions, using EBITDA multiples and sales multiples that were used to value the reporting unit.\nWe test goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. When the book value exceeds the fair value of the goodwill, we record an impairment charge equal to this difference.\nAcquisitions\nWe enter into acquisitions to strategically expand in underpenetrated products and markets. When we acquire a business or assets that are determined to meet the definition of a business, we allocate the purchase consideration paid to acquire the business to the assets and liabilities acquired based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. If during the measurement period (a period not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date) we receive additional information that existed as of the acquisition date but at the time of the original allocation described above was unknown to us, we make the appropriate adjustments to the purchase price allocation in the reporting period that the amounts are determined.\nFor each acquisition, we value intangible assets acquired which may include customer relationships, non-compete agreements and/or trademarks. Customer relationship intangible assets represent the value associated with those customer relationships in place at the date of the acquisition. We value customer relationships using an excess earnings method using various inputs such as customer attrition rate, revenue growth rate, gross margin percentage and discount rate. Cash flows associated with the existing relationships are expected to diminish over time due to customer turnover. We reflect this expected diminishing cash flow through the utilization of an annual customer attrition rate assumption and in its method of amortization. Non-compete intangible assets represent the value associated with non-compete agreements for former executives in place at the date of the acquisition. Trademark intangible assets represent the value associated with the brand names in place at the date of the acquisition.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a result of the Reorganization Transactions, Core & Main became the general partner of Holdings, which is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax purposes. As a partnership, Holdings is generally not subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local income taxes. Any taxable income or loss from Holdings is passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its partners, including Core & Main, following the Reorganization Transactions. Core & Main is subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes, with respect to Core & Main's allocable share of any taxable income or loss of Holdings following the Reorganization Transactions.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If it is determined that the Company is not able to realize deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance would be established, which would impact the provision for income taxes.\nUncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) it is determined if a tax position is more-likely-than-not of being sustained on the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes in the audited Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nTax Receivable Agreements\nUnder the Tax Receivable Agreements, we expect to generate tax attributes that will reduce amounts that we would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities.\nThe Former Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement provides for the payment by us to certain Former Limited Partners, or their permitted transferees, of 85% of the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) certain tax attributes of the Partnership Interests we hold in respect of such Former Limited Partners' interest in us, including such attributes which resulted from such Former Limited Partners' prior acquisition of ownership interests in Holdings and our allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in connection with the IPO attributable to the Former Limited Partners and (ii) certain other tax benefits.\nThe Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement provides for the payment by us to the Continuing Limited Partners, or their permitted transferees, of 85% of the benefits, if any, that we realize, or in some circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) increases in tax basis or other similar tax benefits as a result of exchanges of Partnership Interests for cash or shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, dated as of July 22, 2021 (the Exchange Agreement\u201d), by and among Core & Main, Holdings, CD&R Waterworks Holdings, LLC and Management Feeder, (ii) our allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in connection with the IPO attributable to the Continuing Limited Partners and in connection with exchanges of Partnership Interests for cash or shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement and (iii) our utilization of certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreement. We expect to obtain an increase in our share of the tax basis in the net assets of Holdings as Partnership Interests are exchanged by Continuing Limited Partners. We intend to treat any exchanges of Partnership Interests as direct purchases of Partnership Interests for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These increases in tax basis are expected to reduce amounts owed to various tax authorities in the future.\nExcept to the extent that any benefits are deemed realized, we will receive the full benefit in tax savings from relevant taxing authorities and provide payment of 85% of the amount of any of our actual or deemed tax benefits to the Former Limited Partners or Continuing Limited Partners, as applicable, or their permitted transferees. We expect to benefit from the remaining 15% of any cash tax savings, except to the extent of any deemed realizations. For the Tax Receivable Agreements, we assess the tax attributes to determine if it is more likely than not that the benefit of any deferred tax assets will be realized. Following that assessment, we recognize a liability under the applicable Tax Receivable Agreements, reflecting approximately 85% of the expected future realization of such tax benefits. Amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreements are contingent upon, among other things, (i) generation of sufficient future taxable income during the term of the applicable Tax Receivable Agreements and (ii) future changes in tax laws. The establishment of the $92 million liability under the Former Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreements and the $61 million liability under the Continuing Limited Partners Tax Receivable Agreements as of January 30, 2022 did not impact earnings as the payments were recorded against equity since Core & Main entered into the Tax Receivable Agreements as part of common control transactions.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of January 30, 2022.", "item_7_tables": "Table 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Name </td> <td> </td> <td>Product Lines </td> <td> </td> <td>Closing Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Transaction Value\n(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> L&M Bag & Supply Co., Inc.
