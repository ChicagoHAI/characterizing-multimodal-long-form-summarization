Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur Management's Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes and pandemics; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; raw material costs and availability; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the SEC.\nBecause forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company is based upon, and should be read in conjunction with, the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPlan of Operation\nCool Technologies, Inc. and subsidiary, ( the Company\u201d or Cool Technologies\u201d or CoolTech\u201d) was incorporated in the State of Nevada in July 2002. In April 2014, CoolTech formed Ultimate Power Truck, LLC ( Ultimate Power Truck\u201d or UPT\u201d), of which the Company owns 95% and a shareholder of Cool Technologies owns 5%. Cool Technologies was formerly known as Bibb Corporation, as Z3 Enterprises, and as HPEV, Inc. On August 20, 2015, the Company changed its name to Cool Technologies, Inc.\nTable 46: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>26 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nThe Company's technologies are divided into two distinct but complementary categories: mobile power generation and heat dispersion technology.\nThe Company has developed a mobile power generation system (eMGen) that enables work trucks to generate electric power by running an in-chassis generator. The eMGen system can be retrofit onto new and existing American trucks. CoolTech intends to sell the mobile electric power system to government, commercial and fleet vehicle owners. Sales are expected to occur through the direct efforts of the Company, its sales agents and its joint venture partners. CoolTech may also license the eMGen system as well.\nThe markets targeted include consumer, agricultural, industrial, military and emergency responders, both in the U.S. and worldwide.\nCoolTech has also developed heat dispersion technologies based on proprietary composite heat structures and heat pipe architecture in various product platforms such as electric motors, pumps, turbines, bearings and vehicle components. In preparation, Cool Technologies filed for and received a trademark for Totally Enclosed Heat Pipe Cooled: TEHPC.\nWhen a generator is enhanced by CoolTech's patented thermal technologies, it should be able to output more power than any other generator of its size on the market. That's because third party testing has demonstrated that the cooling provided by the thermal technologies can help increase the efficiency of electric motors.\nFurthermore, management believes that the technologies will increase the lifespan as well as help meet regulatory emissions standards for electric motors and other heat producing equipment and components. The simplicity of the heat pipe architecture as well as the fact that it provides effective new applications for existing manufacturing processes should enhance the cost structure in several large industries including motor/generator and engine manufacturing.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have seven US patents, two Canadian patents, one Mexican patent, one allowed Brazilian patent and one pending US patent application covering integrated electrical power generation methods and systems.\nThe Company intends to commercialize its patents by integrating the thermal technologies and applications with Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) partners and by licensing them to electric motor, generator, pump and vehicle component (brake, resistor, caliper) manufacturers.\nWe believe the benefits of our mobile power generation systems are quickly realized once potential customers see it in operation. Public demonstrations of the eMGen systems began in April 2017. An inspection and performance demonstration for Mexican government officials and business leaders occurred in May 2018. Feedback from initial viewers resulted in more government officials and fruit growers coming to see the eMGen power equipment and to learn about the water purification options in March 2019. Even more officials and growers followed -- flying to St. Louis for a review in May 2019.\nCraftsmen Industries was selected to produce the first systems due to its engineering capabilities and extensive facilities. In January 2019, it began production on the initial vehicles and completed an initial production run vehicle two months later.\nWhile the Company awaits funding to begin continuous production, it has continued to expand its contacts with potential clients -- meeting with government agencies, emergency responders and city officials as well as military engineers and procurement specialists. Specifications for custom applications have been noted and preliminary designs drawn up.\nTable 47: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>27 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nWe have not generated any revenues to date. Consequently, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to generate new orders nor fulfill the existing ones nor address all the requirements of all the interested parties.\nManagement is pursuing various financing alternatives, based upon a third-party assessment of the historically demonstrated or contractually committed profit-earning capacities of our IP. We see this as the best path forward for non-dilutive funding.\nIf funding is received, it will be used to support completion of the initial phases of our business plan, which is to license our thermal technologies and applications; to license or sell a mobile electric power system; and to license our submersible motor dry pit technologies and/or to bring to market our technologies and applications through key distribution and joint venture partners. As of the filing date, it is uncertain whether COVID-19 will continue to have a significant impact on production and distribution of Company products.\nThe occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic and its subsequent variants has negatively affected our operations over the past year. A pandemic typically results in social distancing, travel bans, lockdowns and quarantines. This has limited access to our facilities, customers, management, support staff and professional advisors. These, in turn, have impacted our operations and financial condition. It may also impact demand for our products and may continue to hamper our efforts to provide our investors with timely information and comply with our filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSignificant Developments\nAmendment of Series B Preferred Stock\nOn October 31, 2016, the Company filed an amended and restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (which was originally filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada on April 19, 2016 and amended on August 12, 2016) to designate 3,636,360 shares as Series B Preferred Stock and to provide for supermajority 66 2/3% voting rights for the Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock will not bear dividends, will not be entitled to receive any distributions in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, and will have no other preferences, rights, restrictions, or qualifications, except as otherwise provided by law or the articles of incorporation of the Company. The holders of Class B Stock shall have the right, at such holder's option, at any time to convert such shares into common stock, in a conversion ratio of one share of common stock for each share of Class B Stock. If the common stock trades or is quoted at a price per share in excess of $2.25 for any twenty consecutive day trading period, (subject to appropriate adjustment for forward or reverse stock splits, recapitalizations, stock dividends and the like), the Series B Stock will automatically be convertible into the common stock in a conversion ratio of one share of common stock for each share of Series B Stock. The Series B Stock may not be sold, hypothecated, transferred, assigned or disposed without the prior written consent of the Company and the holders of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock.\nAmendment of Articles of Incorporation\nWe filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada increasing our authorized shares of common stock, from 140,000,000 shares to 350,000,000 shares, effective March 22, 2017. We filed a second amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada increasing our authorized shares of common stock, from 350,000,000 shares to 500,000,000 shares, effective October 28, 2019.\nOn February 13, 2020, stockholders holding shares that entitled them to exercise at least a majority of the voting power, voted in favor of increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock, from 500,000,000 shares to 1,000,000,000 shares. The vote marked the first step in the process to amend the articles again.\nTable 48: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>28 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nCraftsmen Industries, Inc.\nAs a consequence of the first public demonstration of the eMGen 30 kilovolt amp ( kVA\u201d) system at the North America International Auto Show in Detroit in January 2017, the Company entered into an agreement in principle, dated February 21, 2017, with Craftsmen Industries, Inc.( Craftsmen'), a company engaged in the design, engineering and production of mobile marketing vehicles, experiential marketing platforms and industrial mobile solutions.\nOn April 25, 2017, we delivered to Craftsmen Industries, a Class III Vehicle (Ford dually) up-fitted with a production-ready eMGen 30 kVA (single phase/three phase) system.\nSubsequently, Craftsmen invited the Company to demonstrate its mobile generation technology and the potential benefits for Craftsmen products at Craftsmen's 35th Anniversary Party on April 27, 2017. Over 100 current and prospective Craftsmen customers were in the audience for the demonstrations.\nCraftsmen recently signed a manufacturing contract with Translux-Fair Play. Translux' Hazelwood, Missouri facility encompasses over 45,000 square feet of manufacturing space and offers extensive laser cutting and metal bending machinery. The contract significantly enhances Craftsmen's capabilities to produce boxes and control panels for the eMGen Systems and the vehicles they're upfitted to, but also all the eMGen's optional tasks and capabilities, including welding, water purification and solar power.\nNot only will basic production be optimized and improved, but control panels and displays should be upgraded. CoolTech is expected to benefit from Translux' electronics expertise which has been refined through their years of manufacturing digital scoring panels for sporting arenas and ball parks.\nAon Risk Services Central, Inc and Lee and Hayes, PLLC\nOn January 18, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with Aon Risk Services Central, Inc. and Lee and Hayes, PLLC, through its operating unit, 601West, which provides intellectual property ( IP\u201d) analytics, to assess the value of the Company's IP. As set forth in the agreement, the assessment will be founded on historically demonstrated or contractually committed profit-earning capacities of our IP and may be used to obtain financing, including but not limited to, non-dilutive financing. Since then, significant progress has been achieved, although at a pace much slower than anticipated.\nLive eMGen 80 Demonstration in Fort Collins, Colorado\nOn May 4, 2018, nine representatives from Mexico's farming, banking, and government sectors flew to Fort Collins, Colorado for a live demonstration of CoolTech's generator-equipped truck. The demonstration showcased the capabilities and ease of operation of the system. The Company demonstrated how an operator is able to control the generator from the comfort and safety of the truck's cab using a Panasonic Toughpad. The Company also used the electricity from the truck to power a screw compressor, an industrial fan, and an industrial load bank. Additional capabilities, such as purifying water and using batteries and solar power to make operations more sustainable and environmentally friendly were discussed with the attendees.\nA representative from one of the Mexican farming producers' unions approved the generator-equipped truck. CoolTech plans to put this into production as soon as final funding is secured.\nPurchase and Delivery of Truck to Craftsman Industries\nOn July 15, 2018, the Company purchased a Ford Chassis Cab Truck. Subsequently, a metal flatbed was manufactured and installed. The truck was delivered to Craftsmen on September 15, 2018. It will be used for the installation and refinement of the eMGen 80 kVA system. A second will be used for the eMGen 125 kVA system.\nTable 49: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>29 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nOrder of Parts and Components\nDuring the week of October 7, 2018, the Company placed orders for System Controllers, 80 and 125 kVA Generators, Voltage Regulators, Panasonic Toughpads, Power Take-Offs (PTO) and Split Shaft PTOs.\nAs of September 2021, the Company has acquired enough parts and components to build 5 eMGen 80s and 2 eMGen 125s. It is currently procuring two mobile water purification systems and components for mobile electric vehicle charging systems.\nIn addition, the Company has purchased another Ford and is seeking to acquire mores and 550s for use in demonstrations of the capabilities noted above and for initial order fulfillment.\nUnveiling of Initial Production Run Vehicle\nOn March 27, 2019, the Company unveiled the initial production run of its mobile power generation (eMGen) work trucks for inspection by an audience of agricultural and community leaders from Latin America at Craftsmen Industries.\nThe itinerary for the showcase event included a tour of the St. Louis manufacturing facility and inspection of the first production run eMGen vehicle in operation as it powered a variety of equipment.\nThe purpose of the viewing was not only to show the truck's capabilities, but to get feedback from the attendees.\nMexico's population is expected to grow from 129 million to nearly 150 million by 2050. As a result, energy and water demand should increase significantly.\nIncreased water demand for both human consumption and agricultural production, along with lagging water management practices have resulted in a rapid depletion of water reserves in Mexico, particularly in Northern Mexico. The forecast of high temperatures in the summer combined with a developing La Nina weather pattern could prolong an existing drought and spread water shortages.\nAccording to the North American Drought Monitor from the University of Nebraska, as of February 2022, Northern Mexico is abnormally dry with pockets of moderate to severe drought. (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/nadm/home/NADMByArea.aspx?MX)\nLast year was particularly bad for the country. In June 2021, nearly 85% of Mexico was dangerously dry. The National Water Commission (CONAGUA) reported that 1,295 municipalities experienced drought conditions and 77 of 210 principal reservoirs were below 25% capacity, especially in the north.\nWith reservoirs drying and ground water levels declining, water is at a premium. In many locations, sewage water is reused for irrigation. Water treatment is scarce and pollution regulations are rarely enforced.\nAs long as investment in wastewater treatment lags behind population growth, large numbers of consumers eating raw produce face heightened threats to food safety from diseases such as salmonella, E Coli and roundworm. Add unchecked or minimally treated industrial pollution and unusually large numbers of cases of cancer and kidney problems have been documented in consumers living near polluted waterways.\nWhile access to electricity is high across the nation, in rural areas, power can be sporadic or even non-existent. Many communities, particularly in regions populated by indigenous people, are still not connected to the grid. They rely on diesel generators to light homes and draw water from shrinking aquifers.\nTable 50: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>30 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nInterest from Mexican authorities is high in the eMGen systems as they seek to mitigate the effects of drought and guarantee access to drinking water as well as provide a consistent source of electricity and mobile medical services for underserved populations.\nThrough the efforts of its representatives in the country, the Company has been in contact with and in some cases made presentations to the national water commission (CONAQUA) as well as cabinet secretaries, senators, representatives and deputies at the federal level; to governors, legislators, commissioners and municipal presidents at the state level and to mayors and county and local politicians in cities and towns beset by energy and water problems. Private entities such as distilleries, fruit growers, cattle rancher's associations and mining companies have also requested information.\nConversations are ongoing and interested politicians are helping to promote, coordinate and refine the Company's approach to secure funding for pilot programs, full blown projects and purchases of eMGen systems and vehicles.\nMexican Government\nOn May 13, 2019, government officials and fruit growers were at Craftsmen Industries in St. Louis for a review of a first run eMGen 80 production vehicle and water purification/desalination options.\nAmong the politicians in attendance was Congressman Efra\u00edn Rocha Vega who is Secretary of the Commission of Development and Rural, Agricultural and Food Self-sufficiency Conservation, a member of the commission of Livestock and the commission of Environment, Sustainability, Climate Change and Natural Resources. Subsequent to the event, in an official Congressional Letter of Support, dated May 20, 2019, Congressman Rocha wrote: The successful demonstration of these technologies further strengthens the Mexican Government's support of Mexican entities that desire to purchase CoolTech products, as well as affirms our position to provide financial assistance to such entities.\u201d The letter can be viewed in its entirety at: http://www.cooltechnologiesinc.com/content/pdf/MexicanLegislationandFinancialAssistanceLetter.pdf.\nIntroduction of new options\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company has introduced new options, which include an eMGen System that generates up to 200 kVA of electric power, water purification and desalination systems.\nThe Company's mobile electric generation system ( eMGen\u201d) offers optional 30 to 125 kVA water purification and desalination units capable of producing 2,800 to 14,000 gallons of potable water per day. Assuming the average person needs 2 liters per day, 10,000 gallons is enough for 26,498 people. If delivery is required, an eMGen truck can also tow a water tanker.\nThe truck-mounted units cleanse contaminated, polluted and wastewater or remove saline from saltwater. Submerge the input pipe into any water source. Chemicals, particulates, salts, heavy metals, bacteria, viruses and other impurities are removed. Six levels of water purification output a range of water qualities from clean potable water for drinking and cooking tor non-potable water for agricultural or other commercial and emergency usage.\nThe eMGen systems as well as the purification and desalinization units feature fully automated controls and monitoring. A Panasonic Toughpad tablet provides a rugged touchscreen interface for operation from the truck cab or anywhere within a 300 foot radius. When outfitted with the optional telematics package, the systems can be remotely controlled and monitored from distant locations.\nThe next generation of eMGens will include a solar-powered generator system with a built-in water purification unit that makes seawater desalination sustainable. The system pumps and purifies up to 4,500 gallons of potable water per day. It can be set up and operated anywhere a four-wheel drive vehicle can go. Once the batteries are drained, the systems shift to fuel power for 24 hour operation. The solar panels collapse and fold, so the entire system fits easily in the bed of a work truck.\nTable 51: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>31 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nRugged, reliable and versatile, the eMGen trucks are designed to operate in extreme environments.

Water must either be pumped and transported from further away or very expensive desalination plants must be built to remove the salt. The plants can take years to build. </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nConsider the Texas Freeze in February of 2021. Power failures at water treatment plants necessitated boil water orders. Burst pipes and dripping faucets dropped water reserves to dangerously low levels.\nMore than 800 public water systems serving 162 of the state's 254 counties were disrupted. Over 13 million people were left without safe drinking water. The town of Kyle almost went dry.\nCities opened water distribution sites, water was trucked in to flush toilets, homeowners melted icicles and snow for drinking water, medical workers resorted to using bottled water for chemotherapy treatments.\nKeyOptions\nOn May 30, 2019, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement ( JV\u201d) with KeyOptions Pty Ltd., a privately held technology and security provider based in Victoria, Australia.\nKeyOptions develops and markets products for governments, defense contractors and other commercial applications to counter security and cyber threats. The Company will provide a license for the JV to market and sell CoolTech's entire product platform in Australia and neighboring countries in Southeast Asia.\nNew Strategic Alliance:\nOn December 16, 2019, the Company signed a cross marketing and licensing agreement with VerdeWatts, LLC., an energy generation and storage company encompassing everything from mobile solar power generation systems to large scale biogas turbine installations. Pursuant to the agreement VerdeWatts and the Company each granted the other a royalty free non-exclusive license to certain patents which license is subject to certain future negotiation.\nLike CoolTech's mobile power generation systems ( eMGen\u201d), VerdeWatts' products are scalable and offer the ability to bring power nearly anywhere it is needed. Their proprietary Smart Solar Power Generation Units and energy storage systems combine to deliver sustainable power long after the sun has set.\nTable 54: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>32 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nThe agreement with VerdeWatts also included a cross marketing and royalty free non-exclusive licensing agreement with FirmGreen, Inc., a water treatment facilities developer that works closely with VerdeWatts to create a suite of synergistic products that address significant needs in the global marketplace. FirmGreen specializes in water purification and desalination technologies. Their mobile, solar and container applications feature 6 levels of water purification for unrivaled drinkability. Pursuant to the agreement FirmGreen and the Company each granted the other a royalty free non-exclusive license to certain patents which license is subject to certain future negotiation.\nCoolTech's eMGen platform makes the companies' product offering complete with mobile power generation. It provides the capability to power everything from irrigation for farms and water purification for rural areas to electric vehicle charging and fast charging in the urban ones.\nConsider the solar-powered generator system with a built-in water purification unit that makes seawater desalination sustainable. The system pumps and purifies up to 3,000 gallons per day and interfaces with CoolTech's eMGen system for 24-hour operation. The solar panels collapse and fold together, so the entire system fits easily in the bed of a work truck. It can be set up and operate anywhere a four-wheel drive vehicle can reach. All of these systems are patent protected and cross licensed to each of the three companies.\nFirmGreen and VerdeWatts have a global presence with projects on 3 continents. The largest encompasses the installation of 14 natural gas generators to produce over 60 megawatts (MW) of power. The generators will be integrated with 50 megawatt hours of battery storage and another 6 MW of solar to ensure a consistent flow of power. VerdeWatts intend to replace most of the legacy on-site generators with CoolTech's eMGen systems, however the Company has not received any orders and there cannot be any assurance that any orders will be placed.\nTogether the companies can create an energy or utility ecosystem that can enable less developed countries to leapfrog non-existent, inadequate or failing infrastructure to deliver reliable power and water quickly, sustainably and cost effectively to their citizens, agriculture and other businesses. The scale and impact can reach from the individual farms and villages to cities and regions.\nIn fact, by combining their respective technologies: energy generation, energy storage and load management controls into a single suite of products, the companies create what is called a microgrid\u201d. Varying combinations of energy sources such as solar, wind, biogas and eMGen systems both backup and supplement one another to provide consistent, uninterrupted primary power even during severe weather or other emergency situations.\nThe synergies between the companies extend beyond water purification and power generation. VerdeWatts' wind and gas turbines and generators which produce electric power can all be improved by CoolTech's thermal reduction technologies.\nRequest for Collaboration Sent to US Government Officials\nOn December 11, 2019, letters signed by 13 government officials and Congressmen in Mexico were mailed to their counterparts in the US, specifically Governor Gavin Newsom, Secretary Rick Perry, Secretary Wilbur Ross, Senator Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.\nThe letters were a request for collaborative support between the two countries to accelerate CoolTech's product deployment into Mexico to help solve urgent rural power and water purification problems that are hurting rural communities. Those problems include irregular and faulty power in rural areas which hinders crop irrigation and water pollution which affects crops farmed for sale to the US.\nThe letters also detail the Mexican officials' satisfaction with CoolTech's solutions and management team and that they have met with the Company on several occasions for product demonstrations as well as strategic and technical advice. They highlight the benefits of CoolTech products, how they could quickly and efficiently address the problems noted, and how they expect them to become a viable part of the country's infrastructure.\nExport Import Bank of the United States\nWith the help of VerdeWatts and FirmGreen, CoolTech has initiated a relationship with the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), a U.S. government agency whose sole mission is to support U.S. exports. The bank fulfills its mission by offering very cost-effective financing for international customers and project developers to purchase U.S.-made services and purchase or lease U.S.-made goods.\nTable 55: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>33 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nTo that end, the two companies applied to finance the Mexican projects referenced above. CoolTech also sent product information for due diligence review by the technical team at EXIM bank. Subsequently, CoolTech has received a Letter of Interest from EXIM, however, there cannot be any assurance that EXIM will provide any funding to the Company.\nIncrease in Number of Authorized Shares\nOn August 10, 2020, the Nevada Secretary of State accepted and filed the Company's Certificate of Amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation. The filing amends Article II of the Articles of Incorporation by increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock from 500,000,000 to 1,000,000,000.\nNew Sales Agent\nIn January 2021, the Company terminated its independent agent agreement with Gaia Energy of Gdansk, Poland.\nOn January 26, 2021, the Company signed an independent agent agreement with H&K Ventures, LLC of Morganhill, California. H&K will act as the Company's independent agent.\nThe principals of H&K were also part of Gaia Energy. Consequently, the agreement and the expertise provided by H&K are essentially the same. H&K will concentrate on developing markets in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The agreement describes the agent's duties as generating revenue, and investment funding, for the Company from various organizations including investment funds, end-users, channel partners, integrators, and OEMs.\u201d To that end, H&K has requested quotes from the Company for eMGen 200 to 300 kVA systems with mobile water desalination capabilities of up to 900,000 gallons per day.\nTeam members of H&K Ventures include executives with more than twenty-five years' experience with Panasonic, Ford Motor Company, Electronic Data Systems and the US Air Force in the fields of advanced technologies and an African diplomat with a thirty-year background working with and for diplomatic missions, non-governmental organizations and international disasters and aid management services.\nThe former has joined the Company's advisory board while the diplomat introduced CoolTech products at a recent African technical summit attended by representatives from 54 countries.\nOrder and Delivery of Water Units and Charger\nOver the past six months, the Company has ordered two reverse osmosis water purification units and an electric vehicles charger.\nIn May of 2021, the Company ordered a reverse osmosis system capable of treating 4,500 gallons of brackish water per day. That was followed by a 100 kW, mode 4 DC, electric vehicle charger capable of simultaneous charging and dynamic load distribution. The Company ordered a second reverse osmosis system capable of treating 4,500 gallons of brackish water per day in July of 2021.\nThe units were delivered to Craftsmen Industries for installation in the beds of the three test vehicles referenced in Note 3.\nGoing Concern\nAs a result of our financial condition, we have received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm for our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 that includes an explanatory paragraph describing the uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2021, we have not commenced full operations, raising substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to generate revenue, achieve profitable operations and repay our obligations when they come due. As of December 31, 2021, we have $72,391 in cash and we owe $1,610,750 and $2,314,500 for convertible and promissory notes, respectively. We are pursuing various financing alternatives to address the payment of outstanding debt and to support the sales, component acquisition and assembly of our mobile power generation systems as well as the completion of the secondary elements of our business plan: to license its thermal technologies and applications, including submersible dry-pit applications. There can be no assurance, however, that we will obtain adequate funding or that we will be successful in accomplishing any of our objectives. Consequently, we may not be able to continue as an operating company.\nTable 56: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>34 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, consolidated statements of operations data.

We generated our first Mobile Generation order during the quarter ended June 30, 2014 and received a partial deposit in advance of completing the sale with companies controlled by the individual who is a 5% owner of UPT and a shareholder of our Company. The order is in the production queue.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, due to increases in consulting costs, professional fees as well as general and administrative.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, payroll and related expenses decreased by $12,311 due a reduction in accrued payroll taxes.\nTable 58: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>35 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nConsulting expenses increased from $316,068 in 2020 to $467,241 in 2021. The increase is due to the sales and engineering consulting that were hired at the end of the 2020.\nProfessional fees increased from $224,453 in 2020 to $254,793 in 2021. The increase reflects an uptick in the number of filings required by the Company's legal representatives to defend the Company against the eviction complaint and an arbitration proceeding.\nThe minor increase in research and development expenses from $19,069 in 2020 to $19,853 in 2021 reflects the completion of the design of the eMGen system and the Company's focus on its commercialization.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased from $68,309 in 2020 to $87,064 in 2021 due to limited funds.\nOther Income and Expense\nInterest expense during the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 related primarily to our debt. The change in fair value of derivative liability reflects the change in fair value of the conversion features embedded in the convertible debt agreements entered into in August 2021, September 2021, and November 2021, and also includes the change in fair value of common share equivalents that were previously reclassified to derivative liability as a result of insufficient authorized but unissued shares.\nInterest expense increased during the year ended December 31 from $1,472,104 in 2020 to $1,675,726 in 2021 due to an increase in short term loans.\nNet Loss and Noncontrolling Interest\nSince we have incurred losses since inception, we have not recorded any income tax expense or benefit. Accordingly, our net loss is driven by our operating and other expenses. Noncontrolling interest represents the 5% third-party ownership in UPT, which is subtracted to calculate net loss to shareholders.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have historically met our liquidity requirements primarily through the public sale and private placement of equity securities, debt financing, and exchanging common stock warrants and options for professional and consulting services. On December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $72,391.\nWorking capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. We had negative working capital of $7,370,524 and $7,042,484 on December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The increase in negative working capital was due to increases in accrued interest payable, accrued payroll and current debt. To that end, we owe approximately $1,610,750 for convertible notes that mature in the next eleven months and we owe another $2,314,500 in notes payable. Based on its current forecast and budget, management believes that its cash resources will not be sufficient to fund its operations through the end of the second quarter. Unless the Company can generate sufficient revenue from the execution of the Company's business plan, it will need to obtain additional capital to continue to fund the Company's operations. There is no assurance that capital in any form would be available to us, and if available, on terms and conditions that are acceptable. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds, we may be forced to curtail and/or cease operations.\nSeptember Convertible Note -- On September 15, 2020, the Company signed a promissory note agreement with an accredited investor.

If it is unable to close additional equity financing, the Company may have to cease operations.\nTable 63: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>39 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the amounts of revenues and expenses. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In applying these critical accounting policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in making certain estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe define critical accounting policies as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and which may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. In applying these critical accounting policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in making certain estimates. These estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nWhen facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of revenues and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized, if any, is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) exceeds the fair value. We may use a variety of methods to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use.\nIf actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to an impairment charge in the future.\nDerivative financial instruments\nWhen we issue debt that contains a conversion feature, we first evaluate whether the conversion feature meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative: a) one or more underlying, typically the price of the Company's stock; b) one or more notional amounts or payment provisions or both, generally the number of shares upon conversion; c) no initial net investment, which typically excludes the amount borrowed; and d) net settlement provisions, which in the case of convertible debt generally means the stock received upon conversion can be readily sold for cash. There are certain scope exceptions from derivative treatment, but these typically exclude conversion features that provide for a variable number of shares.\nWhen we issue warrants to purchase our common stock, we must evaluate whether they meet the requirements to be treated as a derivative. Generally, warrants would be treated as a derivative if the provisions of the warrant agreement create uncertainty as to a) the number of shares to be issued upon exercise; or b) whether shares may be issued upon exercise.\nIf the conversion feature within convertible debt or warrants meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative, we estimate the fair value of the derivative liability using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model upon the date of issuance. If the fair value of the derivative liability is higher than the face value of the convertible debt, the excess is immediately recognized as interest expense. Otherwise, the fair value of the derivative liability is recorded as a liability with an offsetting amount recorded as a debt discount, which offsets the carrying amount of the debt. The derivative liability is revalued at the end of each reporting period and any change in fair value is recorded as a change in fair value in the consolidated statement of operations. The debt discount is amortized through interest expense over the life of the debt. Derivative instrument liabilities and the host debt agreement are classified on the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve months of the balance sheet date.\nTable 64: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>40 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nThe accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record the embedded conversion option and warrants at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. The Company reassesses the classification of its derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification. As a result of entering into warrant agreements, for which such instruments contained a variable conversion feature with no floor, the Company has adopted a sequencing policy in accordance with ASC 815-40-35-12 whereby all future instruments may be classified as a derivative liability with the exception of instruments related to share-based compensation issued to employees or directors.\nContingent liabilities\nWe accrue a loss for contingencies if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred, and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimable. When no accrual is made because one or both conditions do not exist, we disclose the contingency if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. We estimate contingent liabilities based on the best information we have available at the time. If we have a range of possible outcomes, we accrue the low end of the range.\nShare-based Payments\nAll our share-based awards are classified as equity, as they may only be settled in shares of our common stock.\nWe recognize expense for fully-vested warrants at the time they are granted. For awards with service or performance conditions, we generally recognize expense when the service is complete; however, there may be circumstances in which we determine that the performance condition is probable before the actual performance condition is achieved. In such circumstances, the amount recognized as expense is the pro rata amount, depending on the estimated progress towards completion of the performance condition. Nonemployee share-based payments are measured at fair value, based on either the fair value of the equity instrument issued or on the fair value of the services received. Typically, it is not practical to value the services received, so we determine the fair value of common stock grants based on the price of the common stock on the measurement date, and the fair value of common stock warrants using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model ( Black-Scholes\u201d). We use historical data to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected stock option life and expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the stock option. For awards that are recognized when a performance condition is probable, the fair value is estimated at each reporting date. The cost ultimately recognized is the fair value of the equity award on the date the performance condition is achieved. Accordingly, the expense recognized may change between interim reporting dates and the date the performance condition is achieved.\nWe issue two types of common stock options to employees: 1) fully-vested at the time of grant and 2) market price-based vesting. We recognize expense for fully-vested stock options on the date of grant at the estimated fair value of the options using Black-Scholes. We recognize expense for market price-based options at the estimated fair value of the options using the lattice-based option valuation model ( Lattice Model\u201d) over the estimated life of the options used in the Lattice Model. We use historical data to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected stock option life and expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the stock option. In the event, we modify the terms of a non-vested share-based payment award, we would incur additional expense for the excess of the fair value of the modified share-based payment award over the fair value of the original share-based payment award. The incremental expense would be recognized ratably over the remaining vesting period.\nIncome taxes\nWe recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the income tax and financial reporting carrying amount of our assets and liabilities. We monitor our deferred tax assets and evaluate the need for a valuation allowance based on the estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets that we believe do not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria. We also evaluate whether we have any uncertain tax positions and would record a reserve if we believe it is more-likely-than-not our position would not prevail with the applicable tax authorities. We have significant net operating loss carryforwards, for which we have established a valuation allowance. If our estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets change, we may recognize a benefit in the future. UPT is a limited liability company ( LLC\u201d), which is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes, where all tax obligations flow through to the owners of the LLC during the period in which income taxes were incurred.\nTable 65: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>41 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur Management's Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes and pandemics; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; raw material costs and availability; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the SEC.\nBecause forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company is based upon, and should be read in conjunction with, the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPlan of Operation\nCool Technologies, Inc. and subsidiary, ( the Company\u201d or Cool Technologies\u201d or CoolTech\u201d) was incorporated in the State of Nevada in July 2002. In April 2014, CoolTech formed Ultimate Power Truck, LLC ( Ultimate Power Truck\u201d or UPT\u201d), of which the Company owns 95% and a shareholder of Cool Technologies owns 5%. Cool Technologies was formerly known as Bibb Corporation, as Z3 Enterprises, and as HPEV, Inc. On August 20, 2015, the Company changed its name to Cool Technologies, Inc.\nTable 46: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>26 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nThe Company's technologies are divided into two distinct but complementary categories: mobile power generation and heat dispersion technology.\nThe Company has developed a mobile power generation system (eMGen) that enables work trucks to generate electric power by running an in-chassis generator. The eMGen system can be retrofit onto new and existing American trucks. CoolTech intends to sell the mobile electric power system to government, commercial and fleet vehicle owners. Sales are expected to occur through the direct efforts of the Company, its sales agents and its joint venture partners. CoolTech may also license the eMGen system as well.\nThe markets targeted include consumer, agricultural, industrial, military and emergency responders, both in the U.S. and worldwide.\nCoolTech has also developed heat dispersion technologies based on proprietary composite heat structures and heat pipe architecture in various product platforms such as electric motors, pumps, turbines, bearings and vehicle components. In preparation, Cool Technologies filed for and received a trademark for Totally Enclosed Heat Pipe Cooled: TEHPC.\nWhen a generator is enhanced by CoolTech's patented thermal technologies, it should be able to output more power than any other generator of its size on the market. That's because third party testing has demonstrated that the cooling provided by the thermal technologies can help increase the efficiency of electric motors.\nFurthermore, management believes that the technologies will increase the lifespan as well as help meet regulatory emissions standards for electric motors and other heat producing equipment and components. The simplicity of the heat pipe architecture as well as the fact that it provides effective new applications for existing manufacturing processes should enhance the cost structure in several large industries including motor/generator and engine manufacturing.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have seven US patents, two Canadian patents, one Mexican patent, one allowed Brazilian patent and one pending US patent application covering integrated electrical power generation methods and systems.\nThe Company intends to commercialize its patents by integrating the thermal technologies and applications with Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) partners and by licensing them to electric motor, generator, pump and vehicle component (brake, resistor, caliper) manufacturers.\nWe believe the benefits of our mobile power generation systems are quickly realized once potential customers see it in operation. Public demonstrations of the eMGen systems began in April 2017. An inspection and performance demonstration for Mexican government officials and business leaders occurred in May 2018. Feedback from initial viewers resulted in more government officials and fruit growers coming to see the eMGen power equipment and to learn about the water purification options in March 2019. Even more officials and growers followed -- flying to St. Louis for a review in May 2019.\nCraftsmen Industries was selected to produce the first systems due to its engineering capabilities and extensive facilities. In January 2019, it began production on the initial vehicles and completed an initial production run vehicle two months later.\nWhile the Company awaits funding to begin continuous production, it has continued to expand its contacts with potential clients -- meeting with government agencies, emergency responders and city officials as well as military engineers and procurement specialists. Specifications for custom applications have been noted and preliminary designs drawn up.\nTable 47: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>27 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nWe have not generated any revenues to date. Consequently, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to generate new orders nor fulfill the existing ones nor address all the requirements of all the interested parties.\nManagement is pursuing various financing alternatives, based upon a third-party assessment of the historically demonstrated or contractually committed profit-earning capacities of our IP. We see this as the best path forward for non-dilutive funding.\nIf funding is received, it will be used to support completion of the initial phases of our business plan, which is to license our thermal technologies and applications; to license or sell a mobile electric power system; and to license our submersible motor dry pit technologies and/or to bring to market our technologies and applications through key distribution and joint venture partners. As of the filing date, it is uncertain whether COVID-19 will continue to have a significant impact on production and distribution of Company products.\nThe occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic and its subsequent variants has negatively affected our operations over the past year. A pandemic typically results in social distancing, travel bans, lockdowns and quarantines. This has limited access to our facilities, customers, management, support staff and professional advisors. These, in turn, have impacted our operations and financial condition. It may also impact demand for our products and may continue to hamper our efforts to provide our investors with timely information and comply with our filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSignificant Developments\nAmendment of Series B Preferred Stock\nOn October 31, 2016, the Company filed an amended and restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (which was originally filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada on April 19, 2016 and amended on August 12, 2016) to designate 3,636,360 shares as Series B Preferred Stock and to provide for supermajority 66 2/3% voting rights for the Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock will not bear dividends, will not be entitled to receive any distributions in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, and will have no other preferences, rights, restrictions, or qualifications, except as otherwise provided by law or the articles of incorporation of the Company. The holders of Class B Stock shall have the right, at such holder's option, at any time to convert such shares into common stock, in a conversion ratio of one share of common stock for each share of Class B Stock. If the common stock trades or is quoted at a price per share in excess of $2.25 for any twenty consecutive day trading period, (subject to appropriate adjustment for forward or reverse stock splits, recapitalizations, stock dividends and the like), the Series B Stock will automatically be convertible into the common stock in a conversion ratio of one share of common stock for each share of Series B Stock. The Series B Stock may not be sold, hypothecated, transferred, assigned or disposed without the prior written consent of the Company and the holders of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock.\nAmendment of Articles of Incorporation\nWe filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada increasing our authorized shares of common stock, from 140,000,000 shares to 350,000,000 shares, effective March 22, 2017. We filed a second amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada increasing our authorized shares of common stock, from 350,000,000 shares to 500,000,000 shares, effective October 28, 2019.\nOn February 13, 2020, stockholders holding shares that entitled them to exercise at least a majority of the voting power, voted in favor of increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock, from 500,000,000 shares to 1,000,000,000 shares. The vote marked the first step in the process to amend the articles again.\nTable 48: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>28 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nCraftsmen Industries, Inc.\nAs a consequence of the first public demonstration of the eMGen 30 kilovolt amp ( kVA\u201d) system at the North America International Auto Show in Detroit in January 2017, the Company entered into an agreement in principle, dated February 21, 2017, with Craftsmen Industries, Inc.( Craftsmen'), a company engaged in the design, engineering and production of mobile marketing vehicles, experiential marketing platforms and industrial mobile solutions.\nOn April 25, 2017, we delivered to Craftsmen Industries, a Class III Vehicle (Ford dually) up-fitted with a production-ready eMGen 30 kVA (single phase/three phase) system.\nSubsequently, Craftsmen invited the Company to demonstrate its mobile generation technology and the potential benefits for Craftsmen products at Craftsmen's 35th Anniversary Party on April 27, 2017. Over 100 current and prospective Craftsmen customers were in the audience for the demonstrations.\nCraftsmen recently signed a manufacturing contract with Translux-Fair Play. Translux' Hazelwood, Missouri facility encompasses over 45,000 square feet of manufacturing space and offers extensive laser cutting and metal bending machinery. The contract significantly enhances Craftsmen's capabilities to produce boxes and control panels for the eMGen Systems and the vehicles they're upfitted to, but also all the eMGen's optional tasks and capabilities, including welding, water purification and solar power.\nNot only will basic production be optimized and improved, but control panels and displays should be upgraded. CoolTech is expected to benefit from Translux' electronics expertise which has been refined through their years of manufacturing digital scoring panels for sporting arenas and ball parks.\nAon Risk Services Central, Inc and Lee and Hayes, PLLC\nOn January 18, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with Aon Risk Services Central, Inc. and Lee and Hayes, PLLC, through its operating unit, 601West, which provides intellectual property ( IP\u201d) analytics, to assess the value of the Company's IP. As set forth in the agreement, the assessment will be founded on historically demonstrated or contractually committed profit-earning capacities of our IP and may be used to obtain financing, including but not limited to, non-dilutive financing. Since then, significant progress has been achieved, although at a pace much slower than anticipated.\nLive eMGen 80 Demonstration in Fort Collins, Colorado\nOn May 4, 2018, nine representatives from Mexico's farming, banking, and government sectors flew to Fort Collins, Colorado for a live demonstration of CoolTech's generator-equipped truck. The demonstration showcased the capabilities and ease of operation of the system. The Company demonstrated how an operator is able to control the generator from the comfort and safety of the truck's cab using a Panasonic Toughpad. The Company also used the electricity from the truck to power a screw compressor, an industrial fan, and an industrial load bank. Additional capabilities, such as purifying water and using batteries and solar power to make operations more sustainable and environmentally friendly were discussed with the attendees.\nA representative from one of the Mexican farming producers' unions approved the generator-equipped truck. CoolTech plans to put this into production as soon as final funding is secured.\nPurchase and Delivery of Truck to Craftsman Industries\nOn July 15, 2018, the Company purchased a Ford Chassis Cab Truck. Subsequently, a metal flatbed was manufactured and installed. The truck was delivered to Craftsmen on September 15, 2018. It will be used for the installation and refinement of the eMGen 80 kVA system. A second will be used for the eMGen 125 kVA system.\nTable 49: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>29 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nOrder of Parts and Components\nDuring the week of October 7, 2018, the Company placed orders for System Controllers, 80 and 125 kVA Generators, Voltage Regulators, Panasonic Toughpads, Power Take-Offs (PTO) and Split Shaft PTOs.\nAs of September 2021, the Company has acquired enough parts and components to build 5 eMGen 80s and 2 eMGen 125s. It is currently procuring two mobile water purification systems and components for mobile electric vehicle charging systems.\nIn addition, the Company has purchased another Ford and is seeking to acquire mores and 550s for use in demonstrations of the capabilities noted above and for initial order fulfillment.\nUnveiling of Initial Production Run Vehicle\nOn March 27, 2019, the Company unveiled the initial production run of its mobile power generation (eMGen) work trucks for inspection by an audience of agricultural and community leaders from Latin America at Craftsmen Industries.\nThe itinerary for the showcase event included a tour of the St. Louis manufacturing facility and inspection of the first production run eMGen vehicle in operation as it powered a variety of equipment.\nThe purpose of the viewing was not only to show the truck's capabilities, but to get feedback from the attendees.\nMexico's population is expected to grow from 129 million to nearly 150 million by 2050. As a result, energy and water demand should increase significantly.\nIncreased water demand for both human consumption and agricultural production, along with lagging water management practices have resulted in a rapid depletion of water reserves in Mexico, particularly in Northern Mexico. The forecast of high temperatures in the summer combined with a developing La Nina weather pattern could prolong an existing drought and spread water shortages.\nAccording to the North American Drought Monitor from the University of Nebraska, as of February 2022, Northern Mexico is abnormally dry with pockets of moderate to severe drought. (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/nadm/home/NADMByArea.aspx?MX)\nLast year was particularly bad for the country. In June 2021, nearly 85% of Mexico was dangerously dry. The National Water Commission (CONAGUA) reported that 1,295 municipalities experienced drought conditions and 77 of 210 principal reservoirs were below 25% capacity, especially in the north.\nWith reservoirs drying and ground water levels declining, water is at a premium. In many locations, sewage water is reused for irrigation. Water treatment is scarce and pollution regulations are rarely enforced.\nAs long as investment in wastewater treatment lags behind population growth, large numbers of consumers eating raw produce face heightened threats to food safety from diseases such as salmonella, E Coli and roundworm. Add unchecked or minimally treated industrial pollution and unusually large numbers of cases of cancer and kidney problems have been documented in consumers living near polluted waterways.\nWhile access to electricity is high across the nation, in rural areas, power can be sporadic or even non-existent. Many communities, particularly in regions populated by indigenous people, are still not connected to the grid. They rely on diesel generators to light homes and draw water from shrinking aquifers.\nTable 50: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>30 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nInterest from Mexican authorities is high in the eMGen systems as they seek to mitigate the effects of drought and guarantee access to drinking water as well as provide a consistent source of electricity and mobile medical services for underserved populations.\nThrough the efforts of its representatives in the country, the Company has been in contact with and in some cases made presentations to the national water commission (CONAQUA) as well as cabinet secretaries, senators, representatives and deputies at the federal level; to governors, legislators, commissioners and municipal presidents at the state level and to mayors and county and local politicians in cities and towns beset by energy and water problems. Private entities such as distilleries, fruit growers, cattle rancher's associations and mining companies have also requested information.\nConversations are ongoing and interested politicians are helping to promote, coordinate and refine the Company's approach to secure funding for pilot programs, full blown projects and purchases of eMGen systems and vehicles.\nMexican Government\nOn May 13, 2019, government officials and fruit growers were at Craftsmen Industries in St. Louis for a review of a first run eMGen 80 production vehicle and water purification/desalination options.\nAmong the politicians in attendance was Congressman Efra\u00edn Rocha Vega who is Secretary of the Commission of Development and Rural, Agricultural and Food Self-sufficiency Conservation, a member of the commission of Livestock and the commission of Environment, Sustainability, Climate Change and Natural Resources. Subsequent to the event, in an official Congressional Letter of Support, dated May 20, 2019, Congressman Rocha wrote: The successful demonstration of these technologies further strengthens the Mexican Government's support of Mexican entities that desire to purchase CoolTech products, as well as affirms our position to provide financial assistance to such entities.\u201d The letter can be viewed in its entirety at: http://www.cooltechnologiesinc.com/content/pdf/MexicanLegislationandFinancialAssistanceLetter.pdf.\nIntroduction of new options\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company has introduced new options, which include an eMGen System that generates up to 200 kVA of electric power, water purification and desalination systems.\nThe Company's mobile electric generation system ( eMGen\u201d) offers optional 30 to 125 kVA water purification and desalination units capable of producing 2,800 to 14,000 gallons of potable water per day. Assuming the average person needs 2 liters per day, 10,000 gallons is enough for 26,498 people. If delivery is required, an eMGen truck can also tow a water tanker.\nThe truck-mounted units cleanse contaminated, polluted and wastewater or remove saline from saltwater. Submerge the input pipe into any water source. Chemicals, particulates, salts, heavy metals, bacteria, viruses and other impurities are removed. Six levels of water purification output a range of water qualities from clean potable water for drinking and cooking tor non-potable water for agricultural or other commercial and emergency usage.\nThe eMGen systems as well as the purification and desalinization units feature fully automated controls and monitoring. A Panasonic Toughpad tablet provides a rugged touchscreen interface for operation from the truck cab or anywhere within a 300 foot radius. When outfitted with the optional telematics package, the systems can be remotely controlled and monitored from distant locations.\nThe next generation of eMGens will include a solar-powered generator system with a built-in water purification unit that makes seawater desalination sustainable. The system pumps and purifies up to 4,500 gallons of potable water per day. It can be set up and operated anywhere a four-wheel drive vehicle can go. Once the batteries are drained, the systems shift to fuel power for 24 hour operation. The solar panels collapse and fold, so the entire system fits easily in the bed of a work truck.\nTable 51: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>31 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nRugged, reliable and versatile, the eMGen trucks are designed to operate in extreme environments.

Burst pipes and dripping faucets dropped water reserves to dangerously low levels.\nMore than 800 public water systems serving 162 of the state's 254 counties were disrupted. Over 13 million people were left without safe drinking water. The town of Kyle almost went dry.\nCities opened water distribution sites, water was trucked in to flush toilets, homeowners melted icicles and snow for drinking water, medical workers resorted to using bottled water for chemotherapy treatments.\nKeyOptions\nOn May 30, 2019, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement ( JV\u201d) with KeyOptions Pty Ltd., a privately held technology and security provider based in Victoria, Australia.\nKeyOptions develops and markets products for governments, defense contractors and other commercial applications to counter security and cyber threats. The Company will provide a license for the JV to market and sell CoolTech's entire product platform in Australia and neighboring countries in Southeast Asia.\nNew Strategic Alliance:\nOn December 16, 2019, the Company signed a cross marketing and licensing agreement with VerdeWatts, LLC., an energy generation and storage company encompassing everything from mobile solar power generation systems to large scale biogas turbine installations. Pursuant to the agreement VerdeWatts and the Company each granted the other a royalty free non-exclusive license to certain patents which license is subject to certain future negotiation.\nLike CoolTech's mobile power generation systems ( eMGen\u201d), VerdeWatts' products are scalable and offer the ability to bring power nearly anywhere it is needed. Their proprietary Smart Solar Power Generation Units and energy storage systems combine to deliver sustainable power long after the sun has set.\nTable 54: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>32 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nThe agreement with VerdeWatts also included a cross marketing and royalty free non-exclusive licensing agreement with FirmGreen, Inc., a water treatment facilities developer that works closely with VerdeWatts to create a suite of synergistic products that address significant needs in the global marketplace. FirmGreen specializes in water purification and desalination technologies. Their mobile, solar and container applications feature 6 levels of water purification for unrivaled drinkability. Pursuant to the agreement FirmGreen and the Company each granted the other a royalty free non-exclusive license to certain patents which license is subject to certain future negotiation.\nCoolTech's eMGen platform makes the companies' product offering complete with mobile power generation. It provides the capability to power everything from irrigation for farms and water purification for rural areas to electric vehicle charging and fast charging in the urban ones.\nConsider the solar-powered generator system with a built-in water purification unit that makes seawater desalination sustainable. The system pumps and purifies up to 3,000 gallons per day and interfaces with CoolTech's eMGen system for 24-hour operation. The solar panels collapse and fold together, so the entire system fits easily in the bed of a work truck. It can be set up and operate anywhere a four-wheel drive vehicle can reach. All of these systems are patent protected and cross licensed to each of the three companies.\nFirmGreen and VerdeWatts have a global presence with projects on 3 continents. The largest encompasses the installation of 14 natural gas generators to produce over 60 megawatts (MW) of power. The generators will be integrated with 50 megawatt hours of battery storage and another 6 MW of solar to ensure a consistent flow of power. VerdeWatts intend to replace most of the legacy on-site generators with CoolTech's eMGen systems, however the Company has not received any orders and there cannot be any assurance that any orders will be placed.\nTogether the companies can create an energy or utility ecosystem that can enable less developed countries to leapfrog non-existent, inadequate or failing infrastructure to deliver reliable power and water quickly, sustainably and cost effectively to their citizens, agriculture and other businesses. The scale and impact can reach from the individual farms and villages to cities and regions.\nIn fact, by combining their respective technologies: energy generation, energy storage and load management controls into a single suite of products, the companies create what is called a microgrid\u201d. Varying combinations of energy sources such as solar, wind, biogas and eMGen systems both backup and supplement one another to provide consistent, uninterrupted primary power even during severe weather or other emergency situations.\nThe synergies between the companies extend beyond water purification and power generation. VerdeWatts' wind and gas turbines and generators which produce electric power can all be improved by CoolTech's thermal reduction technologies.\nRequest for Collaboration Sent to US Government Officials\nOn December 11, 2019, letters signed by 13 government officials and Congressmen in Mexico were mailed to their counterparts in the US, specifically Governor Gavin Newsom, Secretary Rick Perry, Secretary Wilbur Ross, Senator Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.\nThe letters were a request for collaborative support between the two countries to accelerate CoolTech's product deployment into Mexico to help solve urgent rural power and water purification problems that are hurting rural communities. Those problems include irregular and faulty power in rural areas which hinders crop irrigation and water pollution which affects crops farmed for sale to the US.\nThe letters also detail the Mexican officials' satisfaction with CoolTech's solutions and management team and that they have met with the Company on several occasions for product demonstrations as well as strategic and technical advice. They highlight the benefits of CoolTech products, how they could quickly and efficiently address the problems noted, and how they expect them to become a viable part of the country's infrastructure.\nExport Import Bank of the United States\nWith the help of VerdeWatts and FirmGreen, CoolTech has initiated a relationship with the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), a U.S. government agency whose sole mission is to support U.S. exports. The bank fulfills its mission by offering very cost-effective financing for international customers and project developers to purchase U.S.-made services and purchase or lease U.S.-made goods.\nTable 55: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>33 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nTo that end, the two companies applied to finance the Mexican projects referenced above. CoolTech also sent product information for due diligence review by the technical team at EXIM bank. Subsequently, CoolTech has received a Letter of Interest from EXIM, however, there cannot be any assurance that EXIM will provide any funding to the Company.\nIncrease in Number of Authorized Shares\nOn August 10, 2020, the Nevada Secretary of State accepted and filed the Company's Certificate of Amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation. The filing amends Article II of the Articles of Incorporation by increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock from 500,000,000 to 1,000,000,000.\nNew Sales Agent\nIn January 2021, the Company terminated its independent agent agreement with Gaia Energy of Gdansk, Poland.\nOn January 26, 2021, the Company signed an independent agent agreement with H&K Ventures, LLC of Morganhill, California. H&K will act as the Company's independent agent.\nThe principals of H&K were also part of Gaia Energy. Consequently, the agreement and the expertise provided by H&K are essentially the same. H&K will concentrate on developing markets in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The agreement describes the agent's duties as generating revenue, and investment funding, for the Company from various organizations including investment funds, end-users, channel partners, integrators, and OEMs.\u201d To that end, H&K has requested quotes from the Company for eMGen 200 to 300 kVA systems with mobile water desalination capabilities of up to 900,000 gallons per day.\nTeam members of H&K Ventures include executives with more than twenty-five years' experience with Panasonic, Ford Motor Company, Electronic Data Systems and the US Air Force in the fields of advanced technologies and an African diplomat with a thirty-year background working with and for diplomatic missions, non-governmental organizations and international disasters and aid management services.\nThe former has joined the Company's advisory board while the diplomat introduced CoolTech products at a recent African technical summit attended by representatives from 54 countries.\nOrder and Delivery of Water Units and Charger\nOver the past six months, the Company has ordered two reverse osmosis water purification units and an electric vehicles charger.\nIn May of 2021, the Company ordered a reverse osmosis system capable of treating 4,500 gallons of brackish water per day. That was followed by a 100 kW, mode 4 DC, electric vehicle charger capable of simultaneous charging and dynamic load distribution. The Company ordered a second reverse osmosis system capable of treating 4,500 gallons of brackish water per day in July of 2021.\nThe units were delivered to Craftsmen Industries for installation in the beds of the three test vehicles referenced in Note 3.\nGoing Concern\nAs a result of our financial condition, we have received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm for our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 that includes an explanatory paragraph describing the uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2021, we have not commenced full operations, raising substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to generate revenue, achieve profitable operations and repay our obligations when they come due. As of December 31, 2021, we have $72,391 in cash and we owe $1,610,750 and $2,314,500 for convertible and promissory notes, respectively. We are pursuing various financing alternatives to address the payment of outstanding debt and to support the sales, component acquisition and assembly of our mobile power generation systems as well as the completion of the secondary elements of our business plan: to license its thermal technologies and applications, including submersible dry-pit applications. There can be no assurance, however, that we will obtain adequate funding or that we will be successful in accomplishing any of our objectives. Consequently, we may not be able to continue as an operating company.\nTable 56: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>34 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, consolidated statements of operations data.

</td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nRevenues\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, and since inception, we have not generated any revenues. We generated our first Mobile Generation order during the quarter ended June 30, 2014 and received a partial deposit in advance of completing the sale with companies controlled by the individual who is a 5% owner of UPT and a shareholder of our Company. The order is in the production queue.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, due to increases in consulting costs, professional fees as well as general and administrative.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, payroll and related expenses decreased by $12,311 due a reduction in accrued payroll taxes.\nTable 58: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>35 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nConsulting expenses increased from $316,068 in 2020 to $467,241 in 2021. The increase is due to the sales and engineering consulting that were hired at the end of the 2020.\nProfessional fees increased from $224,453 in 2020 to $254,793 in 2021. The increase reflects an uptick in the number of filings required by the Company's legal representatives to defend the Company against the eviction complaint and an arbitration proceeding.\nThe minor increase in research and development expenses from $19,069 in 2020 to $19,853 in 2021 reflects the completion of the design of the eMGen system and the Company's focus on its commercialization.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased from $68,309 in 2020 to $87,064 in 2021 due to limited funds.\nOther Income and Expense\nInterest expense during the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 related primarily to our debt. The change in fair value of derivative liability reflects the change in fair value of the conversion features embedded in the convertible debt agreements entered into in August 2021, September 2021, and November 2021, and also includes the change in fair value of common share equivalents that were previously reclassified to derivative liability as a result of insufficient authorized but unissued shares.\nInterest expense increased during the year ended December 31 from $1,472,104 in 2020 to $1,675,726 in 2021 due to an increase in short term loans.\nNet Loss and Noncontrolling Interest\nSince we have incurred losses since inception, we have not recorded any income tax expense or benefit. Accordingly, our net loss is driven by our operating and other expenses. Noncontrolling interest represents the 5% third-party ownership in UPT, which is subtracted to calculate net loss to shareholders.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have historically met our liquidity requirements primarily through the public sale and private placement of equity securities, debt financing, and exchanging common stock warrants and options for professional and consulting services. On December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $72,391.\nWorking capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. We had negative working capital of $7,370,524 and $7,042,484 on December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The increase in negative working capital was due to increases in accrued interest payable, accrued payroll and current debt. To that end, we owe approximately $1,610,750 for convertible notes that mature in the next eleven months and we owe another $2,314,500 in notes payable. Based on its current forecast and budget, management believes that its cash resources will not be sufficient to fund its operations through the end of the second quarter. Unless the Company can generate sufficient revenue from the execution of the Company's business plan, it will need to obtain additional capital to continue to fund the Company's operations. There is no assurance that capital in any form would be available to us, and if available, on terms and conditions that are acceptable. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds, we may be forced to curtail and/or cease operations.\nSeptember Convertible Note -- On September 15, 2020, the Company signed a promissory note agreement with an accredited investor.

Our investing activity increased due to an increase in expenditure for intangible assets, which relates to the development of patents. Net cash provided by financing activities increased due to an increase in proceeds of debt or debt borrowings.\nThe Company's capital requirements for the next 12 months will consist of $3.8 million with anticipated expenses of $1.8 million for salaries, public company filings, and consultants and professional fees. An additional $2.0 million in working capital is expected to be needed for inventory and related costs for production of our mobile power generation systems as well as development and commercialization of our thermal dispersion technology applications.\nManagement believes the Company's funds are insufficient to provide for its projected needs for operations for the next 12 months. The Company is currently negotiating additional non-dilutive funding to support product development or for other purposes. In the event that the negotiations fail, the Company may have to rely on equity or debt financing that may involve substantial dilution to our then existing stockholders. If it is unable to close additional equity financing, the Company may have to cease operations.\nTable 63: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>39 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the amounts of revenues and expenses. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In applying these critical accounting policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in making certain estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe define critical accounting policies as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and which may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. In applying these critical accounting policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in making certain estimates. These estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nWhen facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of revenues and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized, if any, is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) exceeds the fair value. We may use a variety of methods to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use.\nIf actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to an impairment charge in the future.\nDerivative financial instruments\nWhen we issue debt that contains a conversion feature, we first evaluate whether the conversion feature meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative: a) one or more underlying, typically the price of the Company's stock; b) one or more notional amounts or payment provisions or both, generally the number of shares upon conversion; c) no initial net investment, which typically excludes the amount borrowed; and d) net settlement provisions, which in the case of convertible debt generally means the stock received upon conversion can be readily sold for cash. There are certain scope exceptions from derivative treatment, but these typically exclude conversion features that provide for a variable number of shares.\nWhen we issue warrants to purchase our common stock, we must evaluate whether they meet the requirements to be treated as a derivative. Generally, warrants would be treated as a derivative if the provisions of the warrant agreement create uncertainty as to a) the number of shares to be issued upon exercise; or b) whether shares may be issued upon exercise.\nIf the conversion feature within convertible debt or warrants meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative, we estimate the fair value of the derivative liability using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model upon the date of issuance. If the fair value of the derivative liability is higher than the face value of the convertible debt, the excess is immediately recognized as interest expense. Otherwise, the fair value of the derivative liability is recorded as a liability with an offsetting amount recorded as a debt discount, which offsets the carrying amount of the debt. The derivative liability is revalued at the end of each reporting period and any change in fair value is recorded as a change in fair value in the consolidated statement of operations. The debt discount is amortized through interest expense over the life of the debt. Derivative instrument liabilities and the host debt agreement are classified on the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve months of the balance sheet date.\nTable 64: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>40 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>\nThe accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record the embedded conversion option and warrants at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. The Company reassesses the classification of its derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification. As a result of entering into warrant agreements, for which such instruments contained a variable conversion feature with no floor, the Company has adopted a sequencing policy in accordance with ASC 815-40-35-12 whereby all future instruments may be classified as a derivative liability with the exception of instruments related to share-based compensation issued to employees or directors.\nContingent liabilities\nWe accrue a loss for contingencies if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred, and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimable. When no accrual is made because one or both conditions do not exist, we disclose the contingency if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. We estimate contingent liabilities based on the best information we have available at the time. If we have a range of possible outcomes, we accrue the low end of the range.\nShare-based Payments\nAll our share-based awards are classified as equity, as they may only be settled in shares of our common stock.\nWe recognize expense for fully-vested warrants at the time they are granted. For awards with service or performance conditions, we generally recognize expense when the service is complete; however, there may be circumstances in which we determine that the performance condition is probable before the actual performance condition is achieved. In such circumstances, the amount recognized as expense is the pro rata amount, depending on the estimated progress towards completion of the performance condition. Nonemployee share-based payments are measured at fair value, based on either the fair value of the equity instrument issued or on the fair value of the services received. Typically, it is not practical to value the services received, so we determine the fair value of common stock grants based on the price of the common stock on the measurement date, and the fair value of common stock warrants using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model ( Black-Scholes\u201d). We use historical data to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected stock option life and expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the stock option. For awards that are recognized when a performance condition is probable, the fair value is estimated at each reporting date. The cost ultimately recognized is the fair value of the equity award on the date the performance condition is achieved. Accordingly, the expense recognized may change between interim reporting dates and the date the performance condition is achieved.\nWe issue two types of common stock options to employees: 1) fully-vested at the time of grant and 2) market price-based vesting. We recognize expense for fully-vested stock options on the date of grant at the estimated fair value of the options using Black-Scholes. We recognize expense for market price-based options at the estimated fair value of the options using the lattice-based option valuation model ( Lattice Model\u201d) over the estimated life of the options used in the Lattice Model. We use historical data to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected stock option life and expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the stock option. In the event, we modify the terms of a non-vested share-based payment award, we would incur additional expense for the excess of the fair value of the modified share-based payment award over the fair value of the original share-based payment award. The incremental expense would be recognized ratably over the remaining vesting period.\nIncome taxes\nWe recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the income tax and financial reporting carrying amount of our assets and liabilities. We monitor our deferred tax assets and evaluate the need for a valuation allowance based on the estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets that we believe do not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria. We also evaluate whether we have any uncertain tax positions and would record a reserve if we believe it is more-likely-than-not our position would not prevail with the applicable tax authorities. We have significant net operating loss carryforwards, for which we have established a valuation allowance. If our estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets change, we may recognize a benefit in the future. UPT is a limited liability company ( LLC\u201d), which is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes, where all tax obligations flow through to the owners of the LLC during the period in which income taxes were incurred.\nTable 65: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>41 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur Management's Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes and pandemics; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; raw material costs and availability; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the SEC.\nBecause forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company is based upon, and should be read in conjunction with, the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPlan of Operation\nCool Technologies, Inc. and subsidiary, ( the Company\u201d or Cool Technologies\u201d or CoolTech\u201d) was incorporated in the State of Nevada in July 2002. In April 2014, CoolTech formed Ultimate Power Truck, LLC ( Ultimate Power Truck\u201d or UPT\u201d), of which the Company owns 95% and a shareholder of Cool Technologies owns 5%. Cool Technologies was formerly known as Bibb Corporation, as Z3 Enterprises, and as HPEV, Inc. On August 20, 2015, the Company changed its name to Cool Technologies, Inc.\n\nThe Company's technologies are divided into two distinct but complementary categories: mobile power generation and heat dispersion technology.\nThe Company has developed a mobile power generation system (eMGen) that enables work trucks to generate electric power by running an in-chassis generator. The eMGen system can be retrofit onto new and existing American trucks. CoolTech intends to sell the mobile electric power system to government, commercial and fleet vehicle owners. Sales are expected to occur through the direct efforts of the Company, its sales agents and its joint venture partners. CoolTech may also license the eMGen system as well.\nThe markets targeted include consumer, agricultural, industrial, military and emergency responders, both in the U.S. and worldwide.\nCoolTech has also developed heat dispersion technologies based on proprietary composite heat structures and heat pipe architecture in various product platforms such as electric motors, pumps, turbines, bearings and vehicle components. In preparation, Cool Technologies filed for and received a trademark for Totally Enclosed Heat Pipe Cooled: TEHPC.\nWhen a generator is enhanced by CoolTech's patented thermal technologies, it should be able to output more power than any other generator of its size on the market. That's because third party testing has demonstrated that the cooling provided by the thermal technologies can help increase the efficiency of electric motors.\nFurthermore, management believes that the technologies will increase the lifespan as well as help meet regulatory emissions standards for electric motors and other heat producing equipment and components. The simplicity of the heat pipe architecture as well as the fact that it provides effective new applications for existing manufacturing processes should enhance the cost structure in several large industries including motor/generator and engine manufacturing.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have seven US patents, two Canadian patents, one Mexican patent, one allowed Brazilian patent and one pending US patent application covering integrated electrical power generation methods and systems.\nThe Company intends to commercialize its patents by integrating the thermal technologies and applications with Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) partners and by licensing them to electric motor, generator, pump and vehicle component (brake, resistor, caliper) manufacturers.\nWe believe the benefits of our mobile power generation systems are quickly realized once potential customers see it in operation. Public demonstrations of the eMGen systems began in April 2017. An inspection and performance demonstration for Mexican government officials and business leaders occurred in May 2018. Feedback from initial viewers resulted in more government officials and fruit growers coming to see the eMGen power equipment and to learn about the water purification options in March 2019. Even more officials and growers followed -- flying to St. Louis for a review in May 2019.\nCraftsmen Industries was selected to produce the first systems due to its engineering capabilities and extensive facilities. In January 2019, it began production on the initial vehicles and completed an initial production run vehicle two months later.\nWhile the Company awaits funding to begin continuous production, it has continued to expand its contacts with potential clients -- meeting with government agencies, emergency responders and city officials as well as military engineers and procurement specialists. Specifications for custom applications have been noted and preliminary designs drawn up.\n\nWe have not generated any revenues to date. Consequently, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to generate new orders nor fulfill the existing ones nor address all the requirements of all the interested parties.\nManagement is pursuing various financing alternatives, based upon a third-party assessment of the historically demonstrated or contractually committed profit-earning capacities of our IP. We see this as the best path forward for non-dilutive funding.\nIf funding is received, it will be used to support completion of the initial phases of our business plan, which is to license our thermal technologies and applications; to license or sell a mobile electric power system; and to license our submersible motor dry pit technologies and/or to bring to market our technologies and applications through key distribution and joint venture partners. As of the filing date, it is uncertain whether COVID-19 will continue to have a significant impact on production and distribution of Company products.\nThe occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic and its subsequent variants has negatively affected our operations over the past year. A pandemic typically results in social distancing, travel bans, lockdowns and quarantines. This has limited access to our facilities, customers, management, support staff and professional advisors. These, in turn, have impacted our operations and financial condition. It may also impact demand for our products and may continue to hamper our efforts to provide our investors with timely information and comply with our filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSignificant Developments\nAmendment of Series B Preferred Stock\nOn October 31, 2016, the Company filed an amended and restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (which was originally filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada on April 19, 2016 and amended on August 12, 2016) to designate 3,636,360 shares as Series B Preferred Stock and to provide for supermajority 66 2/3% voting rights for the Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock will not bear dividends, will not be entitled to receive any distributions in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, and will have no other preferences, rights, restrictions, or qualifications, except as otherwise provided by law or the articles of incorporation of the Company. The holders of Class B Stock shall have the right, at such holder's option, at any time to convert such shares into common stock, in a conversion ratio of one share of common stock for each share of Class B Stock. If the common stock trades or is quoted at a price per share in excess of $2.25 for any twenty consecutive day trading period, (subject to appropriate adjustment for forward or reverse stock splits, recapitalizations, stock dividends and the like), the Series B Stock will automatically be convertible into the common stock in a conversion ratio of one share of common stock for each share of Series B Stock. The Series B Stock may not be sold, hypothecated, transferred, assigned or disposed without the prior written consent of the Company and the holders of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock.\nAmendment of Articles of Incorporation\nWe filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada increasing our authorized shares of common stock, from 140,000,000 shares to 350,000,000 shares, effective March 22, 2017. We filed a second amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada increasing our authorized shares of common stock, from 350,000,000 shares to 500,000,000 shares, effective October 28, 2019.\nOn February 13, 2020, stockholders holding shares that entitled them to exercise at least a majority of the voting power, voted in favor of increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock, from 500,000,000 shares to 1,000,000,000 shares. The vote marked the first step in the process to amend the articles again.\n\nCraftsmen Industries, Inc.\nAs a consequence of the first public demonstration of the eMGen 30 kilovolt amp ( kVA\u201d) system at the North America International Auto Show in Detroit in January 2017, the Company entered into an agreement in principle, dated February 21, 2017, with Craftsmen Industries, Inc.( Craftsmen'), a company engaged in the design, engineering and production of mobile marketing vehicles, experiential marketing platforms and industrial mobile solutions.\nOn April 25, 2017, we delivered to Craftsmen Industries, a Class III Vehicle (Ford dually) up-fitted with a production-ready eMGen 30 kVA (single phase/three phase) system.\nSubsequently, Craftsmen invited the Company to demonstrate its mobile generation technology and the potential benefits for Craftsmen products at Craftsmen's 35th Anniversary Party on April 27, 2017. Over 100 current and prospective Craftsmen customers were in the audience for the demonstrations.\nCraftsmen recently signed a manufacturing contract with Translux-Fair Play. Translux' Hazelwood, Missouri facility encompasses over 45,000 square feet of manufacturing space and offers extensive laser cutting and metal bending machinery. The contract significantly enhances Craftsmen's capabilities to produce boxes and control panels for the eMGen Systems and the vehicles they're upfitted to, but also all the eMGen's optional tasks and capabilities, including welding, water purification and solar power.\nNot only will basic production be optimized and improved, but control panels and displays should be upgraded. CoolTech is expected to benefit from Translux' electronics expertise which has been refined through their years of manufacturing digital scoring panels for sporting arenas and ball parks.\nAon Risk Services Central, Inc and Lee and Hayes, PLLC\nOn January 18, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with Aon Risk Services Central, Inc. and Lee and Hayes, PLLC, through its operating unit, 601West, which provides intellectual property ( IP\u201d) analytics, to assess the value of the Company's IP. As set forth in the agreement, the assessment will be founded on historically demonstrated or contractually committed profit-earning capacities of our IP and may be used to obtain financing, including but not limited to, non-dilutive financing. Since then, significant progress has been achieved, although at a pace much slower than anticipated.\nLive eMGen 80 Demonstration in Fort Collins, Colorado\nOn May 4, 2018, nine representatives from Mexico's farming, banking, and government sectors flew to Fort Collins, Colorado for a live demonstration of CoolTech's generator-equipped truck. The demonstration showcased the capabilities and ease of operation of the system. The Company demonstrated how an operator is able to control the generator from the comfort and safety of the truck's cab using a Panasonic Toughpad. The Company also used the electricity from the truck to power a screw compressor, an industrial fan, and an industrial load bank. Additional capabilities, such as purifying water and using batteries and solar power to make operations more sustainable and environmentally friendly were discussed with the attendees.\nA representative from one of the Mexican farming producers' unions approved the generator-equipped truck. CoolTech plans to put this into production as soon as final funding is secured.\nPurchase and Delivery of Truck to Craftsman Industries\nOn July 15, 2018, the Company purchased a Ford Chassis Cab Truck. Subsequently, a metal flatbed was manufactured and installed. The truck was delivered to Craftsmen on September 15, 2018. It will be used for the installation and refinement of the eMGen 80 kVA system. A second will be used for the eMGen 125 kVA system.\n\nOrder of Parts and Components\nDuring the week of October 7, 2018, the Company placed orders for System Controllers, 80 and 125 kVA Generators, Voltage Regulators, Panasonic Toughpads, Power Take-Offs (PTO) and Split Shaft PTOs.\nAs of September 2021, the Company has acquired enough parts and components to build 5 eMGen 80s and 2 eMGen 125s. It is currently procuring two mobile water purification systems and components for mobile electric vehicle charging systems.\nIn addition, the Company has purchased another Ford and is seeking to acquire mores and 550s for use in demonstrations of the capabilities noted above and for initial order fulfillment.\nUnveiling of Initial Production Run Vehicle\nOn March 27, 2019, the Company unveiled the initial production run of its mobile power generation (eMGen) work trucks for inspection by an audience of agricultural and community leaders from Latin America at Craftsmen Industries.\nThe itinerary for the showcase event included a tour of the St. Louis manufacturing facility and inspection of the first production run eMGen vehicle in operation as it powered a variety of equipment.\nThe purpose of the viewing was not only to show the truck's capabilities, but to get feedback from the attendees.\nMexico's population is expected to grow from 129 million to nearly 150 million by 2050. As a result, energy and water demand should increase significantly.\nIncreased water demand for both human consumption and agricultural production, along with lagging water management practices have resulted in a rapid depletion of water reserves in Mexico, particularly in Northern Mexico. The forecast of high temperatures in the summer combined with a developing La Nina weather pattern could prolong an existing drought and spread water shortages.\nAccording to the North American Drought Monitor from the University of Nebraska, as of February 2022, Northern Mexico is abnormally dry with pockets of moderate to severe drought. (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/nadm/home/NADMByArea.aspx?MX)\nLast year was particularly bad for the country. In June 2021, nearly 85% of Mexico was dangerously dry. The National Water Commission (CONAGUA) reported that 1,295 municipalities experienced drought conditions and 77 of 210 principal reservoirs were below 25% capacity, especially in the north.\nWith reservoirs drying and ground water levels declining, water is at a premium. In many locations, sewage water is reused for irrigation. Water treatment is scarce and pollution regulations are rarely enforced.\nAs long as investment in wastewater treatment lags behind population growth, large numbers of consumers eating raw produce face heightened threats to food safety from diseases such as salmonella, E Coli and roundworm. Add unchecked or minimally treated industrial pollution and unusually large numbers of cases of cancer and kidney problems have been documented in consumers living near polluted waterways.\nWhile access to electricity is high across the nation, in rural areas, power can be sporadic or even non-existent. Many communities, particularly in regions populated by indigenous people, are still not connected to the grid. They rely on diesel generators to light homes and draw water from shrinking aquifers.\n\nInterest from Mexican authorities is high in the eMGen systems as they seek to mitigate the effects of drought and guarantee access to drinking water as well as provide a consistent source of electricity and mobile medical services for underserved populations.\nThrough the efforts of its representatives in the country, the Company has been in contact with and in some cases made presentations to the national water commission (CONAQUA) as well as cabinet secretaries, senators, representatives and deputies at the federal level; to governors, legislators, commissioners and municipal presidents at the state level and to mayors and county and local politicians in cities and towns beset by energy and water problems. Private entities such as distilleries, fruit growers, cattle rancher's associations and mining companies have also requested information.\nConversations are ongoing and interested politicians are helping to promote, coordinate and refine the Company's approach to secure funding for pilot programs, full blown projects and purchases of eMGen systems and vehicles.\nMexican Government\nOn May 13, 2019, government officials and fruit growers were at Craftsmen Industries in St. Louis for a review of a first run eMGen 80 production vehicle and water purification/desalination options.\nAmong the politicians in attendance was Congressman Efra\u00edn Rocha Vega who is Secretary of the Commission of Development and Rural, Agricultural and Food Self-sufficiency Conservation, a member of the commission of Livestock and the commission of Environment, Sustainability, Climate Change and Natural Resources. Subsequent to the event, in an official Congressional Letter of Support, dated May 20, 2019, Congressman Rocha wrote: The successful demonstration of these technologies further strengthens the Mexican Government's support of Mexican entities that desire to purchase CoolTech products, as well as affirms our position to provide financial assistance to such entities.\u201d The letter can be viewed in its entirety at: http://www.cooltechnologiesinc.com/content/pdf/MexicanLegislationandFinancialAssistanceLetter.pdf.\nIntroduction of new options\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company has introduced new options, which include an eMGen System that generates up to 200 kVA of electric power, water purification and desalination systems.\nThe Company's mobile electric generation system ( eMGen\u201d) offers optional 30 to 125 kVA water purification and desalination units capable of producing 2,800 to 14,000 gallons of potable water per day. Assuming the average person needs 2 liters per day, 10,000 gallons is enough for 26,498 people. If delivery is required, an eMGen truck can also tow a water tanker.\nThe truck-mounted units cleanse contaminated, polluted and wastewater or remove saline from saltwater. Submerge the input pipe into any water source. Chemicals, particulates, salts, heavy metals, bacteria, viruses and other impurities are removed. Six levels of water purification output a range of water qualities from clean potable water for drinking and cooking tor non-potable water for agricultural or other commercial and emergency usage.\nThe eMGen systems as well as the purification and desalinization units feature fully automated controls and monitoring. A Panasonic Toughpad tablet provides a rugged touchscreen interface for operation from the truck cab or anywhere within a 300 foot radius. When outfitted with the optional telematics package, the systems can be remotely controlled and monitored from distant locations.\nThe next generation of eMGens will include a solar-powered generator system with a built-in water purification unit that makes seawater desalination sustainable. The system pumps and purifies up to 4,500 gallons of potable water per day. It can be set up and operated anywhere a four-wheel drive vehicle can go. Once the batteries are drained, the systems shift to fuel power for 24 hour operation. The solar panels collapse and fold, so the entire system fits easily in the bed of a work truck.\n\nRugged, reliable and versatile, the eMGen trucks are designed to operate in extreme environments. A variety of capabilities handle a variety of needs including:\n\nThe applications for hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters are obvious, others less so.\nHere are a few common yet relatively unknown problems the system and units address:\n\nConsider the Texas Freeze in February of 2021. Power failures at water treatment plants necessitated boil water orders. Burst pipes and dripping faucets dropped water reserves to dangerously low levels.\nMore than 800 public water systems serving 162 of the state's 254 counties were disrupted. Over 13 million people were left without safe drinking water. The town of Kyle almost went dry.\nCities opened water distribution sites, water was trucked in to flush toilets, homeowners melted icicles and snow for drinking water, medical workers resorted to using bottled water for chemotherapy treatments.\nKeyOptions\nOn May 30, 2019, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement ( JV\u201d) with KeyOptions Pty Ltd., a privately held technology and security provider based in Victoria, Australia.\nKeyOptions develops and markets products for governments, defense contractors and other commercial applications to counter security and cyber threats. The Company will provide a license for the JV to market and sell CoolTech's entire product platform in Australia and neighboring countries in Southeast Asia.\nNew Strategic Alliance:\nOn December 16, 2019, the Company signed a cross marketing and licensing agreement with VerdeWatts, LLC., an energy generation and storage company encompassing everything from mobile solar power generation systems to large scale biogas turbine installations. Pursuant to the agreement VerdeWatts and the Company each granted the other a royalty free non-exclusive license to certain patents which license is subject to certain future negotiation.\nLike CoolTech's mobile power generation systems ( eMGen\u201d), VerdeWatts' products are scalable and offer the ability to bring power nearly anywhere it is needed. Their proprietary Smart Solar Power Generation Units and energy storage systems combine to deliver sustainable power long after the sun has set.\n\nThe agreement with VerdeWatts also included a cross marketing and royalty free non-exclusive licensing agreement with FirmGreen, Inc., a water treatment facilities developer that works closely with VerdeWatts to create a suite of synergistic products that address significant needs in the global marketplace. FirmGreen specializes in water purification and desalination technologies. Their mobile, solar and container applications feature 6 levels of water purification for unrivaled drinkability. Pursuant to the agreement FirmGreen and the Company each granted the other a royalty free non-exclusive license to certain patents which license is subject to certain future negotiation.\nCoolTech's eMGen platform makes the companies' product offering complete with mobile power generation. It provides the capability to power everything from irrigation for farms and water purification for rural areas to electric vehicle charging and fast charging in the urban ones.\nConsider the solar-powered generator system with a built-in water purification unit that makes seawater desalination sustainable. The system pumps and purifies up to 3,000 gallons per day and interfaces with CoolTech's eMGen system for 24-hour operation. The solar panels collapse and fold together, so the entire system fits easily in the bed of a work truck. It can be set up and operate anywhere a four-wheel drive vehicle can reach. All of these systems are patent protected and cross licensed to each of the three companies.\nFirmGreen and VerdeWatts have a global presence with projects on 3 continents. The largest encompasses the installation of 14 natural gas generators to produce over 60 megawatts (MW) of power. The generators will be integrated with 50 megawatt hours of battery storage and another 6 MW of solar to ensure a consistent flow of power. VerdeWatts intend to replace most of the legacy on-site generators with CoolTech's eMGen systems, however the Company has not received any orders and there cannot be any assurance that any orders will be placed.\nTogether the companies can create an energy or utility ecosystem that can enable less developed countries to leapfrog non-existent, inadequate or failing infrastructure to deliver reliable power and water quickly, sustainably and cost effectively to their citizens, agriculture and other businesses. The scale and impact can reach from the individual farms and villages to cities and regions.\nIn fact, by combining their respective technologies: energy generation, energy storage and load management controls into a single suite of products, the companies create what is called a microgrid\u201d. Varying combinations of energy sources such as solar, wind, biogas and eMGen systems both backup and supplement one another to provide consistent, uninterrupted primary power even during severe weather or other emergency situations.\nThe synergies between the companies extend beyond water purification and power generation. VerdeWatts' wind and gas turbines and generators which produce electric power can all be improved by CoolTech's thermal reduction technologies.\nRequest for Collaboration Sent to US Government Officials\nOn December 11, 2019, letters signed by 13 government officials and Congressmen in Mexico were mailed to their counterparts in the US, specifically Governor Gavin Newsom, Secretary Rick Perry, Secretary Wilbur Ross, Senator Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.\nThe letters were a request for collaborative support between the two countries to accelerate CoolTech's product deployment into Mexico to help solve urgent rural power and water purification problems that are hurting rural communities. Those problems include irregular and faulty power in rural areas which hinders crop irrigation and water pollution which affects crops farmed for sale to the US.\nThe letters also detail the Mexican officials' satisfaction with CoolTech's solutions and management team and that they have met with the Company on several occasions for product demonstrations as well as strategic and technical advice. They highlight the benefits of CoolTech products, how they could quickly and efficiently address the problems noted, and how they expect them to become a viable part of the country's infrastructure.\nExport Import Bank of the United States\nWith the help of VerdeWatts and FirmGreen, CoolTech has initiated a relationship with the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), a U.S. government agency whose sole mission is to support U.S. exports. The bank fulfills its mission by offering very cost-effective financing for international customers and project developers to purchase U.S.-made services and purchase or lease U.S.-made goods.\n\nTo that end, the two companies applied to finance the Mexican projects referenced above. CoolTech also sent product information for due diligence review by the technical team at EXIM bank. Subsequently, CoolTech has received a Letter of Interest from EXIM, however, there cannot be any assurance that EXIM will provide any funding to the Company.\nIncrease in Number of Authorized Shares\nOn August 10, 2020, the Nevada Secretary of State accepted and filed the Company's Certificate of Amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation. The filing amends Article II of the Articles of Incorporation by increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock from 500,000,000 to 1,000,000,000.\nNew Sales Agent\nIn January 2021, the Company terminated its independent agent agreement with Gaia Energy of Gdansk, Poland.\nOn January 26, 2021, the Company signed an independent agent agreement with H&K Ventures, LLC of Morganhill, California. H&K will act as the Company's independent agent.\nThe principals of H&K were also part of Gaia Energy. Consequently, the agreement and the expertise provided by H&K are essentially the same. H&K will concentrate on developing markets in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The agreement describes the agent's duties as generating revenue, and investment funding, for the Company from various organizations including investment funds, end-users, channel partners, integrators, and OEMs.\u201d To that end, H&K has requested quotes from the Company for eMGen 200 to 300 kVA systems with mobile water desalination capabilities of up to 900,000 gallons per day.\nTeam members of H&K Ventures include executives with more than twenty-five years' experience with Panasonic, Ford Motor Company, Electronic Data Systems and the US Air Force in the fields of advanced technologies and an African diplomat with a thirty-year background working with and for diplomatic missions, non-governmental organizations and international disasters and aid management services.\nThe former has joined the Company's advisory board while the diplomat introduced CoolTech products at a recent African technical summit attended by representatives from 54 countries.\nOrder and Delivery of Water Units and Charger\nOver the past six months, the Company has ordered two reverse osmosis water purification units and an electric vehicles charger.\nIn May of 2021, the Company ordered a reverse osmosis system capable of treating 4,500 gallons of brackish water per day. That was followed by a 100 kW, mode 4 DC, electric vehicle charger capable of simultaneous charging and dynamic load distribution. The Company ordered a second reverse osmosis system capable of treating 4,500 gallons of brackish water per day in July of 2021.\nThe units were delivered to Craftsmen Industries for installation in the beds of the three test vehicles referenced in Note 3.\nGoing Concern\nAs a result of our financial condition, we have received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm for our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 that includes an explanatory paragraph describing the uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2021, we have not commenced full operations, raising substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to generate revenue, achieve profitable operations and repay our obligations when they come due. As of December 31, 2021, we have $72,391 in cash and we owe $1,610,750 and $2,314,500 for convertible and promissory notes, respectively. We are pursuing various financing alternatives to address the payment of outstanding debt and to support the sales, component acquisition and assembly of our mobile power generation systems as well as the completion of the secondary elements of our business plan: to license its thermal technologies and applications, including submersible dry-pit applications. There can be no assurance, however, that we will obtain adequate funding or that we will be successful in accomplishing any of our objectives. Consequently, we may not be able to continue as an operating company.\n\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, consolidated statements of operations data. The table and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this report.\n\nRevenues\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, and since inception, we have not generated any revenues. We generated our first Mobile Generation order during the quarter ended June 30, 2014 and received a partial deposit in advance of completing the sale with companies controlled by the individual who is a 5% owner of UPT and a shareholder of our Company. The order is in the production queue.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, due to increases in consulting costs, professional fees as well as general and administrative.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, payroll and related expenses decreased by $12,311 due a reduction in accrued payroll taxes.\n\nConsulting expenses increased from $316,068 in 2020 to $467,241 in 2021. The increase is due to the sales and engineering consulting that were hired at the end of the 2020.\nProfessional fees increased from $224,453 in 2020 to $254,793 in 2021. The increase reflects an uptick in the number of filings required by the Company's legal representatives to defend the Company against the eviction complaint and an arbitration proceeding.\nThe minor increase in research and development expenses from $19,069 in 2020 to $19,853 in 2021 reflects the completion of the design of the eMGen system and the Company's focus on its commercialization.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased from $68,309 in 2020 to $87,064 in 2021 due to limited funds.\nOther Income and Expense\nInterest expense during the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 related primarily to our debt. The change in fair value of derivative liability reflects the change in fair value of the conversion features embedded in the convertible debt agreements entered into in August 2021, September 2021, and November 2021, and also includes the change in fair value of common share equivalents that were previously reclassified to derivative liability as a result of insufficient authorized but unissued shares.\nInterest expense increased during the year ended December 31 from $1,472,104 in 2020 to $1,675,726 in 2021 due to an increase in short term loans.\nNet Loss and Noncontrolling Interest\nSince we have incurred losses since inception, we have not recorded any income tax expense or benefit. Accordingly, our net loss is driven by our operating and other expenses. Noncontrolling interest represents the 5% third-party ownership in UPT, which is subtracted to calculate net loss to shareholders.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have historically met our liquidity requirements primarily through the public sale and private placement of equity securities, debt financing, and exchanging common stock warrants and options for professional and consulting services. On December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $72,391.\nWorking capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. We had negative working capital of $7,370,524 and $7,042,484 on December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The increase in negative working capital was due to increases in accrued interest payable, accrued payroll and current debt. To that end, we owe approximately $1,610,750 for convertible notes that mature in the next eleven months and we owe another $2,314,500 in notes payable. Based on its current forecast and budget, management believes that its cash resources will not be sufficient to fund its operations through the end of the second quarter. Unless the Company can generate sufficient revenue from the execution of the Company's business plan, it will need to obtain additional capital to continue to fund the Company's operations. There is no assurance that capital in any form would be available to us, and if available, on terms and conditions that are acceptable. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds, we may be forced to curtail and/or cease operations.\nSeptember Convertible Note -- On September 15, 2020, the Company signed a promissory note agreement with an accredited investor.

It received $33,000 after an original issue discount of $3,000 in lieu of interest. The total amount of $33,000 plus 3% interest or $990 will be due on September 20, 2022. After 180 days, at the holder's option, a portion or all of the unpaid principal and interest may be converted into shares of common stock at a fixed price of $0.02 per share. In the event of default, the outstanding balance will increase by 25% and a daily penalty of $100 will accrue until the default is remedied. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining balance totaled $33,000 in principal and accrued interest.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCash Flows\nOur cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities were as follows:\n\nNet cash from operating activities increased due to increases in non-cash interest expense, in fair value of derivative liability and in accrued payroll taxes. Our investing activity increased due to an increase in expenditure for intangible assets, which relates to the development of patents. Net cash provided by financing activities increased due to an increase in proceeds of debt or debt borrowings.\nThe Company's capital requirements for the next 12 months will consist of $3.8 million with anticipated expenses of $1.8 million for salaries, public company filings, and consultants and professional fees. An additional $2.0 million in working capital is expected to be needed for inventory and related costs for production of our mobile power generation systems as well as development and commercialization of our thermal dispersion technology applications.\nManagement believes the Company's funds are insufficient to provide for its projected needs for operations for the next 12 months. The Company is currently negotiating additional non-dilutive funding to support product development or for other purposes. In the event that the negotiations fail, the Company may have to rely on equity or debt financing that may involve substantial dilution to our then existing stockholders. If it is unable to close additional equity financing, the Company may have to cease operations.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the amounts of revenues and expenses. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In applying these critical accounting policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in making certain estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe define critical accounting policies as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and which may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. In applying these critical accounting policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in making certain estimates. These estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nWhen facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of revenues and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized, if any, is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) exceeds the fair value. We may use a variety of methods to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use.\nIf actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to an impairment charge in the future.\nDerivative financial instruments\nWhen we issue debt that contains a conversion feature, we first evaluate whether the conversion feature meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative: a) one or more underlying, typically the price of the Company's stock; b) one or more notional amounts or payment provisions or both, generally the number of shares upon conversion; c) no initial net investment, which typically excludes the amount borrowed; and d) net settlement provisions, which in the case of convertible debt generally means the stock received upon conversion can be readily sold for cash. There are certain scope exceptions from derivative treatment, but these typically exclude conversion features that provide for a variable number of shares.\nWhen we issue warrants to purchase our common stock, we must evaluate whether they meet the requirements to be treated as a derivative. Generally, warrants would be treated as a derivative if the provisions of the warrant agreement create uncertainty as to a) the number of shares to be issued upon exercise; or b) whether shares may be issued upon exercise.\nIf the conversion feature within convertible debt or warrants meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative, we estimate the fair value of the derivative liability using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model upon the date of issuance. If the fair value of the derivative liability is higher than the face value of the convertible debt, the excess is immediately recognized as interest expense. Otherwise, the fair value of the derivative liability is recorded as a liability with an offsetting amount recorded as a debt discount, which offsets the carrying amount of the debt. The derivative liability is revalued at the end of each reporting period and any change in fair value is recorded as a change in fair value in the consolidated statement of operations. The debt discount is amortized through interest expense over the life of the debt. Derivative instrument liabilities and the host debt agreement are classified on the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve months of the balance sheet date.\n\nThe accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record the embedded conversion option and warrants at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. The Company reassesses the classification of its derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification. As a result of entering into warrant agreements, for which such instruments contained a variable conversion feature with no floor, the Company has adopted a sequencing policy in accordance with ASC 815-40-35-12 whereby all future instruments may be classified as a derivative liability with the exception of instruments related to share-based compensation issued to employees or directors.\nContingent liabilities\nWe accrue a loss for contingencies if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred, and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimable. When no accrual is made because one or both conditions do not exist, we disclose the contingency if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. We estimate contingent liabilities based on the best information we have available at the time. If we have a range of possible outcomes, we accrue the low end of the range.\nShare-based Payments\nAll our share-based awards are classified as equity, as they may only be settled in shares of our common stock.\nWe recognize expense for fully-vested warrants at the time they are granted. For awards with service or performance conditions, we generally recognize expense when the service is complete; however, there may be circumstances in which we determine that the performance condition is probable before the actual performance condition is achieved. In such circumstances, the amount recognized as expense is the pro rata amount, depending on the estimated progress towards completion of the performance condition. Nonemployee share-based payments are measured at fair value, based on either the fair value of the equity instrument issued or on the fair value of the services received. Typically, it is not practical to value the services received, so we determine the fair value of common stock grants based on the price of the common stock on the measurement date, and the fair value of common stock warrants using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model ( Black-Scholes\u201d). We use historical data to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected stock option life and expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the stock option. For awards that are recognized when a performance condition is probable, the fair value is estimated at each reporting date. The cost ultimately recognized is the fair value of the equity award on the date the performance condition is achieved. Accordingly, the expense recognized may change between interim reporting dates and the date the performance condition is achieved.\nWe issue two types of common stock options to employees: 1) fully-vested at the time of grant and 2) market price-based vesting. We recognize expense for fully-vested stock options on the date of grant at the estimated fair value of the options using Black-Scholes. We recognize expense for market price-based options at the estimated fair value of the options using the lattice-based option valuation model ( Lattice Model\u201d) over the estimated life of the options used in the Lattice Model. We use historical data to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected stock option life and expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the stock option. In the event, we modify the terms of a non-vested share-based payment award, we would incur additional expense for the excess of the fair value of the modified share-based payment award over the fair value of the original share-based payment award. The incremental expense would be recognized ratably over the remaining vesting period.\nIncome taxes\nWe recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the income tax and financial reporting carrying amount of our assets and liabilities. We monitor our deferred tax assets and evaluate the need for a valuation allowance based on the estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets that we believe do not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria. We also evaluate whether we have any uncertain tax positions and would record a reserve if we believe it is more-likely-than-not our position would not prevail with the applicable tax authorities. We have significant net operating loss carryforwards, for which we have established a valuation allowance. If our estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets change, we may recognize a benefit in the future. UPT is a limited liability company ( LLC\u201d), which is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes, where all tax obligations flow through to the owners of the LLC during the period in which income taxes were incurred.\n", "item_7_tables": "Table 46: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>26 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>Table 47: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>27 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>Table 48: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>28 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>Table 49: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>29 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>Table 50: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>30 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>Table 51: <table><tbody><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>31 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>Table 52: <table><tbody><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7\n</td> <td>agriculture, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7\n</td> <td>municipalities, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7\n</td> <td>mining, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7\n</td> <td>emergency response, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7\n</td> <td>and disaster relief. </td> </tr>\n</tbody></table>Table 53: <table><tbody><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7\n</td> <td>In poorly served or third world countries, irregular power service prevents farmers from irrigating on a regular schedule which reduces the size of the harvest. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7\n</td> <td>In areas where water tables are dropping, powerful pumps are required to pull water up from deep underground.

MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- Cool Technologies is a development stage company focused on mobile power generation systems (eMGen) and heat dispersion technologies. It has not generated any revenue to date.\n\n- The company has developed a mobile electric generator system that can be installed on trucks and has applied for patents related to integrated electrical power generation methods and systems.\n\n- Cool Technologies intends to sell/license the eMGen system and its thermal technologies to various customers including government, commercial entities, and emergency responders.\n\nFinancial Condition\n- As of December 31, 2021, Cool Technologies had negative working capital of $7.4 million and owes $1.6 million for convertible notes and $2.3 million for promissory notes maturing over the next 11 months.\n\n- The company has not generated any revenue and has incurred significant losses since inception. It requires additional capital from financing or generating revenue to continue operations.\n\n2021 Financial Results\n- No revenues were generated in 2021 or 2020. Operating expenses increased by 19% in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increases in consulting costs and interest expense.\n\n- Net loss for 2021 was $3.4 million compared to $2.7 million in 2020. The increased net loss was mainly driven by higher non-cash interest expense and changes in fair value of derivative liabilities.\n\nLiquidity Outlook\n- Cool Technologies estimates it will need $3.8 million in capital over the next 12 months and may have to rely on equity/debt financing. Without additional financing, it may have to cease operations.\n\n- In 2021, the company raised $1.7 million through various convertible note agreements to provide working capital and fund operations.\n\nThat summarizes the key points from the MD&A report on Cool Technologies' business, financial condition and outlook.
