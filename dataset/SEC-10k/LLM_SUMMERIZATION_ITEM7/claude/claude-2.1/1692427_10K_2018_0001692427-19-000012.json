Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as of, and for, the periods presented. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the sections entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d -Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Item 6. Selected Historical Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This section and other parts of the Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements regarding the industry outlook, estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial and industry trends that may affect our future results of operations or financial condition and other non-historical statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties described in -Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\n\ufeff\nOverview and Outlook\n\ufeff\nWe are a leading provider of highly engineered products and support services that facilitate the optimization of oil and natural gas well completions and field development strategies. We provide our products and services primarily to E&P companies for use in onshore wells, predominantly wells that have been drilled with horizontal laterals in unconventional oil and natural gas formations. Our products and services are utilized in oil and natural gas basins throughout North America and in selected international markets, including Argentina, China, Russia and the North Sea. We provided our products and services to over 310 customers in 2018, including leading large independent oil and natural gas companies and major oil companies.\n\ufeff\nOur primary offering is our fracturing systems products and services, which enable efficient pinpoint stimulation: the process of individually stimulating each entry point into a formation targeted by an oil or natural gas well. Our fracturing systems products and services are typically utilized in cemented wellbores and enable our customers to precisely place stimulation treatments in a more controlled and repeatable manner as compared with traditional completion techniques. Our fracturing systems products and services are utilized in conjunction with third-party providers of pressure pumping, coiled tubing and other services.\n\ufeff\nWe sell products for well construction, including our AirLock casing buoyancy system, liner hanger systems and toe initiation sleeves. We provide tracer diagnostics services for well completion and reservoir characterization that utilize downhole chemical and radioactive tracers and consult on reservoir strategies by providing engineering services. Repeat Precision sells composite frac plugs and related products and provides third-party manufacturing services. We operate in one reportable segment.\n\ufeff\nBased on recent commodity prices and preliminary budgets set by E&P companies, we believe that industry drilling and completions activity in North America will be lower in 2019 than it was in 2018. Many of our customers in North America have begun to prioritize free cash flow and the return of capital to shareholders over production growth, which is leading to lower levels of capital expenditures. This is due in part to relatively low commodity prices at the time our customers established their budgets and also concerns over global demand for oil and natural gas based on macroeconomic conditions. We expect customer activity in the U.S. to decline slightly on a year-over-year basis, with activity levels declining in early 2019 from year-end 2018 levels, with the possibility for activity to improve over the course of the year. We believe that customer activity in Canada could be significantly below levels seen in prior years, especially in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter in prior years. This is due to the factors mentioned above and also due to elevated commodity price differentials and mandatory production curtailments imposed on certain operators in Alberta. Market conditions in Canada have resulted in continued customer and competitor-driven pricing pressure for our products and services, negatively impacting our margins and market share in certain markets. We currently expect international activity to increase slightly in 2019 as market conditions remain more constructive than in North America.\n\ufeff\nMarket Conditions\n\ufeff\nOil and Natural Gas Drilling and Completion Activity\n\ufeff\nOur products and services are primarily sold to North American E&P companies and our ability to generate revenues from our products and services depends upon oil and natural gas drilling and production activity in North America. Oil and natural gas drilling and production activity is directly related to oil and natural gas prices.\n\ufeff\nOil and natural gas prices remain volatile, with WTI crude oil pricing falling to a low of approximately $26 per barrel in February 2016 before recovering to approximately $60 per barrel by the end of December 2017 and then falling again to approximately $45 per barrel by the end of December 2018. Crude oil pricing has been supported by voluntary oil production reductions by members of OPEC, and certain other countries, including Russia. These supply reductions were announced in November 2016 and were initially implemented in 2017. In November 2017, OPEC and certain other countries, including Russia, announced their intent to extend the supply reductions through the end of 2018. These countries had reduced their supply by more than the targeted amounts through early 2018, reaching 152% of targeted supply reductions in May 2018. In June 2018, OPEC and certain\nother countries, including Russia, announced that they would strive to conform with the supply reductions at a 100% level as of July 1, 2018, signaling an increase in production from prior levels. In response to falling crude oil prices in late 2018, OPEC and certain other countries, including Russia, agreed to a new round of supply reductions in December 2018, which were intended to be effective as of January 2019. There can be no assurance that the countries involved will continue to comply with the intended reductions and the amount of oil supply that may be returned to the market if the supply reductions are not extended further is unknown.\n\ufeff\nOn August 6, 2018, the United States announced its intent to impose economic sanctions on Iran, following the United States' withdrawal from an international accord intended to limit Iran's nuclear programs. The sanctions, including secondary sanctions targeting companies that do business with Iran, are expected to reduce Iran's level of crude oil exports and went into effect in early November. However, the United States granted temporary waivers to eight countries that import oil from Iran. Other oil exporting countries, including Saudi Arabia and Russia have committed to increase oil supplies to offset any shortfall related to a reduction in Iranian oil exports. There can be no assurance in the level of reduction of Iranian crude exports, the expiration of the temporary waivers or of the ability of other countries to readily supply crude oil to the market if Iranian crude exports decline materially.\n\ufeff\nOver the course of 2018, there was an increase in the difference between the benchmark crude oil pricing in certain markets and WTI, known in the industry as differentials. Crude oil in certain areas, including West Texas, North Dakota and Canada have traded at a larger discount to WTI than in historical periods due to current and forecasted production levels that are in excess of local refining demand and pipeline capacity. In response to these price differentials, many E&P companies operating in these areas reduced their drilling and completion activity in the second half of 2018 and into 2019 or chose to delay completions until additional pipeline or rail capacity is placed into service. In Canada, the Province of Alberta implemented a number of measures intended to reduce the differential in the region, including supporting the purchase of railcars to be utilized to transport oil out of the province and by implementing mandatory production curtailments for companies producing more than 10,000 barrels per day in the province.\n\ufeff\nNatural gas pricing reached a low of approximately $1.50 per MMBtu in March 2016 before recovering to an average level of approximately $3.15 per MMBtu during 2018. Realized natural gas prices for Canadian E&P customers are typically at a discount to U.S. Henry Hub pricing. Spot pricing for Canadian natural gas at the AECO hub has been volatile since mid-2017, with wider-than-normal discounts to Henry Hub pricing resulting from infrastructure bottlenecks. Some Canadian E&P customers have reacted to the lower prices by shutting in a portion of their natural gas production, negatively impacting their cash flows, capital spending and drilling activity.\n\ufeff\nSustained declines in commodity prices, or sustained periods of high differentials, would be expected to lead North American E&P companies to reduce drilling and completion activity, which could negatively impact our business.\n\ufeff\nListed and depicted below are recent crude oil and natural gas pricing trends, as provided by the Energy Information Administration (

After a period of declining drilling and completion activity from late 2014 through early 2016, North American E&P companies began to increase activity levels beginning in the second quarter of 2016, as evidenced by increasing rig counts in the U.S. and Canada. The rate of increase slowed in the U.S. starting in the third quarter of 2018 and the average rig count in Canada decreased in 2018 compared to 2017, with the average rig count in the fourth quarter of 2018 13% lower than the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\ufeff\nA substantial portion of our business is subject to quarterly variability. In Canada, we typically experience higher activity levels in the first quarter of each year, as our customers take advantage of the winter freeze to gain access to remote drilling and production areas. In the past, our revenue in Canada has declined during the second quarter due to warming weather conditions that result in thawing, softer ground, difficulty accessing drill sites and road bans that curtail drilling and completion activity. Access to well sites typically improves throughout the third and fourth quarters in Canada, leading to activity levels that are higher than in the second quarter, but lower than activity in the first quarter. Our business can also be impacted by a reduction in customer activity during the winter holidays in late December and early January. We anticipate that activity in Canada in the first quarter of 2019 will be significantly lower than in the first quarter of prior years due to low realized commodity prices resulting from high differentials and the production curtailments that are currently in place in Alberta.\n\ufeff\nThe industry experienced a reduction in completions activity in the United States in the second half of 2018, which has extended into early 2019. In addition, preliminary capital budgets from E&P companies indicate that capital spending in 2019 is expected to be below capital spending in 2018, with a number of customers indicating the intention to reduce the number of rigs and completion crews that they are operating.\n\ufeff\nThe market in Canada continues to be impacted by logistical constraints in moving oil and natural gas from areas of production activity to demand centers. These constraints have led to lower realized pricing for our Canadian customers, which have been partially offset by the initiatives implemented by the Province of Alberta. As a result, industry activity and capital spending in Canada in 2019 is currently forecasted to be materially below 2018 levels, both for producers of oil and liquids-rich natural gas and producers of natural gas. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the average land drilling rig count in Canada, as provided by Baker Hughes, was eight percent lower than during the same period in 2017. The average rig count in Canada for the first nine weeks of 2019 was 33% lower than in the same period in 2018. Commodity price differentials are forecasted to remain at higher-than-normal levels for an extended period of time, which we expect to have a negative impact on customer activity in 2019 and potentially beyond.\nAdoption of Pinpoint Stimulation\n\ufeff\nTraditional well completion techniques, including plug and perf and ball drop, currently account for the majority of unconventional well completions in North America. We believe that pinpoint stimulation provides substantial benefits compared to these traditional well completion techniques. Our ability to grow our market share, as evidenced by the percentage of horizontal wells in North America completed using our products and services, will depend in large part on the industry's further adoption of pinpoint stimulation to complete wells, our ability to continue to innovate our technology to compete against continuing technological advances in competing traditional well completions techniques, and our ability to successfully compete with other providers of pinpoint stimulation products and services, including adjusting our pricing in certain markets to respond to customer demands and to competitors that may provide discounted pricing to our customers.\n\ufeff\nIncreasing Well Complexity and Focus on Completion Optimization\n\ufeff\nIn recent years, E&P companies have drilled longer horizontal wells and completed more hydraulic fracturing stages per well to maximize the volume of hydrocarbon recoveries per well. This trend towards longer and more complex wells has resulted in us selling more sliding sleeves or composite frac plugs per well on average, which increases our revenue opportunity per well completion and has led to increased sales of our AirLock casing buoyancy systems. Additionally, E&P companies have become increasingly focused on well productivity through optimization of completion designs and we believe this trend may further the adoption of pinpoint stimulation, and in turn, increase the opportunity for sales of our products and services if our customers observe operational benefits and long-term production results from the application of pinpoint stimulation. This trend towards more complex well completions has also resulted in increased use of tracer diagnostics services, which can be utilized to assess the effectiveness of various well completion techniques and well spacing strategies in support of completion and field development optimization efforts.\n\ufeff\nAcquisitions\n\ufeff\nOn August 31, 2017, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Spectrum in exchange for approximately $83 million. Spectrum offers chemical and radioactive tracer diagnostics services that our customers utilize to better characterize their assets and to optimize completion designs. Chemical and radioactive tracer studies may provide a cost-effective and reliable means to determine the production profile along a lateral, assess fluid and proppant communication between wells during completions and determine stage and cluster level efficiency of completion designs. We believe Spectrum's tracer diagnostics services strengthens our ability to provide our customers with actionable data and analysis to optimize oil and natural gas well completions and field development strategies.\n\ufeff\nOn February 1, 2017, we acquired a 50% interest in Repeat Precision for $6.0 million. Repeat Precision has historically been a supplier to NCS. Our strategic purchase of 50% of this business ensures that we have continued access to their machining services and allows us greater control of the allocation of Repeat Precision's capacity, ensuring that we can scale their operations together with ours. In addition, Repeat Precision also markets certain completion products on a wholesale basis, providing an additional revenue opportunity.\nOn January 31, 2019, the cash payment of $10.0 million for the Repeat Precision earn-out consideration was paid to the joint venture partner. In connection with the Spectrum acquisition, we may need to pay the sellers additional consideration as part of an earn-out upon meeting certain specified targets. For additional information regarding our 2017 acquisitions, see Note 4. Acquisitions\u201d of our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nHow We Generate Revenues\n\ufeff\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from the sale of our fracturing systems products and the provision of related services. The remainder of our revenues are generated from sales of our AirLock casing buoyancy system, liner hanger systems, toe initiation sleeves and tracer diagnostics and reservoir strategies services. Repeat Precision generates revenue through the sale of composite frac plugs and related products and the provision of third-party manufacturing services.\n\ufeff\nProduct sales represented 69%, 72% and 74% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Most of our sales are on a just-in-time basis, as specified in individual purchase orders, with a fixed price for our products. We occasionally supply our customers with large orders that may be filled on negotiated terms. Services represented 31%, 28% and 26% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Services include our tool charges and associated services related to our fracturing systems and our tracer diagnostics services (which are classified together as services\u201d in our financial results). Services are provided at agreed rates we charge to our customers for the provision of our downhole frac isolation assembly, our personnel and for the provision of tracer diagnostics services.\n\ufeff\nDuring periods of low drilling and well completion activity or as may be needed to compete in certain markets we will, in certain instances, lower the prices of our products and services. Our revenues are also impacted by well complexity, with wells with more stages resulting in longer jobs and increased revenue attributable to selling more sliding sleeves or composite frac plugs and the provision of our services.\n\ufeff\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, approximately 48%, 63% and 71%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from sales in Canada and were denominated in Canadian dollars. Because our Canadian contracts are typically invoiced in Canadian dollars, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations impact our revenues and are regularly monitored.\n\ufeff\nAlthough most of our sales are to North American E&P companies, we do have sales to customers outside of North America and expect sales to international customers to increase over time. These international sales are made through local NCS entities or to our local operating partners on a free on board or free carrier basis with a point of sale in the United States. Some of the locations in which we have operating partners or sales representatives include China and the Middle East. Our operating partners and representatives do not have authority to contractually bind our company, but market our products in their respective territories as part of their product or service offering.\n\ufeff\nCosts of Conducting our Business\n\ufeff\nOur cost of sales is comprised of expenses relating to the manufacture of our products in addition to the costs of our support services. Manufacturing cost of sales includes payments made to our suppliers for raw materials and payments made to machine shops for the manufacturing of components used in our products and costs related to our employees that perform quality control analysis, assemble and test our products. During the first quarter of 2017, we acquired 50% of Repeat Precision, which has allowed us to reduce our costs for certain product categories. We review forecasted activity levels in our business and either directly procure or ensure that our vendors procure the required raw materials with sufficient lead time to meet our business requirements. On March 8, 2018, the President of the United States signed an order to impose a tariff of 25% on steel imported from certain countries. On July 1, 2018, Canada implemented retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. imports, including steel. While we and our suppliers have locked in pricing for\ncertain raw materials required to support some of our anticipated business activity during 2019, we anticipate that the tariff could result in an increase in our cost of sales during the year. On September 24, 2018, the United States implemented a tariff of 10% on significant number of commodities originating from China, including certain chemicals utilized in our tracer diagnostics business. The tariffs were scheduled to increase to 25% on January 1, 2019 but the increase has been delayed pending ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries. If a trade resolution with China is not reached, the increased tariffs would result in an increase in our cost of sales. We will strive to pass through some of the increases in raw material costs directly resulting from the tariffs to our customers, however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. Cost of sales for support services includes compensation and benefit-related expenses for employees who provide direct revenue generating services to customers in addition to the costs incurred by these employees for travel and subsistence while on site. Cost of sales includes other variable manufacturing costs, such as shrinkage, obsolescence and revaluation or scrap related to our existing inventory and costs related to the chemicals and laboratory analysis associated with our tracer diagnostics services.\n\ufeff\nOur selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses are comprised of compensation expense, which includes compensation and benefit-related expenses for our employees who are not directly involved in revenue generating activities, including those involved in our research and development activities, as well as our general operating costs. These general operating costs include, but are not limited to: rent and occupancy for our facilities, information technology infrastructure, software licensing, advertising and marketing, third party research and development, risk insurance and professional service fees for audit, legal and other consulting services. In 2015 and 2016, in response to decreased demand for our products and services resulting from the decline in E&P activity in our markets, we reduced our headcount and took certain other actions which resulted in restructuring charges, primarily severance expense. As a result of being a public company, our legal, accounting and other expenses have increased and will further increase for costs associated with our compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\ufeff\nThe percentage of our costs, defined as cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, and including SG&A, denominated in Canadian dollars for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, were approximately 21%, 32% and 36%, respectively.\n\ufeff\nHow We Evaluate our Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our results of operations and profitability and include:\n\ufeff\nRevenues\n\ufeff\nWe primarily sell our products and services under purchase orders with pricing negotiated on a one-off basis with each customer. Our revenues are generated primarily from the sales of our fracturing systems, well construction and composite plug products and from services related to the utilization of our downhole frac isolation assembly as well as from the provision of tracer diagnostics services. We compare our actual revenue performance on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis to our annual budget and to the most recent estimate we have for the relevant period and to applicable market metrics.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude certain items which we believe are not reflective of ongoing operating performance or which, in the case of impairments and share-based compensation, are non-cash in nature. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure that excludes costs that management believes do not reflect our ongoing operating performance and certain costs associated with our capital structure. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric that management uses to assess the period-to-period performance of our core business operations. We believe that presenting Adjusted EBITDA enables investors to assess our performance from period to period using the same metrics utilized by management and also allows investors to evaluate our performance relative to other companies that are not subject to such factors. Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), is not a measure of net income, income from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and is subject to important limitations. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\ufeff\nFree Cash Flow\n\ufeff\nWe utilize free cash flow to evaluate the cash generated by our operations and results of operations. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment (inclusive of the purchase and development of software and technology) plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment, as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Management believes free cash flow is useful because it provides information to investors regarding the cash that was available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures and other investment needs. Free cash\nflow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as we have non-discretionary expenditures, including, but not limited to, repayment of outstanding balances under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, that is not deducted in calculating free cash flow.\n\ufeff\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to cash provided by operating activities as a cash flow measurement.\n\ufeff\nResults of Operations\n\ufeff\nWe made acquisitions in the first quarter and third quarter of 2017. For additional information about these acquisitions, see Note 4. Acquisitions\u201d of our consolidated financial statements. Due to these acquisitions, our results of operations for the 2018 and 2017 periods presented may not be comparable to historical results of operations for the prior periods. The following table summarizes our revenues and expenses for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td>

compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\n\ufeff\nRevenues\n\ufeff\nRevenues were $227.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $201.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of sales of our well construction products as well as the contributions from Repeat Precision and tracer diagnostics services, both of which were added through acquisitions completed during 2017. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in fracturing systems product sales and services, especially in Canada. Product sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $156.8 million as compared to $144.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our service revenue was $70.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nCost of sales\n\ufeff\nCost of sales was $108.3 million, or 47.7% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $98.8 million, or 49.0% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cost of sales was primarily a result of higher cost of services due to increased services revenue resulting from the full year inclusion of tracer diagnostics services. Cost of sales was a lower percentage of revenues due to higher sales volumes for well construction products and at Repeat Precision, which enabled better utilization of fixed costs, partially offset by reduced fixed cost utilization related to a reduction in fracturing systems product sales and services, especially in Canada and higher cost of sales in tracer diagnostics, related to field service staffing levels and increased chemicals costs associated with tariffs imposed on certain imports from China in September 2018. Cost of product sales was $74.9 million or 47.8% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $33.4 million or 47.6% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, cost of product sales was $76.3 million or 52.7% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $22.5 million or 39.5% of service revenue.\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $82.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $64.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was the direct result of headcount additions in substantially all functional areas, twelve months of operations for tracer diagnostics services and Repeat Precision and an increase in share-based compensation related to the issuance of restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) and performance stock unit awards ( PSUs\u201d) during the first quarter of 2018 as well as amendments to certain stock options in connection with our IPO during the second quarter of 2017 that were to vest only in connection with a change of control (the Liquidity Options\u201d). The increases were partially offset by a reduction in our bonus accrual during the year ended December 31, 2018 and significant non-capitalizable additional expenses incurred related to our IPO of $2.3 million and acquisition costs of $1.0 million incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017, but not incurred in the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation\n\ufeff\nDepreciation was $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is attributable to a higher level of property and equipment, primarily related to our acquisitions in 2017 and capital expenditures made during 2018.\n\ufeff\nAmortization\n\ufeff\nAmortization was $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in amortization was related to intangible assets that became fully amortized during the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in amortizable intangible assets related to our acquisitions in 2017.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\n\ufeff\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration was $(2.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $5.5\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the revaluation of the earn-out obligations associated with our acquisitions. The fair value of contingent consideration reflects the impact of both actual results and forecasted future earnings, as well as the consideration of time from the current period to the payment date. As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the Spectrum earnout was $0.0 million, as no payment is currently expected, and the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the Repeat earnout was $10.0 million.\n\ufeff\nImpairments\n\ufeff\nDuring the fourth quarter, as a result of unfavorable oil and gas industry market conditions in late 2018 that have continued to persist into early 2019, and the related impact on expected customer activity levels, particularly in Canada, as well as a decline in the quoted price of our common stock, NCS recorded a total of $227.5 million of charges for the impairment of certain assets. These charges include:\n\ufeff\nTable 168: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA $6.9 million non-cash impairment of customer relationships related to our fracturing systems and well construction products and services\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA $66.6 million non-cash impairment of technology related to our fracturing systems and well construction products and services\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA $122.1 million non-cash impairment of goodwill related to our fracturing systems and well construction products and services\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA $31.9 million non-cash impairment of goodwill related to tracer diagnostics\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nSee Note 2.

The decrease in interest expense, net was primarily a result of prepaying our prior term loan in full in May 2017 by utilizing a portion of the proceeds from our IPO. The decrease was partially offset by higher interest expense due to borrowing $20.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility in August 2017.\n\ufeff\nOther income, net\n\ufeff\nOther income, net was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Other income, net was lower primarily due to the receipt of $0.9 million from an arbitration case that was decided in our favor in February 2017.\n\ufeff\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n\ufeff\nIncome tax benefit was $(23.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to an expense of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our effective income tax rates were 11.1% and 34.1%, respectively. The income tax benefit and effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was significantly impacted by the income tax rate change from 35% to 21% and the one time impairment charge which resulted in a corresponding decrease in the effective tax rate of 15.7%. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the income tax expense and effective tax rate differences included several offsetting items, including the effect of recording a tax expense for the enacted U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the 2017 Tax Act of $3.9 million, not providing U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because we intended to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. and a tax benefit for the reversal of our deferred tax liability due to the change in our foreign unremitted earnings assertion of $3.9 million. During the first quarter of 2017, we changed our assertion to state that undistributed foreign earnings are indefinitely or permanently reinvested as a result of cash proceeds received from the IPO during May 2017, a portion of which was used to pay off existing debt.\n\ufeff\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The ultimate impact of the 2017 Tax Act may differ from our estimates, possibly materially, due to changes in the interpretations and assumptions made as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the 2017 Tax Act.\n\ufeff\nThe 2017 Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of 2017, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. Our preliminary estimate of the 2017 Tax Act and the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities is subject to the finalization of management's analysis related to certain matters, such as developing interpretations of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, changes to certain estimates and the filing of our tax returns. U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting the 2017 Tax Act may require further adjustments and changes in our estimates. Those adjustments may impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.\n\ufeff\nFor our calendar year beginning in 2018 we are subject to several provisions of the 2017 Tax Act including computations under Global Intangible Low Taxed Income ( GILTI\u201d) and Foreign Derived Intangible Income ( FDII\u201d). We were able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of each provision of the 2017 Tax Act on our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\nOn a longer term basis, certain aspects of the 2017 Tax Act are expected to have a positive impact on our future income tax expense, including the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate.\n\ufeff\nAs a result of the geographic mix of earnings and losses, including discrete items, our tax rate has been and will continue to be volatile.\n\ufeff\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\n\ufeff\nRevenues\n\ufeff\nRevenues were $201.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $98.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in volume of sales of our completions products and services due to higher drilling and well completion activity in North America as a result of an improved commodity price environment in 2017 as compared to 2016 as well as the contribution of Repeat Precision and four months of revenue from Spectrum. Product sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $144.7 million as compared to $73.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our service revenue was $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\ufeff\nCost of sales\n\ufeff\nCost of sales was $98.8 million, or 49.0% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $53.8 million, or 54.7% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cost of sales was primarily a result of a higher number of wells completed and a higher volume of product sales as well as the effect of Repeat Precision and four months of cost of sales from Spectrum. Cost of sales were a lower percentage of revenues due to the higher volume of well completions and sliding sleeve and AirLock system sales, resulting in greater absorption of fixed costs. Cost of product sales was $76.3 million or 52.7% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $22.5 million or 39.5% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, cost of product sales was $40.5 million or 55.3% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $13.3 million or 52.7% of service revenue.\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $64.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was the direct result of headcount additions in substantially all functional areas. In addition, there were significant non-capitalizable additional expenses incurred related to our IPO of $2.3 million, subsequent costs related to operating as a public company, expenses related to the acquisitions, the effect of Repeat Precision and four months of operations from Spectrum and an increase in share-based compensation related to the issuance of RSUs and amendments to our Liquidity Options certain stock options that were to vest only in connection with a change of control as discussed in Note 12. Share-Based Compensation\u201d of our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation\n\ufeff\nDepreciation was $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is attributable to a higher level of property and equipment, primarily related to our acquisitions.\n\ufeff\nAmortization\n\ufeff\nAmortization was $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The majority of the increase in amortization was due to an increase in amortizable intangible assets related to our acquisitions and the increase in the average exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\n\ufeff\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration was $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the $5.5 million increase in the fair value of the earn-outs associated with our acquisitions. The fair value of contingent consideration reflects the impact of both actual results and forecasted future earnings, as well as the consideration of time from the current period to the payment date. As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the Spectrum earnout was $3.4 million and the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the Repeat earnout was $9.4 million.\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in interest expense, net was primarily a result of prepaying our prior credit agreement in full in May 2017 by utilizing a portion of the proceeds from our IPO. The decrease was partially offset by the write-off of the remaining loan fees of $1.4 million associated with the prepayment of the prior credit agreement and interest expense due to borrowing $20.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility in August 2017.\n\ufeff\nOther income, net\n\ufeff\nOther income, net was $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $45 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other income, net was higher primarily due to the receipt of $0.9 million from an arbitration case that was decided in our favor in February 2017.\n\ufeff\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss)\n\ufeff\nForeign currency exchange gain was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a loss of $(2.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily due to the impact of the retirement of our foreign currency denominated debt and changes in the foreign currency exchange rates between the periods.\n\ufeff\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n\ufeff\nIncome tax expense (benefit) was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a benefit of $(8.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our effective income tax rates were 34.1% and 33.0%, respectively. The primary differences between these effective tax rates were due to several offsetting items, including the effects of recording a tax expense for the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the 2017 Tax Act of $3.9 million, not providing U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. and a tax benefit for the reversal of our deferred tax liability due to the change in our foreign unremitted earnings assertion of $3.9 million. During the first quarter of 2017, we changed our assertion to state that undistributed foreign earnings are indefinitely or permanently reinvested as a result of cash proceeds received from the IPO during May 2017, a portion of which was used to pay off existing debt.\n\ufeff\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The ultimate impact of the 2017 Tax Act may differ from our estimates, possibly materially, due to changes in the interpretations and assumptions made as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the 2017 Tax Act.\n\ufeff\nThe 2017 Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of 2017, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. We have reasonably estimated the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and recorded amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a tax benefit of $0.5 million for the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% and recorded a mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries of $4.4 million.\n\ufeff\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\ufeff\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $25.1 million and availability under the Senior Secured Credit Facility of $55.0 million. Our total indebtedness was $25.7 million as of December 31, 2018. Our principal liquidity needs have been, and are expected to continue to be, capital expenditures, working capital, debt service and potential mergers and acquisitions.\n\ufeff\nWe plan to incur approximately $9 million to $13 million in capital expenditures during 2019, which includes capital expenditures related to (i) additional machining capacity at Repeat Precision, (ii) additional production equipment and instrumentation to support our tracer diagnostics services, (iii) machinery and equipment utilized in manufacturing and engineering and (iv) the remainder of the estimated spending for our research and development facility. Our capital expenditures, including the purchase and development of software and technology, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $15.8 million, $5.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Our 2018 capital expenditures included our investment in the research and development facility and an enterprise resource planning system. We believe our cash on hand, cash flows from operations and potential borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditure and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months.\n\ufeff\nWe anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity, it will be funded through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the proceeds of equity issuances, or a combination thereof. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain this additional liquidity on reasonable terms, or at all. Our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and fund our capital requirements are also dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial and other factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from\noperations or that funds will be available from additional indebtedness, the capital markets or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs. If we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions, we may incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance such acquisitions, which could result in additional expenses or dilution.\n\ufeff\nCash Flows and Free Cash Flow\n\ufeff\nThe following table provides a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented (in thousands):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>14,026 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>16,114 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>10,684 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(15,410) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(85,221) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,840) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(5,130) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>84,033 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(315) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(2,164) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>608 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>201 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(8,678) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>15,534 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>8,730 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFree cash flow (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(1,384) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>11,048 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>9,844 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\nTable 173: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment (inclusive of the purchase and development of software and technology) plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment. Management believes free cash flow is useful because it provides information to investors regarding the cash that was available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures and other investment needs. Free cash flow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as we have non-discretionary expenditures, including, but not limited to, repayment of outstanding balances under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, that are not deducted in calculating free cash flow.

The decrease in 2018 was primarily related to lower net income as a result of one-time impairment charges of $227.5 million and significantly higher cash taxes paid, partially offset by the addback of the non-cash impairment charges, a smaller increase in non-tax net working capital accounts in addition to increased business activity.\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $16.1 million and $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2017 was primarily related to higher net income and higher levels of non-cash expenses, including share-based compensation and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration. The increase was partially offset by changes in working capital including higher accounts receivable, inventories and income taxes payable and a decrease in accounts payable.\n\ufeff\nInvesting Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in investing activities was $15.4 million and $85.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily related to the $81.2 million funding of two acquisitions during 2017. See Note 4. Acquisitions\u201d in our consolidated financial statements. The decrease was partially offset by capital expenditures, including property, equipment, software and technology, of $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $5.4 million for the same period in 2017.\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in investing activities was $85.2 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the $81.2 million funding of two acquisitions. We also incurred an additional $4.2 million of capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 in comparison to the same period in 2016. The increase is primarily\nattributable to the growth of our business and capital expenditures for Repeat Precision and Spectrum. The increase was partially offset by a $1.0 million note receivable repayment during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nFinancing Activities\n\ufeff\nThe net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $(5.1) million as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $84.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change between net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily related to net proceeds from the completion of our IPO on May 3, 2017 of $148.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses, borrowings of $20.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility during the third quarter of 2017 and distributions of $2.3 million made to our joint venture partner during the third and fourth quarters of 2018. The decreases were partially offset by the $89.1 million repayment of the prior term loan under our prior credit agreement during the second quarter of 2017.\n\ufeff\nThe net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $84.0 million as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $(0.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to net proceeds of $148.9 million from our IPO after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. Additionally, we borrowed $20.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. The increases were partially offset by $89.1 million of note repayments of the prior credit agreement.\n\ufeff\nFinancing Arrangement\n\ufeff\nOn May 4, 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Pioneer Investment, Inc., as borrower (the U.S. Borrower\u201d), NCS Multistage Inc., as borrower (the Canadian Borrower\u201d), Pioneer Intermediate, Inc. (together with the Company, the Parent Guarantors\u201d) and the lenders party thereto, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as administrative agent in respect of the U.S. Facility (as defined below) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Canadian Branch as administrative agent in respect of the Canadian Facility (as defined below) (the senior secured revolving credit facilities provided thereunder, the Senior Secured Credit Facility\u201d). The Credit Agreement amended and restated the prior credit agreement in its entirety. The Senior Secured Credit Facility will mature on May 4, 2020.\n\ufeff\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facility originally consisted of a (i) senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million made available to the U.S. Borrower (the U.S. Facility\u201d), of which up to $5.0 million may be made available for letters of credit and up to $5.0 million may be made available for swingline loans and (ii) senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million made available to the Canadian Borrower (the Canadian Facility\u201d).\n\ufeff\nWe entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement on August 31, 2017, which increased the loan commitment available to the U.S. Borrower to $50.0 million from $25.0 million under the U.S. Facility. The loan commitment available under the Canadian Facility remained at $25.0 million. On February 16, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement and, on October 9, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement, each of which amended certain negative covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2018, we had $20.0 million in outstanding indebtedness under the U.S. Facility and no outstanding indebtedness under the Canadian Facility.\n\ufeff\nBorrowings under the U.S. Facility may be made in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars or Euros and bear interest at a rate equal to the Adjusted Base Rate or Eurocurrency Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), in each case, plus an applicable interest margin as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Canadian Facility may be made in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars and bear interest at the Canadian (Cdn) Base Rate, Canadian (U.S.) Base Rate, Eurocurrency Rate or Discount Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), in each case, plus an applicable interest margin as set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Adjusted Base Rate, Canadian (U.S.) Base Rate and Canadian (Cdn) Base Rate applicable margin will be between 2.25% and 3.00% and Eurocurrency Rate applicable margin will be between 3.25% and 4.00%, in each case, depending on the Company's leverage ratio. The applicable interest rate at December 31, 2018 was 5.88%.\n\ufeff\nThe obligations of the U.S. Borrower under the U.S. Facility are guaranteed by the Parent Guarantors and each of the other existing and future direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries of the Company organized under the laws of the United States (subject to certain exceptions) and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Parent Guarantors, the U.S. Borrower and such other subsidiary guarantors, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens. The obligations of the Canadian Borrower under the Canadian Facility are guaranteed by the Parent Guarantors, the U.S. Borrower and each of the future direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries of the Company organized under the laws of the United States and Canada (subject to certain exceptions) and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Parent Guarantors, the U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower and such subsidiary guarantors, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens.\n\ufeff\nThe Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require (i) commencing with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017, compliance with a leverage ratio test set at (A) 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending prior to March 31, 2018 and (B) 2.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending on or after March 31, 2018, (ii) commencing with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017, compliance with an interest coverage ratio test set at 2.75 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, (iii) if the leverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter is greater than 2.00 to 1.00 and the amount outstanding under the Canadian Facility at any time during such fiscal quarter was greater than $0, compliance as of the end of such fiscal quarter with a Canadian asset coverage ratio test set at 1.00 to 1.00 and (iv) if the leverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter is greater than 2.00 to 1.00 and the amount outstanding under the U.S. Facility at any time during such fiscal quarter was greater than $0, compliance as of the end of such fiscal quarter with a U.S. asset coverage ratio test set at 1.00 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. The Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on the creation of liens, the incurrence of indebtedness, investments, dividends and other restricted payments, dispositions and transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default for facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable). If an event of default occurs, the lenders under each of the U.S. Facility and the Canadian Facility may elect (after the expiration of any applicable notice or grace periods) to declare all outstanding borrowings under such facility, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under each of the U.S. Facility and the Canadian Facility also have the right upon an event of default thereunder to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings under such facility. Further, following an event of default under each of the U.S. Facility and the Canadian Facility, the lenders thereunder will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such facility.\n\ufeff\nContractual Obligations\n\ufeff\nThe following table presents our contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3- 5 years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital lease obligations including interest payments\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,625 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,768 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,659 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>198 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSenior Secured Credit Facility and other debt\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>22,412 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>666 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>21,746 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,767 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,301 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>466 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEarn-outs for the acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9,963 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9,963 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax payable related to the 2017 Tax Act (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>456 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>43 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>87 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>190 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>136 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEquipment and office operating leases\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6,024 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,867 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,033 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>726 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>398 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>44,247 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>16,608 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>25,991 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,114 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>534 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\nTable 176: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe 2017 Tax Act includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result, all previously unremitted earnings for which no U.S. deferred tax liability had been accrued have now been subject to U.S. tax.

However, if our costs become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to offset such increased costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to offset any such cost increases in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\ufeff\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. The accounting policies that we believe to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and that require the most complex and subjective management judgments are discussed below.\n\ufeff\nRevenue Recognition\n\ufeff\nWe derive our revenues primarily from highly engineered products and support services. Revenues are based upon a purchase order, contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer that includes a fixed or determinable price, provided that collectability is reasonably assured, but such arrangements do not generally include right of return or other similar provisions or other significant post-delivery obligations. Sales and value added taxes that we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (i) identify the contract, (ii) identify the performance obligations, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price and (v) satisfy the performance obligation. No single customer individually accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue during the year ended 2018. One customer accounted for 12% of our trade receivable accounts balance as of December 31, 2018, with the majority of the balance collected in January 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized revenue from our largest customer totaling $27.4 million, or 14% of total revenue for the year. Amounts due from this customer included in trade accounts receivable was $2.0 million, or 4% of trade accounts receivable, as of December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the same customer accounted for $25.5 million, or approximately 26% of total revenue, and as of December 31, 2016, $7.8 million in trade accounts receivable were due from this customer, or 24% of trade accounts receivable. No other customer individually accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue during 2017 and 2016 or trade receivable accounts balance as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\n\ufeff\nOn occasion, we issue credits to our customers that are related specifically to the performance of our products or the services we provide, with such credits reducing the amount of revenue for that sale or job. Such credits are infrequent, situation-specific and cannot be estimated in advance.\n\ufeff\nThe payment terms and conditions in our customer contracts vary. We do not have contracts that contain a financing component and do not accept noncash consideration from customers.\n\ufeff\nNCS has elected to recognize shipping and handling costs when the control of the product transfers to the customer. These costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\ufeff\nProduct Sales Revenues\n\ufeff\nFor product sale arrangements that are standard inventory products or modified inventory products with an alternative use, revenue is recognized at a point in time when control transfers. Control generally transfers upon shipment or delivery, and delivery is based on the customer instructions. Customers may also request bill and hold arrangements in writing. Once we have completed the bill and hold order, the products are segregated from the rest of inventory in the warehouse. The transaction price for product sales having a performance obligation is the price per unit times the unit quantity ordered and shipped to the customer or consumed at the well site.\n\ufeff\nServices Revenue\n\ufeff\nFor service arrangements that do not have a contract provision with a right to a payment for services up to the date of termination, revenue is recognized when the job has been completed, which usually includes a customer signature or acknowledgement and when there are no additional services or future obligations required by us. The transaction price is determined by the contract unit day rate times the cumulative number of days of service provided upon the completion of the service and upon customer acceptance.\n\ufeff\nFor service arrangements that do have a contract provision with a right to payment for services up to the date of termination, revenue is recognized over time using a unit rate (labor and materials) output method that corresponds to the value we would receive upon termination of the contract at a reporting period. In applying the output method at the end of a quarter, we check that there is no material work in progress that is not in the measurement of the output. The transaction price for the period end is determined by the contract unit rate times the cumulative number of units earned up to the reporting period less any revenue recognized in prior periods.\n\ufeff\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\ufeff\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Earnings are charged with a provision for doubtful accounts based on a current review of the collectability of customer accounts by management. Such allowances are based upon several factors including, but not limited to, credit approval practices, industry and customer historical experience as well as the current and projected financial condition of the specific customer. Accounts deemed uncollectible are applied against the allowance for doubtful accounts. We have recorded $0.3 million and $11 thousand in provisions for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\ufeff\nInventories\n\ufeff\nInventories consist primarily of raw material, sliding sleeve components, assembled sliding sleeves, certain components used to internally construct our frac isolation assemblies, assembled well construction products and components, composite plugs and components and chemicals, in raw material or finished goods, used for frac diagnostics testing and reporting. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost is determined at standard costs approximating the first-in first-out basis with the exception of chemical costs, which are determined using average costing. We continuously evaluate inventories, based on an analysis of inventory levels, historical sales experience and future sales forecasts, to determine obsolete, slow-moving and excess inventory. Adjustments to reduce such inventory to its estimated recoverable value have been recorded by management as an adjustment to cost of sales.\n\ufeff\nImpairments\n\ufeff\nWe evaluate our property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability based on undiscounted future net cash flows. Should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value. Estimating future net cash flows requires us to make judgements regarding long-term forecasts of future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. These forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about our revenue growth, operating margins, capital expenditures, future market conditions and technological developments. If changes in these assumptions occur, our expectations regarding future net cash flows may change such that a material impairment could result. As a result of unfavorable oil and gas industry market conditions in late 2018 that have continued to persist into early 2019 and the related impact on expected customer activity levels, particularly in Canada, as well as a decline in the quoted price of our common stock, we determined that the carrying values of certain long-lived assets in one of our asset groups were no longer recoverable, which resulted in an impairment charge of $73.5 million related to identifiable intangible assets, which we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. There was no impairment related to fixed assets in 2018. No fixed asset or finite-lived intangible impairments were recorded in 2017 or 2016. See Note 7. Goodwill and Intangibles\u201d of our consolidated financial statements for additional detail related to these charges.\n\ufeff\nAn assessment for goodwill impairment is performed annually or when there is an indication an impairment may have occurred. We typically complete our annual impairment test for goodwill using an assessment date in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets (including allocated goodwill) to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a combination of a market multiple and a discounted cash flow approach. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of estimates, assumptions and judgement. The principal estimates and assumptions that we use include revenue growth, operating margins, capital expenditures, future market conditions, weighted average costs of capital, a terminal growth rate, the set of comparable companies utilized, and the earnings metrics and multiples utilized. We believe that the estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments are reasonable. If the reporting unit's carrying value is greater than its calculated fair value, we recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its calculated fair value. At December 31, 2018, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test on each of our three reporting units and as a result of unfavorable oil and gas industry market conditions in late 2018 that have continued to persist into early 2019 and the related impact on expected customer activity levels, particularly in Canada, as well as a decline in the quoted price of our common stock, we concluded that there had been an impairment because the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair values for two reporting units, which resulted in an impairment charge of $154.0 million. No impairments were recorded in 2017 or 2016. See Note 7. Goodwill and Intangibles\u201d of our consolidated financial statements for additional detail related to these charges.\n\ufeff\nProperty and Equipment\n\ufeff\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Equipment held under capital leases are stated at the present value of minimum lease payments. Expenditures for property and equipment and for items which substantially increase the useful lives of existing assets are capitalized at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful life utilizing the straight-line method. Routine expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements and property under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the remaining lease term or useful life of the related asset. Depreciation expense includes amortization of assets under capital leases. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are recognized in other (expense) income, net in the year of disposal.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation on property and equipment, including assets held under capital leases, is calculated using the straight-line method over the following useful service lives or lease term (which includes reasonably assured renewal periods):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBuildings\n</td> <td>30 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBuilding equipment\n</td> <td>5 - 15 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMachinery and equipment\n</td> <td>5 - 12 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFurniture and fixtures\n</td> <td>3 - 5 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nComputers and software\n</td> <td>3 - 5 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVehicles and rental equipment\n</td> <td>3 - 4 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLeasehold improvements\n</td> <td>\nLease term (1-5)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\ufeff\nBusiness combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 805, Business Combinations. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total consideration transferred in connection with the acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree based on their fair values. Goodwill acquired in connection with business combinations represents the excess of consideration transferred over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Certain assumptions and estimates are employed in evaluating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These estimates may be affected by factors such as changing market conditions, technological advances in the oil and natural gas industry or changes in regulations governing that industry. The most significant assumptions requiring judgment involve identifying and estimating the fair value of intangible assets and the associated useful lives for establishing amortization periods. To finalize purchase accounting for significant acquisitions, we utilize the services of independent valuation specialists to assist in the determination of the fair value of acquired intangible assets.\n\ufeff\nCosts related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issuance of debt or equity securities, that we incur in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.\n\ufeff\nAny contingent consideration payable is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Liability-classified contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until the contingent consideration is settled.\n\ufeff\nAll identifiable intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life or term of related agreements. Deferred loan costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method. Certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software applications are capitalized and costs incurred outside of the software application development stage are expensed as incurred. The amounts capitalized are included in intangibles, categorized as internally developed software, and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software when it is ready for its intended use. These assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes\n\ufeff\nWe are taxed as a corporation as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. The liability method is used in accounting for deferred income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. The realizability of deferred tax assets is evaluated annually and a valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not give rise to future benefits. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, based upon technical merits, upon examination by the taxing authorities. If the income tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria, the benefit recorded in the consolidated financial statements equals the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon its ultimate settlement. A valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the valuation allowance was $1.1 million and $18 thousand, respectively. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in other income (expense). During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in interest and penalties. We had $0.6 million and $0.6 million in interest and penalties accrued at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\ufeff\nOne of our Canadian subsidiaries guaranteed the credit facilities of our U.S. entities until May 2017 when cash proceeds were received from the IPO, a portion of which was used to pay off the existing debt. Under U.S. federal income tax rules, this guarantee resulted in all of the earnings and profits of our Canadian subsidiary being subject to current U.S. tax. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act and a change in our permanent earnings reinvestment assertion, we have recognized a U.S. tax benefit for the reversal of our deferred\ntax liability on a portion of our differences between book value and tax basis in our Canadian subsidiary for which we are now asserting indefinite reinvestment. No U.S. deferred tax liabilities have been recognized on the differences between book value and tax basis that we continue to indefinitely reinvest. Upon reversal of these book value and tax basis differences through dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to foreign withholding taxes. It is not practical, however, to estimate the amount of taxes that may be payable on the eventual remittance of these temporary differences after consideration of available foreign tax credits.\n\ufeff\nWe completed our analysis of our tax positions and believe there are no material uncertain tax positions that would require derecognition in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. We believe that there are no tax positions taken or expected to be taken that would significantly increase or decrease unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months following the balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no material amounts that had been accrued with respect to uncertain tax positions.\n\ufeff\nNo valuation allowances have been provided for the $9.3 million U.S. deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2018. The Company believes it is more likely than not to realize the benefit of this asset. The Company has historically been a U.S. taxpayer and projects future operations will generate sufficient taxable income. However, in the event the Company has a change in circumstances which would change management's judgment regarding the ability to generate sufficient U.S. taxable income, a valuation allowance would be recorded against the U.S. deferred tax asset.\n\ufeff\nWe file income tax returns in the United States, Canada and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Our U.S. income tax returns for 2011 and subsequent years remain open for examination. The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) commenced an examination of our United States income tax returns for 2011 through 2012 in the first quarter of 2014 which was completed in 2015. No tax adjustments were proposed. Additionally, subsequent to December 31, 2015, the IRS commenced an examination of our United States income tax return for 2014 in the second quarter of 2016, which was completed in 2017. No tax adjustments were proposed. During 2018, the Canada Revenue Agency ( CRA\u201d) commenced an examination of our transfer pricing on Canadian income tax returns for the 2012 through 2015 filings and no tax adjustments have been proposed.\n\ufeff\nShare-Based Compensation\n\ufeff\nWe account for our stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation- Stock Compensation ( ASC 718\u201d). We recognize compensation cost for all share-based payment transactions, including compensation cost associated with the grant of options, RSUs and PSUs for our common stock using the Black-Scholes model for options, the market price of the common stock on the date of the grant for the RSUs and a Monte Carlo simulation for the PSUs. Expense is recognized ratably from one to five years based upon the requisite service period. We also have an ESPP, which allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of the stock price at the beginning or end of the offering period. The fair value of the employees' purchase rights under the ESPP is estimated using the Black-Scholes model. For additional information, see Note 12. Share-Based Compensation\u201d of our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\ufeff\nSee Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of the accounting pronouncements we recently adopted and the accounting pronouncements recently issued by the FASB.\n\ufeff\nEmerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status\n\ufeff\nWe are an emerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act\u201d). We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of our fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. Additionally, we are also a smaller reporting company\u201d as defined by Section 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act\u201d), meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $250 million. As an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, we may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies that do not qualify for those classifications.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as of, and for, the periods presented. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the sections entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d -Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Item 6. Selected Historical Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This section and other parts of the Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements regarding the industry outlook, estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial and industry trends that may affect our future results of operations or financial condition and other non-historical statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties described in -Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\n\ufeff\nOverview and Outlook\n\ufeff\nWe are a leading provider of highly engineered products and support services that facilitate the optimization of oil and natural gas well completions and field development strategies. We provide our products and services primarily to E&P companies for use in onshore wells, predominantly wells that have been drilled with horizontal laterals in unconventional oil and natural gas formations. Our products and services are utilized in oil and natural gas basins throughout North America and in selected international markets, including Argentina, China, Russia and the North Sea. We provided our products and services to over 310 customers in 2018, including leading large independent oil and natural gas companies and major oil companies.\n\ufeff\nOur primary offering is our fracturing systems products and services, which enable efficient pinpoint stimulation: the process of individually stimulating each entry point into a formation targeted by an oil or natural gas well. Our fracturing systems products and services are typically utilized in cemented wellbores and enable our customers to precisely place stimulation treatments in a more controlled and repeatable manner as compared with traditional completion techniques. Our fracturing systems products and services are utilized in conjunction with third-party providers of pressure pumping, coiled tubing and other services.\n\ufeff\nWe sell products for well construction, including our AirLock casing buoyancy system, liner hanger systems and toe initiation sleeves. We provide tracer diagnostics services for well completion and reservoir characterization that utilize downhole chemical and radioactive tracers and consult on reservoir strategies by providing engineering services. Repeat Precision sells composite frac plugs and related products and provides third-party manufacturing services. We operate in one reportable segment.\n\ufeff\nBased on recent commodity prices and preliminary budgets set by E&P companies, we believe that industry drilling and completions activity in North America will be lower in 2019 than it was in 2018. Many of our customers in North America have begun to prioritize free cash flow and the return of capital to shareholders over production growth, which is leading to lower levels of capital expenditures. This is due in part to relatively low commodity prices at the time our customers established their budgets and also concerns over global demand for oil and natural gas based on macroeconomic conditions. We expect customer activity in the U.S. to decline slightly on a year-over-year basis, with activity levels declining in early 2019 from year-end 2018 levels, with the possibility for activity to improve over the course of the year. We believe that customer activity in Canada could be significantly below levels seen in prior years, especially in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter in prior years. This is due to the factors mentioned above and also due to elevated commodity price differentials and mandatory production curtailments imposed on certain operators in Alberta. Market conditions in Canada have resulted in continued customer and competitor-driven pricing pressure for our products and services, negatively impacting our margins and market share in certain markets. We currently expect international activity to increase slightly in 2019 as market conditions remain more constructive than in North America.\n\ufeff\nMarket Conditions\n\ufeff\nOil and Natural Gas Drilling and Completion Activity\n\ufeff\nOur products and services are primarily sold to North American E&P companies and our ability to generate revenues from our products and services depends upon oil and natural gas drilling and production activity in North America. Oil and natural gas drilling and production activity is directly related to oil and natural gas prices.\n\ufeff\nOil and natural gas prices remain volatile, with WTI crude oil pricing falling to a low of approximately $26 per barrel in February 2016 before recovering to approximately $60 per barrel by the end of December 2017 and then falling again to approximately $45 per barrel by the end of December 2018. Crude oil pricing has been supported by voluntary oil production reductions by members of OPEC, and certain other countries, including Russia. These supply reductions were announced in November 2016 and were initially implemented in 2017. In November 2017, OPEC and certain other countries, including Russia, announced their intent to extend the supply reductions through the end of 2018. These countries had reduced their supply by more than the targeted amounts through early 2018, reaching 152% of targeted supply reductions in May 2018. In June 2018, OPEC and certain\nother countries, including Russia, announced that they would strive to conform with the supply reductions at a 100% level as of July 1, 2018, signaling an increase in production from prior levels. In response to falling crude oil prices in late 2018, OPEC and certain other countries, including Russia, agreed to a new round of supply reductions in December 2018, which were intended to be effective as of January 2019. There can be no assurance that the countries involved will continue to comply with the intended reductions and the amount of oil supply that may be returned to the market if the supply reductions are not extended further is unknown.\n\ufeff\nOn August 6, 2018, the United States announced its intent to impose economic sanctions on Iran, following the United States' withdrawal from an international accord intended to limit Iran's nuclear programs. The sanctions, including secondary sanctions targeting companies that do business with Iran, are expected to reduce Iran's level of crude oil exports and went into effect in early November. However, the United States granted temporary waivers to eight countries that import oil from Iran. Other oil exporting countries, including Saudi Arabia and Russia have committed to increase oil supplies to offset any shortfall related to a reduction in Iranian oil exports. There can be no assurance in the level of reduction of Iranian crude exports, the expiration of the temporary waivers or of the ability of other countries to readily supply crude oil to the market if Iranian crude exports decline materially.\n\ufeff\nOver the course of 2018, there was an increase in the difference between the benchmark crude oil pricing in certain markets and WTI, known in the industry as differentials. Crude oil in certain areas, including West Texas, North Dakota and Canada have traded at a larger discount to WTI than in historical periods due to current and forecasted production levels that are in excess of local refining demand and pipeline capacity. In response to these price differentials, many E&P companies operating in these areas reduced their drilling and completion activity in the second half of 2018 and into 2019 or chose to delay completions until additional pipeline or rail capacity is placed into service. In Canada, the Province of Alberta implemented a number of measures intended to reduce the differential in the region, including supporting the purchase of railcars to be utilized to transport oil out of the province and by implementing mandatory production curtailments for companies producing more than 10,000 barrels per day in the province.\n\ufeff\nNatural gas pricing reached a low of approximately $1.50 per MMBtu in March 2016 before recovering to an average level of approximately $3.15 per MMBtu during 2018. Realized natural gas prices for Canadian E&P customers are typically at a discount to U.S. Henry Hub pricing. Spot pricing for Canadian natural gas at the AECO hub has been volatile since mid-2017, with wider-than-normal discounts to Henry Hub pricing resulting from infrastructure bottlenecks. Some Canadian E&P customers have reacted to the lower prices by shutting in a portion of their natural gas production, negatively impacting their cash flows, capital spending and drilling activity.\n\ufeff\nSustained declines in commodity prices, or sustained periods of high differentials, would be expected to lead North American E&P companies to reduce drilling and completion activity, which could negatively impact our business.\n\ufeff\nListed and depicted below are recent crude oil and natural gas pricing trends, as provided by the Energy Information Administration ( EIA\u201d) of the U.S. Department of Energy:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

After a period of declining drilling and completion activity from late 2014 through early 2016, North American E&P companies began to increase activity levels beginning in the second quarter of 2016, as evidenced by increasing rig counts in the U.S. and Canada. The rate of increase slowed in the U.S. starting in the third quarter of 2018 and the average rig count in Canada decreased in 2018 compared to 2017, with the average rig count in the fourth quarter of 2018 13% lower than the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\ufeff\nA substantial portion of our business is subject to quarterly variability. In Canada, we typically experience higher activity levels in the first quarter of each year, as our customers take advantage of the winter freeze to gain access to remote drilling and production areas. In the past, our revenue in Canada has declined during the second quarter due to warming weather conditions that result in thawing, softer ground, difficulty accessing drill sites and road bans that curtail drilling and completion activity. Access to well sites typically improves throughout the third and fourth quarters in Canada, leading to activity levels that are higher than in the second quarter, but lower than activity in the first quarter. Our business can also be impacted by a reduction in customer activity during the winter holidays in late December and early January. We anticipate that activity in Canada in the first quarter of 2019 will be significantly lower than in the first quarter of prior years due to low realized commodity prices resulting from high differentials and the production curtailments that are currently in place in Alberta.\n\ufeff\nThe industry experienced a reduction in completions activity in the United States in the second half of 2018, which has extended into early 2019. In addition, preliminary capital budgets from E&P companies indicate that capital spending in 2019 is expected to be below capital spending in 2018, with a number of customers indicating the intention to reduce the number of rigs and completion crews that they are operating.\n\ufeff\nThe market in Canada continues to be impacted by logistical constraints in moving oil and natural gas from areas of production activity to demand centers. These constraints have led to lower realized pricing for our Canadian customers, which have been partially offset by the initiatives implemented by the Province of Alberta. As a result, industry activity and capital spending in Canada in 2019 is currently forecasted to be materially below 2018 levels, both for producers of oil and liquids-rich natural gas and producers of natural gas. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the average land drilling rig count in Canada, as provided by Baker Hughes, was eight percent lower than during the same period in 2017. The average rig count in Canada for the first nine weeks of 2019 was 33% lower than in the same period in 2018. Commodity price differentials are forecasted to remain at higher-than-normal levels for an extended period of time, which we expect to have a negative impact on customer activity in 2019 and potentially beyond.\nAdoption of Pinpoint Stimulation\n\ufeff\nTraditional well completion techniques, including plug and perf and ball drop, currently account for the majority of unconventional well completions in North America. We believe that pinpoint stimulation provides substantial benefits compared to these traditional well completion techniques. Our ability to grow our market share, as evidenced by the percentage of horizontal wells in North America completed using our products and services, will depend in large part on the industry's further adoption of pinpoint stimulation to complete wells, our ability to continue to innovate our technology to compete against continuing technological advances in competing traditional well completions techniques, and our ability to successfully compete with other providers of pinpoint stimulation products and services, including adjusting our pricing in certain markets to respond to customer demands and to competitors that may provide discounted pricing to our customers.\n\ufeff\nIncreasing Well Complexity and Focus on Completion Optimization\n\ufeff\nIn recent years, E&P companies have drilled longer horizontal wells and completed more hydraulic fracturing stages per well to maximize the volume of hydrocarbon recoveries per well. This trend towards longer and more complex wells has resulted in us selling more sliding sleeves or composite frac plugs per well on average, which increases our revenue opportunity per well completion and has led to increased sales of our AirLock casing buoyancy systems. Additionally, E&P companies have become increasingly focused on well productivity through optimization of completion designs and we believe this trend may further the adoption of pinpoint stimulation, and in turn, increase the opportunity for sales of our products and services if our customers observe operational benefits and long-term production results from the application of pinpoint stimulation. This trend towards more complex well completions has also resulted in increased use of tracer diagnostics services, which can be utilized to assess the effectiveness of various well completion techniques and well spacing strategies in support of completion and field development optimization efforts.\n\ufeff\nAcquisitions\n\ufeff\nOn August 31, 2017, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Spectrum in exchange for approximately $83 million. Spectrum offers chemical and radioactive tracer diagnostics services that our customers utilize to better characterize their assets and to optimize completion designs. Chemical and radioactive tracer studies may provide a cost-effective and reliable means to determine the production profile along a lateral, assess fluid and proppant communication between wells during completions and determine stage and cluster level efficiency of completion designs. We believe Spectrum's tracer diagnostics services strengthens our ability to provide our customers with actionable data and analysis to optimize oil and natural gas well completions and field development strategies.\n\ufeff\nOn February 1, 2017, we acquired a 50% interest in Repeat Precision for $6.0 million. Repeat Precision has historically been a supplier to NCS. Our strategic purchase of 50% of this business ensures that we have continued access to their machining services and allows us greater control of the allocation of Repeat Precision's capacity, ensuring that we can scale their operations together with ours. In addition, Repeat Precision also markets certain completion products on a wholesale basis, providing an additional revenue opportunity.\nOn January 31, 2019, the cash payment of $10.0 million for the Repeat Precision earn-out consideration was paid to the joint venture partner. In connection with the Spectrum acquisition, we may need to pay the sellers additional consideration as part of an earn-out upon meeting certain specified targets. For additional information regarding our 2017 acquisitions, see Note 4. Acquisitions\u201d of our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nHow We Generate Revenues\n\ufeff\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from the sale of our fracturing systems products and the provision of related services. The remainder of our revenues are generated from sales of our AirLock casing buoyancy system, liner hanger systems, toe initiation sleeves and tracer diagnostics and reservoir strategies services. Repeat Precision generates revenue through the sale of composite frac plugs and related products and the provision of third-party manufacturing services.\n\ufeff\nProduct sales represented 69%, 72% and 74% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Most of our sales are on a just-in-time basis, as specified in individual purchase orders, with a fixed price for our products. We occasionally supply our customers with large orders that may be filled on negotiated terms. Services represented 31%, 28% and 26% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Services include our tool charges and associated services related to our fracturing systems and our tracer diagnostics services (which are classified together as services\u201d in our financial results). Services are provided at agreed rates we charge to our customers for the provision of our downhole frac isolation assembly, our personnel and for the provision of tracer diagnostics services.\n\ufeff\nDuring periods of low drilling and well completion activity or as may be needed to compete in certain markets we will, in certain instances, lower the prices of our products and services. Our revenues are also impacted by well complexity, with wells with more stages resulting in longer jobs and increased revenue attributable to selling more sliding sleeves or composite frac plugs and the provision of our services.\n\ufeff\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, approximately 48%, 63% and 71%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from sales in Canada and were denominated in Canadian dollars. Because our Canadian contracts are typically invoiced in Canadian dollars, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations impact our revenues and are regularly monitored.\n\ufeff\nAlthough most of our sales are to North American E&P companies, we do have sales to customers outside of North America and expect sales to international customers to increase over time. These international sales are made through local NCS entities or to our local operating partners on a free on board or free carrier basis with a point of sale in the United States. Some of the locations in which we have operating partners or sales representatives include China and the Middle East. Our operating partners and representatives do not have authority to contractually bind our company, but market our products in their respective territories as part of their product or service offering.\n\ufeff\nCosts of Conducting our Business\n\ufeff\nOur cost of sales is comprised of expenses relating to the manufacture of our products in addition to the costs of our support services. Manufacturing cost of sales includes payments made to our suppliers for raw materials and payments made to machine shops for the manufacturing of components used in our products and costs related to our employees that perform quality control analysis, assemble and test our products. During the first quarter of 2017, we acquired 50% of Repeat Precision, which has allowed us to reduce our costs for certain product categories. We review forecasted activity levels in our business and either directly procure or ensure that our vendors procure the required raw materials with sufficient lead time to meet our business requirements. On March 8, 2018, the President of the United States signed an order to impose a tariff of 25% on steel imported from certain countries. On July 1, 2018, Canada implemented retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. imports, including steel. While we and our suppliers have locked in pricing for\ncertain raw materials required to support some of our anticipated business activity during 2019, we anticipate that the tariff could result in an increase in our cost of sales during the year. On September 24, 2018, the United States implemented a tariff of 10% on significant number of commodities originating from China, including certain chemicals utilized in our tracer diagnostics business. The tariffs were scheduled to increase to 25% on January 1, 2019 but the increase has been delayed pending ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries. If a trade resolution with China is not reached, the increased tariffs would result in an increase in our cost of sales. We will strive to pass through some of the increases in raw material costs directly resulting from the tariffs to our customers, however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. Cost of sales for support services includes compensation and benefit-related expenses for employees who provide direct revenue generating services to customers in addition to the costs incurred by these employees for travel and subsistence while on site. Cost of sales includes other variable manufacturing costs, such as shrinkage, obsolescence and revaluation or scrap related to our existing inventory and costs related to the chemicals and laboratory analysis associated with our tracer diagnostics services.\n\ufeff\nOur selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses are comprised of compensation expense, which includes compensation and benefit-related expenses for our employees who are not directly involved in revenue generating activities, including those involved in our research and development activities, as well as our general operating costs. These general operating costs include, but are not limited to: rent and occupancy for our facilities, information technology infrastructure, software licensing, advertising and marketing, third party research and development, risk insurance and professional service fees for audit, legal and other consulting services. In 2015 and 2016, in response to decreased demand for our products and services resulting from the decline in E&P activity in our markets, we reduced our headcount and took certain other actions which resulted in restructuring charges, primarily severance expense. As a result of being a public company, our legal, accounting and other expenses have increased and will further increase for costs associated with our compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\ufeff\nThe percentage of our costs, defined as cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, and including SG&A, denominated in Canadian dollars for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, were approximately 21%, 32% and 36%, respectively.\n\ufeff\nHow We Evaluate our Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our results of operations and profitability and include:\n\ufeff\nRevenues\n\ufeff\nWe primarily sell our products and services under purchase orders with pricing negotiated on a one-off basis with each customer. Our revenues are generated primarily from the sales of our fracturing systems, well construction and composite plug products and from services related to the utilization of our downhole frac isolation assembly as well as from the provision of tracer diagnostics services. We compare our actual revenue performance on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis to our annual budget and to the most recent estimate we have for the relevant period and to applicable market metrics.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude certain items which we believe are not reflective of ongoing operating performance or which, in the case of impairments and share-based compensation, are non-cash in nature. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure that excludes costs that management believes do not reflect our ongoing operating performance and certain costs associated with our capital structure. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric that management uses to assess the period-to-period performance of our core business operations. We believe that presenting Adjusted EBITDA enables investors to assess our performance from period to period using the same metrics utilized by management and also allows investors to evaluate our performance relative to other companies that are not subject to such factors. Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), is not a measure of net income, income from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and is subject to important limitations. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\ufeff\nFree Cash Flow\n\ufeff\nWe utilize free cash flow to evaluate the cash generated by our operations and results of operations. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment (inclusive of the purchase and development of software and technology) plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment, as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Management believes free cash flow is useful because it provides information to investors regarding the cash that was available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures and other investment needs. Free cash\nflow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as we have non-discretionary expenditures, including, but not limited to, repayment of outstanding balances under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, that is not deducted in calculating free cash flow.\n\ufeff\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to cash provided by operating activities as a cash flow measurement.\n\ufeff\nResults of Operations\n\ufeff\nWe made acquisitions in the first quarter and third quarter of 2017. For additional information about these acquisitions, see Note 4. Acquisitions\u201d of our consolidated financial statements. Due to these acquisitions, our results of operations for the 2018 and 2017 periods presented may not be comparable to historical results of operations for the prior periods.

$227.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $201.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of sales of our well construction products as well as the contributions from Repeat Precision and tracer diagnostics services, both of which were added through acquisitions completed during 2017. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in fracturing systems product sales and services, especially in Canada. Product sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $156.8 million as compared to $144.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our service revenue was $70.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nCost of sales\n\ufeff\nCost of sales was $108.3 million, or 47.7% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $98.8 million, or 49.0% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cost of sales was primarily a result of higher cost of services due to increased services revenue resulting from the full year inclusion of tracer diagnostics services. Cost of sales was a lower percentage of revenues due to higher sales volumes for well construction products and at Repeat Precision, which enabled better utilization of fixed costs, partially offset by reduced fixed cost utilization related to a reduction in fracturing systems product sales and services, especially in Canada and higher cost of sales in tracer diagnostics, related to field service staffing levels and increased chemicals costs associated with tariffs imposed on certain imports from China in September 2018. Cost of product sales was $74.9 million or 47.8% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $33.4 million or 47.6% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, cost of product sales was $76.3 million or 52.7% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $22.5 million or 39.5% of service revenue.\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $82.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $64.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was the direct result of headcount additions in substantially all functional areas, twelve months of operations for tracer diagnostics services and Repeat Precision and an increase in share-based compensation related to the issuance of restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) and performance stock unit awards ( PSUs\u201d) during the first quarter of 2018 as well as amendments to certain stock options in connection with our IPO during the second quarter of 2017 that were to vest only in connection with a change of control (the Liquidity Options\u201d). The increases were partially offset by a reduction in our bonus accrual during the year ended December 31, 2018 and significant non-capitalizable additional expenses incurred related to our IPO of $2.3 million and acquisition costs of $1.0 million incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017, but not incurred in the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation\n\ufeff\nDepreciation was $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is attributable to a higher level of property and equipment, primarily related to our acquisitions in 2017 and capital expenditures made during 2018.\n\ufeff\nAmortization\n\ufeff\nAmortization was $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in amortization was related to intangible assets that became fully amortized during the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in amortizable intangible assets related to our acquisitions in 2017.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\n\ufeff\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration was $(2.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $5.5\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the revaluation of the earn-out obligations associated with our acquisitions. The fair value of contingent consideration reflects the impact of both actual results and forecasted future earnings, as well as the consideration of time from the current period to the payment date. As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the Spectrum earnout was $0.0 million, as no payment is currently expected, and the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the Repeat earnout was $10.0 million.\n\ufeff\nImpairments\n\ufeff\nDuring the fourth quarter, as a result of unfavorable oil and gas industry market conditions in late 2018 that have continued to persist into early 2019, and the related impact on expected customer activity levels, particularly in Canada, as well as a decline in the quoted price of our common stock, NCS recorded a total of $227.5 million of charges for the impairment of certain assets. These charges include:\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 A $6.9 million non-cash impairment of customer relationships related to our fracturing systems and well construction products and services \n \u00b7 A $66.6 million non-cash impairment of technology related to our fracturing systems and well construction products and services \n \u00b7 A $122.1 million non-cash impairment of goodwill related to our fracturing systems and well construction products and services \n \u00b7 A $31.9 million non-cash impairment of goodwill related to tracer diagnostics \n\ufeff\nSee Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 7. Goodwill and Intangibles\u201d of our consolidated financial statements for additional detail related to these charges.\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net was $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in interest expense, net was primarily a result of prepaying our prior term loan in full in May 2017 by utilizing a portion of the proceeds from our IPO. The decrease was partially offset by higher interest expense due to borrowing $20.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility in August 2017.\n\ufeff\nOther income, net\n\ufeff\nOther income, net was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Other income, net was lower primarily due to the receipt of $0.9 million from an arbitration case that was decided in our favor in February 2017.\n\ufeff\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n\ufeff\nIncome tax benefit was $(23.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to an expense of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our effective income tax rates were 11.1% and 34.1%, respectively. The income tax benefit and effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was significantly impacted by the income tax rate change from 35% to 21% and the one time impairment charge which resulted in a corresponding decrease in the effective tax rate of 15.7%. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the income tax expense and effective tax rate differences included several offsetting items, including the effect of recording a tax expense for the enacted U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the 2017 Tax Act of $3.9 million, not providing U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because we intended to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. and a tax benefit for the reversal of our deferred tax liability due to the change in our foreign unremitted earnings assertion of $3.9 million. During the first quarter of 2017, we changed our assertion to state that undistributed foreign earnings are indefinitely or permanently reinvested as a result of cash proceeds received from the IPO during May 2017, a portion of which was used to pay off existing debt.\n\ufeff\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The ultimate impact of the 2017 Tax Act may differ from our estimates, possibly materially, due to changes in the interpretations and assumptions made as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the 2017 Tax Act.\n\ufeff\nThe 2017 Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of 2017, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. Our preliminary estimate of the 2017 Tax Act and the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities is subject to the finalization of management's analysis related to certain matters, such as developing interpretations of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, changes to certain estimates and the filing of our tax returns. U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting the 2017 Tax Act may require further adjustments and changes in our estimates. Those adjustments may impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.\n\ufeff\nFor our calendar year beginning in 2018 we are subject to several provisions of the 2017 Tax Act including computations under Global Intangible Low Taxed Income ( GILTI\u201d) and Foreign Derived Intangible Income ( FDII\u201d). We were able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of each provision of the 2017 Tax Act on our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\nOn a longer term basis, certain aspects of the 2017 Tax Act are expected to have a positive impact on our future income tax expense, including the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate.\n\ufeff\nAs a result of the geographic mix of earnings and losses, including discrete items, our tax rate has been and will continue to be volatile.\n\ufeff\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\n\ufeff\nRevenues\n\ufeff\nRevenues were $201.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $98.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in volume of sales of our completions products and services due to higher drilling and well completion activity in North America as a result of an improved commodity price environment in 2017 as compared to 2016 as well as the contribution of Repeat Precision and four months of revenue from Spectrum. Product sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $144.7 million as compared to $73.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our service revenue was $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\ufeff\nCost of sales\n\ufeff\nCost of sales was $98.8 million, or 49.0% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $53.8 million, or 54.7% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cost of sales was primarily a result of a higher number of wells completed and a higher volume of product sales as well as the effect of Repeat Precision and four months of cost of sales from Spectrum. Cost of sales were a lower percentage of revenues due to the higher volume of well completions and sliding sleeve and AirLock system sales, resulting in greater absorption of fixed costs. Cost of product sales was $76.3 million or 52.7% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $22.5 million or 39.5% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, cost of product sales was $40.5 million or 55.3% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $13.3 million or 52.7% of service revenue.\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $64.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was the direct result of headcount additions in substantially all functional areas. In addition, there were significant non-capitalizable additional expenses incurred related to our IPO of $2.3 million, subsequent costs related to operating as a public company, expenses related to the acquisitions, the effect of Repeat Precision and four months of operations from Spectrum and an increase in share-based compensation related to the issuance of RSUs and amendments to our Liquidity Options certain stock options that were to vest only in connection with a change of control as discussed in Note 12. Share-Based Compensation\u201d of our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation\n\ufeff\nDepreciation was $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is attributable to a higher level of property and equipment, primarily related to our acquisitions.\n\ufeff\nAmortization\n\ufeff\nAmortization was $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The majority of the increase in amortization was due to an increase in amortizable intangible assets related to our acquisitions and the increase in the average exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\n\ufeff\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration was $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the $5.5 million increase in the fair value of the earn-outs associated with our acquisitions. The fair value of contingent consideration reflects the impact of both actual results and forecasted future earnings, as well as the consideration of time from the current period to the payment date. As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the Spectrum earnout was $3.4 million and the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the Repeat earnout was $9.4 million.\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in interest expense, net was primarily a result of prepaying our prior credit agreement in full in May 2017 by utilizing a portion of the proceeds from our IPO. The decrease was partially offset by the write-off of the remaining loan fees of $1.4 million associated with the prepayment of the prior credit agreement and interest expense due to borrowing $20.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility in August 2017.\n\ufeff\nOther income, net\n\ufeff\nOther income, net was $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $45 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other income, net was higher primarily due to the receipt of $0.9 million from an arbitration case that was decided in our favor in February 2017.\n\ufeff\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss)\n\ufeff\nForeign currency exchange gain was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a loss of $(2.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily due to the impact of the retirement of our foreign currency denominated debt and changes in the foreign currency exchange rates between the periods.\n\ufeff\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n\ufeff\nIncome tax expense (benefit) was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a benefit of $(8.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our effective income tax rates were 34.1% and 33.0%, respectively. The primary differences between these effective tax rates were due to several offsetting items, including the effects of recording a tax expense for the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the 2017 Tax Act of $3.9 million, not providing U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. and a tax benefit for the reversal of our deferred tax liability due to the change in our foreign unremitted earnings assertion of $3.9 million. During the first quarter of 2017, we changed our assertion to state that undistributed foreign earnings are indefinitely or permanently reinvested as a result of cash proceeds received from the IPO during May 2017, a portion of which was used to pay off existing debt.\n\ufeff\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The ultimate impact of the 2017 Tax Act may differ from our estimates, possibly materially, due to changes in the interpretations and assumptions made as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the 2017 Tax Act.\n\ufeff\nThe 2017 Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of 2017, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. We have reasonably estimated the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and recorded amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a tax benefit of $0.5 million for the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% and recorded a mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries of $4.4 million.\n\ufeff\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\ufeff\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $25.1 million and availability under the Senior Secured Credit Facility of $55.0 million. Our total indebtedness was $25.7 million as of December 31, 2018. Our principal liquidity needs have been, and are expected to continue to be, capital expenditures, working capital, debt service and potential mergers and acquisitions.\n\ufeff\nWe plan to incur approximately $9 million to $13 million in capital expenditures during 2019, which includes capital expenditures related to (i) additional machining capacity at Repeat Precision, (ii) additional production equipment and instrumentation to support our tracer diagnostics services, (iii) machinery and equipment utilized in manufacturing and engineering and (iv) the remainder of the estimated spending for our research and development facility. Our capital expenditures, including the purchase and development of software and technology, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $15.8 million, $5.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Our 2018 capital expenditures included our investment in the research and development facility and an enterprise resource planning system. We believe our cash on hand, cash flows from operations and potential borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditure and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months.\n\ufeff\nWe anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity, it will be funded through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the proceeds of equity issuances, or a combination thereof. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain this additional liquidity on reasonable terms, or at all. Our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and fund our capital requirements are also dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial and other factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from\noperations or that funds will be available from additional indebtedness, the capital markets or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs. If we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions, we may incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance such acquisitions, which could result in additional expenses or dilution.\n\ufeff\nCash Flows and Free Cash Flow\n\ufeff\nThe following table provides a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented (in thousands):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>14,026 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>16,114 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>10,684 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(15,410) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(85,221) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,840) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(5,130) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>84,033 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(315) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(2,164) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>608 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>201 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(8,678) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>15,534 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>8,730 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFree cash flow (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(1,384) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>11,048 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>9,844 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n (1) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment (inclusive of the purchase and development of software and technology) plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment. Management believes free cash flow is useful because it provides information to investors regarding the cash that was available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures and other investment needs. Free cash flow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as we have non-discretionary expenditures, including, but not limited to, repayment of outstanding balances under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, that are not deducted in calculating free cash flow. A reconciliation of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to free cash flow for the periods indicated is as follows (in thousands): \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>14,026 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>16,114 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>10,684 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchases of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(11,134) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(5,366) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,157) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase and development of software and technology\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(4,675) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(54) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProceeds from sales of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>399 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>354 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>317 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFree cash flow\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(1,384) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>11,048 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>9,844 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nOperating Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $14.0 million compared to $16.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in 2018 was primarily related to lower net income as a result of one-time impairment charges of $227.5 million and significantly higher cash taxes paid, partially offset by the addback of the non-cash impairment charges, a smaller increase in non-tax net working capital accounts in addition to increased business activity.\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $16.1 million and $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2017 was primarily related to higher net income and higher levels of non-cash expenses, including share-based compensation and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration. The increase was partially offset by changes in working capital including higher accounts receivable, inventories and income taxes payable and a decrease in accounts payable.\n\ufeff\nInvesting Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in investing activities was $15.4 million and $85.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily related to the $81.2 million funding of two acquisitions during 2017. See Note 4. Acquisitions\u201d in our consolidated financial statements. The decrease was partially offset by capital expenditures, including property, equipment, software and technology, of $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $5.4 million for the same period in 2017.\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in investing activities was $85.2 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the $81.2 million funding of two acquisitions. We also incurred an additional $4.2 million of capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 in comparison to the same period in 2016. The increase is primarily\nattributable to the growth of our business and capital expenditures for Repeat Precision and Spectrum. The increase was partially offset by a $1.0 million note receivable repayment during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nFinancing Activities\n\ufeff\nThe net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $(5.1) million as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $84.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change between net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily related to net proceeds from the completion of our IPO on May 3, 2017 of $148.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses, borrowings of $20.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility during the third quarter of 2017 and distributions of $2.3 million made to our joint venture partner during the third and fourth quarters of 2018. The decreases were partially offset by the $89.1 million repayment of the prior term loan under our prior credit agreement during the second quarter of 2017.\n\ufeff\nThe net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $84.0 million as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $(0.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to net proceeds of $148.9 million from our IPO after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. Additionally, we borrowed $20.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. The increases were partially offset by $89.1 million of note repayments of the prior credit agreement.\n\ufeff\nFinancing Arrangement\n\ufeff\nOn May 4, 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Pioneer Investment, Inc., as borrower (the U.S. Borrower\u201d), NCS Multistage Inc., as borrower (the Canadian Borrower\u201d), Pioneer Intermediate, Inc. (together with the Company, the Parent Guarantors\u201d) and the lenders party thereto, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as administrative agent in respect of the U.S. Facility (as defined below) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Canadian Branch as administrative agent in respect of the Canadian Facility (as defined below) (the senior secured revolving credit facilities provided thereunder, the Senior Secured Credit Facility\u201d). The Credit Agreement amended and restated the prior credit agreement in its entirety. The Senior Secured Credit Facility will mature on May 4, 2020.\n\ufeff\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facility originally consisted of a (i) senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million made available to the U.S. Borrower (the U.S. Facility\u201d), of which up to $5.0 million may be made available for letters of credit and up to $5.0 million may be made available for swingline loans and (ii) senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million made available to the Canadian Borrower (the Canadian Facility\u201d).\n\ufeff\nWe entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement on August 31, 2017, which increased the loan commitment available to the U.S. Borrower to $50.0 million from $25.0 million under the U.S. Facility. The loan commitment available under the Canadian Facility remained at $25.0 million. On February 16, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement and, on October 9, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement, each of which amended certain negative covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2018, we had $20.0 million in outstanding indebtedness under the U.S. Facility and no outstanding indebtedness under the Canadian Facility.\n\ufeff\nBorrowings under the U.S. Facility may be made in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars or Euros and bear interest at a rate equal to the Adjusted Base Rate or Eurocurrency Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), in each case, plus an applicable interest margin as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Canadian Facility may be made in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars and bear interest at the Canadian (Cdn) Base Rate, Canadian (U.S.) Base Rate, Eurocurrency Rate or Discount Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), in each case, plus an applicable interest margin as set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Adjusted Base Rate, Canadian (U.S.) Base Rate and Canadian (Cdn) Base Rate applicable margin will be between 2.25% and 3.00% and Eurocurrency Rate applicable margin will be between 3.25% and 4.00%, in each case, depending on the Company's leverage ratio. The applicable interest rate at December 31, 2018 was 5.88%.\n\ufeff\nThe obligations of the U.S. Borrower under the U.S. Facility are guaranteed by the Parent Guarantors and each of the other existing and future direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries of the Company organized under the laws of the United States (subject to certain exceptions) and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Parent Guarantors, the U.S. Borrower and such other subsidiary guarantors, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens. The obligations of the Canadian Borrower under the Canadian Facility are guaranteed by the Parent Guarantors, the U.S. Borrower and each of the future direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries of the Company organized under the laws of the United States and Canada (subject to certain exceptions) and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Parent Guarantors, the U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower and such subsidiary guarantors, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens.\n\ufeff\nThe Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require (i) commencing with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017, compliance with a leverage ratio test set at (A) 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending prior to March 31, 2018 and (B) 2.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending on or after March 31, 2018, (ii) commencing with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017, compliance with an interest coverage ratio test set at 2.75 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, (iii) if the leverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter is greater than 2.00 to 1.00 and the amount outstanding under the Canadian Facility at any time during such fiscal quarter was greater than $0, compliance as of the end of such fiscal quarter with a Canadian asset coverage ratio test set at 1.00 to 1.00 and (iv) if the leverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter is greater than 2.00 to 1.00 and the amount outstanding under the U.S. Facility at any time during such fiscal quarter was greater than $0, compliance as of the end of such fiscal quarter with a U.S. asset coverage ratio test set at 1.00 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. The Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on the creation of liens, the incurrence of indebtedness, investments, dividends and other restricted payments, dispositions and transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default for facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable). If an event of default occurs, the lenders under each of the U.S. Facility and the Canadian Facility may elect (after the expiration of any applicable notice or grace periods) to declare all outstanding borrowings under such facility, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under each of the U.S. Facility and the Canadian Facility also have the right upon an event of default thereunder to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings under such facility. Further, following an event of default under each of the U.S. Facility and the Canadian Facility, the lenders thereunder will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such facility.\n\ufeff\nContractual Obligations\n\ufeff\nThe following table presents our contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3- 5 years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital lease obligations including interest payments\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,625 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,768 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,659 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>198 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSenior Secured Credit Facility and other debt\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>22,412 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>666 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>21,746 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,767 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,301 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>466 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEarn-outs for the acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9,963 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>9,963 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax payable related to the 2017 Tax Act (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>456 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>43 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>87 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>190 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>136 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEquipment and office operating leases\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6,024 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,867 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,033 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>726 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>398 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>44,247 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>16,608 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>25,991 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,114 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>534 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n (1) The 2017 Tax Act includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result, all previously unremitted earnings for which no U.S. deferred tax liability had been accrued have now been subject to U.S. tax. The income tax payable related to the 2017 Tax Act is due in installments in varying percentages over the next seven years. \n\ufeff\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\ufeff\nWe have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements with the exception of operating leases.\n\ufeff\nEffects of Inflation\n\ufeff\nWe do not believe that the effects of inflation have had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, if our costs become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to offset such increased costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to offset any such cost increases in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\ufeff\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. The accounting policies that we believe to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and that require the most complex and subjective management judgments are discussed below.\n\ufeff\nRevenue Recognition\n\ufeff\nWe derive our revenues primarily from highly engineered products and support services. Revenues are based upon a purchase order, contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer that includes a fixed or determinable price, provided that collectability is reasonably assured, but such arrangements do not generally include right of return or other similar provisions or other significant post-delivery obligations. Sales and value added taxes that we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (i) identify the contract, (ii) identify the performance obligations, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price and (v) satisfy the performance obligation. No single customer individually accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue during the year ended 2018. One customer accounted for 12% of our trade receivable accounts balance as of December 31, 2018, with the majority of the balance collected in January 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized revenue from our largest customer totaling $27.4 million, or 14% of total revenue for the year. Amounts due from this customer included in trade accounts receivable was $2.0 million, or 4% of trade accounts receivable, as of December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the same customer accounted for $25.5 million, or approximately 26% of total revenue, and as of December 31, 2016, $7.8 million in trade accounts receivable were due from this customer, or 24% of trade accounts receivable. No other customer individually accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue during 2017 and 2016 or trade receivable accounts balance as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\n\ufeff\nOn occasion, we issue credits to our customers that are related specifically to the performance of our products or the services we provide, with such credits reducing the amount of revenue for that sale or job. Such credits are infrequent, situation-specific and cannot be estimated in advance.\n\ufeff\nThe payment terms and conditions in our customer contracts vary. We do not have contracts that contain a financing component and do not accept noncash consideration from customers.\n\ufeff\nNCS has elected to recognize shipping and handling costs when the control of the product transfers to the customer. These costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\ufeff\nProduct Sales Revenues\n\ufeff\nFor product sale arrangements that are standard inventory products or modified inventory products with an alternative use, revenue is recognized at a point in time when control transfers. Control generally transfers upon shipment or delivery, and delivery is based on the customer instructions. Customers may also request bill and hold arrangements in writing. Once we have completed the bill and hold order, the products are segregated from the rest of inventory in the warehouse. The transaction price for product sales having a performance obligation is the price per unit times the unit quantity ordered and shipped to the customer or consumed at the well site.\n\ufeff\nServices Revenue\n\ufeff\nFor service arrangements that do not have a contract provision with a right to a payment for services up to the date of termination, revenue is recognized when the job has been completed, which usually includes a customer signature or acknowledgement and when there are no additional services or future obligations required by us. The transaction price is determined by the contract unit day rate times the cumulative number of days of service provided upon the completion of the service and upon customer acceptance.\n\ufeff\nFor service arrangements that do have a contract provision with a right to payment for services up to the date of termination, revenue is recognized over time using a unit rate (labor and materials) output method that corresponds to the value we would receive upon termination of the contract at a reporting period. In applying the output method at the end of a quarter, we check that there is no material work in progress that is not in the measurement of the output. The transaction price for the period end is determined by the contract unit rate times the cumulative number of units earned up to the reporting period less any revenue recognized in prior periods.\n\ufeff\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\ufeff\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Earnings are charged with a provision for doubtful accounts based on a current review of the collectability of customer accounts by management. Such allowances are based upon several factors including, but not limited to, credit approval practices, industry and customer historical experience as well as the current and projected financial condition of the specific customer. Accounts deemed uncollectible are applied against the allowance for doubtful accounts. We have recorded $0.3 million and $11 thousand in provisions for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\ufeff\nInventories\n\ufeff\nInventories consist primarily of raw material, sliding sleeve components, assembled sliding sleeves, certain components used to internally construct our frac isolation assemblies, assembled well construction products and components, composite plugs and components and chemicals, in raw material or finished goods, used for frac diagnostics testing and reporting. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost is determined at standard costs approximating the first-in first-out basis with the exception of chemical costs, which are determined using average costing. We continuously evaluate inventories, based on an analysis of inventory levels, historical sales experience and future sales forecasts, to determine obsolete, slow-moving and excess inventory. Adjustments to reduce such inventory to its estimated recoverable value have been recorded by management as an adjustment to cost of sales.\n\ufeff\nImpairments\n\ufeff\nWe evaluate our property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability based on undiscounted future net cash flows. Should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value. Estimating future net cash flows requires us to make judgements regarding long-term forecasts of future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. These forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about our revenue growth, operating margins, capital expenditures, future market conditions and technological developments. If changes in these assumptions occur, our expectations regarding future net cash flows may change such that a material impairment could result. As a result of unfavorable oil and gas industry market conditions in late 2018 that have continued to persist into early 2019 and the related impact on expected customer activity levels, particularly in Canada, as well as a decline in the quoted price of our common stock, we determined that the carrying values of certain long-lived assets in one of our asset groups were no longer recoverable, which resulted in an impairment charge of $73.5 million related to identifiable intangible assets, which we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. There was no impairment related to fixed assets in 2018. No fixed asset or finite-lived intangible impairments were recorded in 2017 or 2016. See Note 7. Goodwill and Intangibles\u201d of our consolidated financial statements for additional detail related to these charges.\n\ufeff\nAn assessment for goodwill impairment is performed annually or when there is an indication an impairment may have occurred. We typically complete our annual impairment test for goodwill using an assessment date in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets (including allocated goodwill) to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a combination of a market multiple and a discounted cash flow approach. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of estimates, assumptions and judgement. The principal estimates and assumptions that we use include revenue growth, operating margins, capital expenditures, future market conditions, weighted average costs of capital, a terminal growth rate, the set of comparable companies utilized, and the earnings metrics and multiples utilized. We believe that the estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments are reasonable. If the reporting unit's carrying value is greater than its calculated fair value, we recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its calculated fair value. At December 31, 2018, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test on each of our three reporting units and as a result of unfavorable oil and gas industry market conditions in late 2018 that have continued to persist into early 2019 and the related impact on expected customer activity levels, particularly in Canada, as well as a decline in the quoted price of our common stock, we concluded that there had been an impairment because the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair values for two reporting units, which resulted in an impairment charge of $154.0 million. No impairments were recorded in 2017 or 2016. See Note 7. Goodwill and Intangibles\u201d of our consolidated financial statements for additional detail related to these charges.\n\ufeff\nProperty and Equipment\n\ufeff\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Equipment held under capital leases are stated at the present value of minimum lease payments. Expenditures for property and equipment and for items which substantially increase the useful lives of existing assets are capitalized at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful life utilizing the straight-line method. Routine expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements and property under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the remaining lease term or useful life of the related asset. Depreciation expense includes amortization of assets under capital leases. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are recognized in other (expense) income, net in the year of disposal.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation on property and equipment, including assets held under capital leases, is calculated using the straight-line method over the following useful service lives or lease term (which includes reasonably assured renewal periods):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBuildings\n</td> <td>30 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBuilding equipment\n</td> <td>5 - 15 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMachinery and equipment\n</td> <td>5 - 12 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFurniture and fixtures\n</td> <td>3 - 5 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nComputers and software\n</td> <td>3 - 5 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVehicles and rental equipment\n</td> <td>3 - 4 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLeasehold improvements\n</td> <td>\nLease term (1-5)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\ufeff\nBusiness combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 805, Business Combinations. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total consideration transferred in connection with the acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree based on their fair values. Goodwill acquired in connection with business combinations represents the excess of consideration transferred over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Certain assumptions and estimates are employed in evaluating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These estimates may be affected by factors such as changing market conditions, technological advances in the oil and natural gas industry or changes in regulations governing that industry. The most significant assumptions requiring judgment involve identifying and estimating the fair value of intangible assets and the associated useful lives for establishing amortization periods. To finalize purchase accounting for significant acquisitions, we utilize the services of independent valuation specialists to assist in the determination of the fair value of acquired intangible assets.\n\ufeff\nCosts related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issuance of debt or equity securities, that we incur in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.\n\ufeff\nAny contingent consideration payable is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Liability-classified contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until the contingent consideration is settled.\n\ufeff\nAll identifiable intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life or term of related agreements. Deferred loan costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method. Certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software applications are capitalized and costs incurred outside of the software application development stage are expensed as incurred. The amounts capitalized are included in intangibles, categorized as internally developed software, and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software when it is ready for its intended use. These assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes\n\ufeff\nWe are taxed as a corporation as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. The liability method is used in accounting for deferred income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. The realizability of deferred tax assets is evaluated annually and a valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not give rise to future benefits. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, based upon technical merits, upon examination by the taxing authorities. If the income tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria, the benefit recorded in the consolidated financial statements equals the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon its ultimate settlement. A valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the valuation allowance was $1.1 million and $18 thousand, respectively. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in other income (expense). During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in interest and penalties. We had $0.6 million and $0.6 million in interest and penalties accrued at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\ufeff\nOne of our Canadian subsidiaries guaranteed the credit facilities of our U.S. entities until May 2017 when cash proceeds were received from the IPO, a portion of which was used to pay off the existing debt. Under U.S. federal income tax rules, this guarantee resulted in all of the earnings and profits of our Canadian subsidiary being subject to current U.S. tax. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act and a change in our permanent earnings reinvestment assertion, we have recognized a U.S. tax benefit for the reversal of our deferred\ntax liability on a portion of our differences between book value and tax basis in our Canadian subsidiary for which we are now asserting indefinite reinvestment. No U.S. deferred tax liabilities have been recognized on the differences between book value and tax basis that we continue to indefinitely reinvest. Upon reversal of these book value and tax basis differences through dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to foreign withholding taxes. It is not practical, however, to estimate the amount of taxes that may be payable on the eventual remittance of these temporary differences after consideration of available foreign tax credits.\n\ufeff\nWe completed our analysis of our tax positions and believe there are no material uncertain tax positions that would require derecognition in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. We believe that there are no tax positions taken or expected to be taken that would significantly increase or decrease unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months following the balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no material amounts that had been accrued with respect to uncertain tax positions.\n\ufeff\nNo valuation allowances have been provided for the $9.3 million U.S. deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2018. The Company believes it is more likely than not to realize the benefit of this asset. The Company has historically been a U.S. taxpayer and projects future operations will generate sufficient taxable income. However, in the event the Company has a change in circumstances which would change management's judgment regarding the ability to generate sufficient U.S. taxable income, a valuation allowance would be recorded against the U.S. deferred tax asset.\n\ufeff\nWe file income tax returns in the United States, Canada and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Our U.S. income tax returns for 2011 and subsequent years remain open for examination. The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) commenced an examination of our United States income tax returns for 2011 through 2012 in the first quarter of 2014 which was completed in 2015. No tax adjustments were proposed. Additionally, subsequent to December 31, 2015, the IRS commenced an examination of our United States income tax return for 2014 in the second quarter of 2016, which was completed in 2017. No tax adjustments were proposed. During 2018, the Canada Revenue Agency ( CRA\u201d) commenced an examination of our transfer pricing on Canadian income tax returns for the 2012 through 2015 filings and no tax adjustments have been proposed.\n\ufeff\nShare-Based Compensation\n\ufeff\nWe account for our stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation- Stock Compensation ( ASC 718\u201d). We recognize compensation cost for all share-based payment transactions, including compensation cost associated with the grant of options, RSUs and PSUs for our common stock using the Black-Scholes model for options, the market price of the common stock on the date of the grant for the RSUs and a Monte Carlo simulation for the PSUs. Expense is recognized ratably from one to five years based upon the requisite service period. We also have an ESPP, which allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of the stock price at the beginning or end of the offering period. The fair value of the employees' purchase rights under the ESPP is estimated using the Black-Scholes model. For additional information, see Note 12. Share-Based Compensation\u201d of our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\ufeff\nSee Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of the accounting pronouncements we recently adopted and the accounting pronouncements recently issued by the FASB.\n\ufeff\nEmerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status\n\ufeff\nWe are an emerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act\u201d). We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of our fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. Additionally, we are also a smaller reporting company\u201d as defined by Section 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act\u201d), meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $250 million. As an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, we may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies that do not qualify for those classifications.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as of, and for, the periods presented. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the sections entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d -Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Item 6. Selected Historical Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This section and other parts of the Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements regarding the industry outlook, estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial and industry trends that may affect our future results of operations or financial condition and other non-historical statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties described in -Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\n\ufeff\nOverview and Outlook\n\ufeff\nWe are a leading provider of highly engineered products and support services that facilitate the optimization of oil and natural gas well completions and field development strategies. We provide our products and services primarily to E&P companies for use in onshore wells, predominantly wells that have been drilled with horizontal laterals in unconventional oil and natural gas formations. Our products and services are utilized in oil and natural gas basins throughout North America and in selected international markets, including Argentina, China, Russia and the North Sea. We provided our products and services to over 310 customers in 2018, including leading large independent oil and natural gas companies and major oil companies.\n\ufeff\nOur primary offering is our fracturing systems products and services, which enable efficient pinpoint stimulation: the process of individually stimulating each entry point into a formation targeted by an oil or natural gas well. Our fracturing systems products and services are typically utilized in cemented wellbores and enable our customers to precisely place stimulation treatments in a more controlled and repeatable manner as compared with traditional completion techniques. Our fracturing systems products and services are utilized in conjunction with third-party providers of pressure pumping, coiled tubing and other services.\n\ufeff\nWe sell products for well construction, including our AirLock casing buoyancy system, liner hanger systems and toe initiation sleeves. We provide tracer diagnostics services for well completion and reservoir characterization that utilize downhole chemical and radioactive tracers and consult on reservoir strategies by providing engineering services. Repeat Precision sells composite frac plugs and related products and provides third-party manufacturing services. We operate in one reportable segment.\n\ufeff\nBased on recent commodity prices and preliminary budgets set by E&P companies, we believe that industry drilling and completions activity in North America will be lower in 2019 than it was in 2018. Many of our customers in North America have begun to prioritize free cash flow and the return of capital to shareholders over production growth, which is leading to lower levels of capital expenditures. This is due in part to relatively low commodity prices at the time our customers established their budgets and also concerns over global demand for oil and natural gas based on macroeconomic conditions. We expect customer activity in the U.S. to decline slightly on a year-over-year basis, with activity levels declining in early 2019 from year-end 2018 levels, with the possibility for activity to improve over the course of the year. We believe that customer activity in Canada could be significantly below levels seen in prior years, especially in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter in prior years. This is due to the factors mentioned above and also due to elevated commodity price differentials and mandatory production curtailments imposed on certain operators in Alberta. Market conditions in Canada have resulted in continued customer and competitor-driven pricing pressure for our products and services, negatively impacting our margins and market share in certain markets. We currently expect international activity to increase slightly in 2019 as market conditions remain more constructive than in North America.\n\ufeff\nMarket Conditions\n\ufeff\nOil and Natural Gas Drilling and Completion Activity\n\ufeff\nOur products and services are primarily sold to North American E&P companies and our ability to generate revenues from our products and services depends upon oil and natural gas drilling and production activity in North America. Oil and natural gas drilling and production activity is directly related to oil and natural gas prices.\n\ufeff\nOil and natural gas prices remain volatile, with WTI crude oil pricing falling to a low of approximately $26 per barrel in February 2016 before recovering to approximately $60 per barrel by the end of December 2017 and then falling again to approximately $45 per barrel by the end of December 2018. Crude oil pricing has been supported by voluntary oil production reductions by members of OPEC, and certain other countries, including Russia. These supply reductions were announced in November 2016 and were initially implemented in 2017. In November 2017, OPEC and certain other countries, including Russia, announced their intent to extend the supply reductions through the end of 2018. These countries had reduced their supply by more than the targeted amounts through early 2018, reaching 152% of targeted supply reductions in May 2018. In June 2018, OPEC and certain\nother countries, including Russia, announced that they would strive to conform with the supply reductions at a 100% level as of July 1, 2018, signaling an increase in production from prior levels. In response to falling crude oil prices in late 2018, OPEC and certain other countries, including Russia, agreed to a new round of supply reductions in December 2018, which were intended to be effective as of January 2019. There can be no assurance that the countries involved will continue to comply with the intended reductions and the amount of oil supply that may be returned to the market if the supply reductions are not extended further is unknown.\n\ufeff\nOn August 6, 2018, the United States announced its intent to impose economic sanctions on Iran, following the United States' withdrawal from an international accord intended to limit Iran's nuclear programs. The sanctions, including secondary sanctions targeting companies that do business with Iran, are expected to reduce Iran's level of crude oil exports and went into effect in early November. However, the United States granted temporary waivers to eight countries that import oil from Iran. Other oil exporting countries, including Saudi Arabia and Russia have committed to increase oil supplies to offset any shortfall related to a reduction in Iranian oil exports. There can be no assurance in the level of reduction of Iranian crude exports, the expiration of the temporary waivers or of the ability of other countries to readily supply crude oil to the market if Iranian crude exports decline materially.\n\ufeff\nOver the course of 2018, there was an increase in the difference between the benchmark crude oil pricing in certain markets and WTI, known in the industry as differentials. Crude oil in certain areas, including West Texas, North Dakota and Canada have traded at a larger discount to WTI than in historical periods due to current and forecasted production levels that are in excess of local refining demand and pipeline capacity. In response to these price differentials, many E&P companies operating in these areas reduced their drilling and completion activity in the second half of 2018 and into 2019 or chose to delay completions until additional pipeline or rail capacity is placed into service. In Canada, the Province of Alberta implemented a number of measures intended to reduce the differential in the region, including supporting the purchase of railcars to be utilized to transport oil out of the province and by implementing mandatory production curtailments for companies producing more than 10,000 barrels per day in the province.\n\ufeff\nNatural gas pricing reached a low of approximately $1.50 per MMBtu in March 2016 before recovering to an average level of approximately $3.15 per MMBtu during 2018. Realized natural gas prices for Canadian E&P customers are typically at a discount to U.S. Henry Hub pricing. Spot pricing for Canadian natural gas at the AECO hub has been volatile since mid-2017, with wider-than-normal discounts to Henry Hub pricing resulting from infrastructure bottlenecks. Some Canadian E&P customers have reacted to the lower prices by shutting in a portion of their natural gas production, negatively impacting their cash flows, capital spending and drilling activity.\n\ufeff\nSustained declines in commodity prices, or sustained periods of high differentials, would be expected to lead North American E&P companies to reduce drilling and completion activity, which could negatively impact our business.\n\ufeff\nListed and depicted below are recent crude oil and natural gas pricing trends, as provided by the Energy Information Administration ( EIA\u201d) of the U.S. Department of Energy:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nListed and depicted below are the average number of operating onshore rigs in the U.S. and in Canada per quarter since the first quarter of 2015, as provided by Baker Hughes. The Canadian land rig count illustrates the seasonality of activity in that market:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOver the past several years, North American E&P companies have been able to reduce their cost structures and have also utilized technologies, including ours, to increase efficiency and improve well performance. After a period of declining drilling and completion activity from late 2014 through early 2016, North American E&P companies began to increase activity levels beginning in the second quarter of 2016, as evidenced by increasing rig counts in the U.S. and Canada. The rate of increase slowed in the U.S. starting in the third quarter of 2018 and the average rig count in Canada decreased in 2018 compared to 2017, with the average rig count in the fourth quarter of 2018 13% lower than the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\ufeff\nA substantial portion of our business is subject to quarterly variability. In Canada, we typically experience higher activity levels in the first quarter of each year, as our customers take advantage of the winter freeze to gain access to remote drilling and production areas. In the past, our revenue in Canada has declined during the second quarter due to warming weather conditions that result in thawing, softer ground, difficulty accessing drill sites and road bans that curtail drilling and completion activity. Access to well sites typically improves throughout the third and fourth quarters in Canada, leading to activity levels that are higher than in the second quarter, but lower than activity in the first quarter. Our business can also be impacted by a reduction in customer activity during the winter holidays in late December and early January. We anticipate that activity in Canada in the first quarter of 2019 will be significantly lower than in the first quarter of prior years due to low realized commodity prices resulting from high differentials and the production curtailments that are currently in place in Alberta.\n\ufeff\nThe industry experienced a reduction in completions activity in the United States in the second half of 2018, which has extended into early 2019. In addition, preliminary capital budgets from E&P companies indicate that capital spending in 2019 is expected to be below capital spending in 2018, with a number of customers indicating the intention to reduce the number of rigs and completion crews that they are operating.\n\ufeff\nThe market in Canada continues to be impacted by logistical constraints in moving oil and natural gas from areas of production activity to demand centers. These constraints have led to lower realized pricing for our Canadian customers, which have been partially offset by the initiatives implemented by the Province of Alberta. As a result, industry activity and capital spending in Canada in 2019 is currently forecasted to be materially below 2018 levels, both for producers of oil and liquids-rich natural gas and producers of natural gas. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the average land drilling rig count in Canada, as provided by Baker Hughes, was eight percent lower than during the same period in 2017. The average rig count in Canada for the first nine weeks of 2019 was 33% lower than in the same period in 2018. Commodity price differentials are forecasted to remain at higher-than-normal levels for an extended period of time, which we expect to have a negative impact on customer activity in 2019 and potentially beyond.\nAdoption of Pinpoint Stimulation\n\ufeff\nTraditional well completion techniques, including plug and perf and ball drop, currently account for the majority of unconventional well completions in North America. We believe that pinpoint stimulation provides substantial benefits compared to these traditional well completion techniques. Our ability to grow our market share, as evidenced by the percentage of horizontal wells in North America completed using our products and services, will depend in large part on the industry's further adoption of pinpoint stimulation to complete wells, our ability to continue to innovate our technology to compete against continuing technological advances in competing traditional well completions techniques, and our ability to successfully compete with other providers of pinpoint stimulation products and services, including adjusting our pricing in certain markets to respond to customer demands and to competitors that may provide discounted pricing to our customers.\n\ufeff\nIncreasing Well Complexity and Focus on Completion Optimization\n\ufeff\nIn recent years, E&P companies have drilled longer horizontal wells and completed more hydraulic fracturing stages per well to maximize the volume of hydrocarbon recoveries per well. This trend towards longer and more complex wells has resulted in us selling more sliding sleeves or composite frac plugs per well on average, which increases our revenue opportunity per well completion and has led to increased sales of our AirLock casing buoyancy systems. Additionally, E&P companies have become increasingly focused on well productivity through optimization of completion designs and we believe this trend may further the adoption of pinpoint stimulation, and in turn, increase the opportunity for sales of our products and services if our customers observe operational benefits and long-term production results from the application of pinpoint stimulation. This trend towards more complex well completions has also resulted in increased use of tracer diagnostics services, which can be utilized to assess the effectiveness of various well completion techniques and well spacing strategies in support of completion and field development optimization efforts.\n\ufeff\nAcquisitions\n\ufeff\nOn August 31, 2017, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Spectrum in exchange for approximately $83 million. Spectrum offers chemical and radioactive tracer diagnostics services that our customers utilize to better characterize their assets and to optimize completion designs. Chemical and radioactive tracer studies may provide a cost-effective and reliable means to determine the production profile along a lateral, assess fluid and proppant communication between wells during completions and determine stage and cluster level efficiency of completion designs. We believe Spectrum's tracer diagnostics services strengthens our ability to provide our customers with actionable data and analysis to optimize oil and natural gas well completions and field development strategies.\n\ufeff\nOn February 1, 2017, we acquired a 50% interest in Repeat Precision for $6.0 million. Repeat Precision has historically been a supplier to NCS. Our strategic purchase of 50% of this business ensures that we have continued access to their machining services and allows us greater control of the allocation of Repeat Precision's capacity, ensuring that we can scale their operations together with ours. In addition, Repeat Precision also markets certain completion products on a wholesale basis, providing an additional revenue opportunity.\nOn January 31, 2019, the cash payment of $10.0 million for the Repeat Precision earn-out consideration was paid to the joint venture partner. In connection with the Spectrum acquisition, we may need to pay the sellers additional consideration as part of an earn-out upon meeting certain specified targets. For additional information regarding our 2017 acquisitions, see Note 4. Acquisitions\u201d of our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nHow We Generate Revenues\n\ufeff\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from the sale of our fracturing systems products and the provision of related services. The remainder of our revenues are generated from sales of our AirLock casing buoyancy system, liner hanger systems, toe initiation sleeves and tracer diagnostics and reservoir strategies services. Repeat Precision generates revenue through the sale of composite frac plugs and related products and the provision of third-party manufacturing services.\n\ufeff\nProduct sales represented 69%, 72% and 74% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Most of our sales are on a just-in-time basis, as specified in individual purchase orders, with a fixed price for our products. We occasionally supply our customers with large orders that may be filled on negotiated terms. Services represented 31%, 28% and 26% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Services include our tool charges and associated services related to our fracturing systems and our tracer diagnostics services (which are classified together as services\u201d in our financial results). Services are provided at agreed rates we charge to our customers for the provision of our downhole frac isolation assembly, our personnel and for the provision of tracer diagnostics services.\n\ufeff\nDuring periods of low drilling and well completion activity or as may be needed to compete in certain markets we will, in certain instances, lower the prices of our products and services. Our revenues are also impacted by well complexity, with wells with more stages resulting in longer jobs and increased revenue attributable to selling more sliding sleeves or composite frac plugs and the provision of our services.\n\ufeff\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, approximately 48%, 63% and 71%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from sales in Canada and were denominated in Canadian dollars. Because our Canadian contracts are typically invoiced in Canadian dollars, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations impact our revenues and are regularly monitored.\n\ufeff\nAlthough most of our sales are to North American E&P companies, we do have sales to customers outside of North America and expect sales to international customers to increase over time. These international sales are made through local NCS entities or to our local operating partners on a free on board or free carrier basis with a point of sale in the United States. Some of the locations in which we have operating partners or sales representatives include China and the Middle East. Our operating partners and representatives do not have authority to contractually bind our company, but market our products in their respective territories as part of their product or service offering.\n\ufeff\nCosts of Conducting our Business\n\ufeff\nOur cost of sales is comprised of expenses relating to the manufacture of our products in addition to the costs of our support services. Manufacturing cost of sales includes payments made to our suppliers for raw materials and payments made to machine shops for the manufacturing of components used in our products and costs related to our employees that perform quality control analysis, assemble and test our products. During the first quarter of 2017, we acquired 50% of Repeat Precision, which has allowed us to reduce our costs for certain product categories. We review forecasted activity levels in our business and either directly procure or ensure that our vendors procure the required raw materials with sufficient lead time to meet our business requirements. On March 8, 2018, the President of the United States signed an order to impose a tariff of 25% on steel imported from certain countries. On July 1, 2018, Canada implemented retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. imports, including steel. While we and our suppliers have locked in pricing for\ncertain raw materials required to support some of our anticipated business activity during 2019, we anticipate that the tariff could result in an increase in our cost of sales during the year. On September 24, 2018, the United States implemented a tariff of 10% on significant number of commodities originating from China, including certain chemicals utilized in our tracer diagnostics business. The tariffs were scheduled to increase to 25% on January 1, 2019 but the increase has been delayed pending ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries. If a trade resolution with China is not reached, the increased tariffs would result in an increase in our cost of sales. We will strive to pass through some of the increases in raw material costs directly resulting from the tariffs to our customers, however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. Cost of sales for support services includes compensation and benefit-related expenses for employees who provide direct revenue generating services to customers in addition to the costs incurred by these employees for travel and subsistence while on site. Cost of sales includes other variable manufacturing costs, such as shrinkage, obsolescence and revaluation or scrap related to our existing inventory and costs related to the chemicals and laboratory analysis associated with our tracer diagnostics services.\n\ufeff\nOur selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses are comprised of compensation expense, which includes compensation and benefit-related expenses for our employees who are not directly involved in revenue generating activities, including those involved in our research and development activities, as well as our general operating costs. These general operating costs include, but are not limited to: rent and occupancy for our facilities, information technology infrastructure, software licensing, advertising and marketing, third party research and development, risk insurance and professional service fees for audit, legal and other consulting services. In 2015 and 2016, in response to decreased demand for our products and services resulting from the decline in E&P activity in our markets, we reduced our headcount and took certain other actions which resulted in restructuring charges, primarily severance expense. As a result of being a public company, our legal, accounting and other expenses have increased and will further increase for costs associated with our compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\ufeff\nThe percentage of our costs, defined as cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, and including SG&A, denominated in Canadian dollars for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, were approximately 21%, 32% and 36%, respectively.\n\ufeff\nHow We Evaluate our Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our results of operations and profitability and include:\n\ufeff\nRevenues\n\ufeff\nWe primarily sell our products and services under purchase orders with pricing negotiated on a one-off basis with each customer. Our revenues are generated primarily from the sales of our fracturing systems, well construction and composite plug products and from services related to the utilization of our downhole frac isolation assembly as well as from the provision of tracer diagnostics services. We compare our actual revenue performance on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis to our annual budget and to the most recent estimate we have for the relevant period and to applicable market metrics.\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude certain items which we believe are not reflective of ongoing operating performance or which, in the case of impairments and share-based compensation, are non-cash in nature. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure that excludes costs that management believes do not reflect our ongoing operating performance and certain costs associated with our capital structure. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric that management uses to assess the period-to-period performance of our core business operations. We believe that presenting Adjusted EBITDA enables investors to assess our performance from period to period using the same metrics utilized by management and also allows investors to evaluate our performance relative to other companies that are not subject to such factors. Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), is not a measure of net income, income from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and is subject to important limitations. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\ufeff\nFree Cash Flow\n\ufeff\nWe utilize free cash flow to evaluate the cash generated by our operations and results of operations. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment (inclusive of the purchase and development of software and technology) plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment, as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Management believes free cash flow is useful because it provides information to investors regarding the cash that was available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures and other investment needs. Free cash\nflow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as we have non-discretionary expenditures, including, but not limited to, repayment of outstanding balances under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, that is not deducted in calculating free cash flow.\n\ufeff\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to cash provided by operating activities as a cash flow measurement.\n\ufeff\nResults of Operations\n\ufeff\nWe made acquisitions in the first quarter and third quarter of 2017. For additional information about these acquisitions, see Note 4. Acquisitions\u201d of our consolidated financial statements. Due to these acquisitions, our results of operations for the 2018 and 2017 periods presented may not be comparable to historical results of operations for the prior periods. The following table summarizes our revenues and expenses for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n (1) NM - Percentage not meaningful \n\ufeff\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\n\ufeff\nRevenues\n\ufeff\nRevenues were $227.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $201.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of sales of our well construction products as well as the contributions from Repeat Precision and tracer diagnostics services, both of which were added through acquisitions completed during 2017. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in fracturing systems product sales and services, especially in Canada. Product sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $156.8 million as compared to $144.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our service revenue was $70.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nCost of sales\n\ufeff\nCost of sales was $108.3 million, or 47.7% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $98.8 million, or 49.0% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cost of sales was primarily a result of higher cost of services due to increased services revenue resulting from the full year inclusion of tracer diagnostics services. Cost of sales was a lower percentage of revenues due to higher sales volumes for well construction products and at Repeat Precision, which enabled better utilization of fixed costs, partially offset by reduced fixed cost utilization related to a reduction in fracturing systems product sales and services, especially in Canada and higher cost of sales in tracer diagnostics, related to field service staffing levels and increased chemicals costs associated with tariffs imposed on certain imports from China in September 2018. Cost of product sales was $74.9 million or 47.8% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $33.4 million or 47.6% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, cost of product sales was $76.3 million or 52.7% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $22.5 million or 39.5% of service revenue.\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $82.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $64.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was the direct result of headcount additions in substantially all functional areas, twelve months of operations for tracer diagnostics services and Repeat Precision and an increase in share-based compensation related to the issuance of restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) and performance stock unit awards ( PSUs\u201d) during the first quarter of 2018 as well as amendments to certain stock options in connection with our IPO during the second quarter of 2017 that were to vest only in connection with a change of control (the Liquidity Options\u201d). The increases were partially offset by a reduction in our bonus accrual during the year ended December 31, 2018 and significant non-capitalizable additional expenses incurred related to our IPO of $2.3 million and acquisition costs of $1.0 million incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017, but not incurred in the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation\n\ufeff\nDepreciation was $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is attributable to a higher level of property and equipment, primarily related to our acquisitions in 2017 and capital expenditures made during 2018.\n\ufeff\nAmortization\n\ufeff\nAmortization was $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in amortization was related to intangible assets that became fully amortized during the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in amortizable intangible assets related to our acquisitions in 2017.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\n\ufeff\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration was $(2.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $5.5\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the revaluation of the earn-out obligations associated with our acquisitions. The fair value of contingent consideration reflects the impact of both actual results and forecasted future earnings, as well as the consideration of time from the current period to the payment date. As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the Spectrum earnout was $0.0 million, as no payment is currently expected, and the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the Repeat earnout was $10.0 million.\n\ufeff\nImpairments\n\ufeff\nDuring the fourth quarter, as a result of unfavorable oil and gas industry market conditions in late 2018 that have continued to persist into early 2019, and the related impact on expected customer activity levels, particularly in Canada, as well as a decline in the quoted price of our common stock, NCS recorded a total of $227.5 million of charges for the impairment of certain assets. These charges include:\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 A $6.9 million non-cash impairment of customer relationships related to our fracturing systems and well construction products and services \n \u00b7 A $66.6 million non-cash impairment of technology related to our fracturing systems and well construction products and services \n \u00b7 A $122.1 million non-cash impairment of goodwill related to our fracturing systems and well construction products and services \n \u00b7 A $31.9 million non-cash impairment of goodwill related to tracer diagnostics \n\ufeff\nSee Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 7. Goodwill and Intangibles\u201d of our consolidated financial statements for additional detail related to these charges.\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net was $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in interest expense, net was primarily a result of prepaying our prior term loan in full in May 2017 by utilizing a portion of the proceeds from our IPO. The decrease was partially offset by higher interest expense due to borrowing $20.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility in August 2017.\n\ufeff\nOther income, net\n\ufeff\nOther income, net was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Other income, net was lower primarily due to the receipt of $0.9 million from an arbitration case that was decided in our favor in February 2017.\n\ufeff\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n\ufeff\nIncome tax benefit was $(23.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to an expense of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our effective income tax rates were 11.1% and 34.1%, respectively. The income tax benefit and effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was significantly impacted by the income tax rate change from 35% to 21% and the one time impairment charge which resulted in a corresponding decrease in the effective tax rate of 15.7%. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the income tax expense and effective tax rate differences included several offsetting items, including the effect of recording a tax expense for the enacted U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the 2017 Tax Act of $3.9 million, not providing U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because we intended to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. and a tax benefit for the reversal of our deferred tax liability due to the change in our foreign unremitted earnings assertion of $3.9 million. During the first quarter of 2017, we changed our assertion to state that undistributed foreign earnings are indefinitely or permanently reinvested as a result of cash proceeds received from the IPO during May 2017, a portion of which was used to pay off existing debt.\n\ufeff\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The ultimate impact of the 2017 Tax Act may differ from our estimates, possibly materially, due to changes in the interpretations and assumptions made as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the 2017 Tax Act.\n\ufeff\nThe 2017 Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of 2017, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. Our preliminary estimate of the 2017 Tax Act and the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities is subject to the finalization of management's analysis related to certain matters, such as developing interpretations of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, changes to certain estimates and the filing of our tax returns. U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting the 2017 Tax Act may require further adjustments and changes in our estimates. Those adjustments may impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.\n\ufeff\nFor our calendar year beginning in 2018 we are subject to several provisions of the 2017 Tax Act including computations under Global Intangible Low Taxed Income ( GILTI\u201d) and Foreign Derived Intangible Income ( FDII\u201d). We were able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of each provision of the 2017 Tax Act on our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\nOn a longer term basis, certain aspects of the 2017 Tax Act are expected to have a positive impact on our future income tax expense, including the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate.\n\ufeff\nAs a result of the geographic mix of earnings and losses, including discrete items, our tax rate has been and will continue to be volatile.\n\ufeff\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\n\ufeff\nRevenues\n\ufeff\nRevenues were $201.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $98.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in volume of sales of our completions products and services due to higher drilling and well completion activity in North America as a result of an improved commodity price environment in 2017 as compared to 2016 as well as the contribution of Repeat Precision and four months of revenue from Spectrum. Product sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $144.7 million as compared to $73.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our service revenue was $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\ufeff\nCost of sales\n\ufeff\nCost of sales was $98.8 million, or 49.0% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $53.8 million, or 54.7% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cost of sales was primarily a result of a higher number of wells completed and a higher volume of product sales as well as the effect of Repeat Precision and four months of cost of sales from Spectrum. Cost of sales were a lower percentage of revenues due to the higher volume of well completions and sliding sleeve and AirLock system sales, resulting in greater absorption of fixed costs. Cost of product sales was $76.3 million or 52.7% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $22.5 million or 39.5% of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, cost of product sales was $40.5 million or 55.3% of product sales revenue and cost of services was $13.3 million or 52.7% of service revenue.\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $64.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was the direct result of headcount additions in substantially all functional areas. In addition, there were significant non-capitalizable additional expenses incurred related to our IPO of $2.3 million, subsequent costs related to operating as a public company, expenses related to the acquisitions, the effect of Repeat Precision and four months of operations from Spectrum and an increase in share-based compensation related to the issuance of RSUs and amendments to our Liquidity Options certain stock options that were to vest only in connection with a change of control as discussed in Note 12. Share-Based Compensation\u201d of our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation\n\ufeff\nDepreciation was $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is attributable to a higher level of property and equipment, primarily related to our acquisitions.\n\ufeff\nAmortization\n\ufeff\nAmortization was $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The majority of the increase in amortization was due to an increase in amortizable intangible assets related to our acquisitions and the increase in the average exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\n\ufeff\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration was $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the $5.5 million increase in the fair value of the earn-outs associated with our acquisitions. The fair value of contingent consideration reflects the impact of both actual results and forecasted future earnings, as well as the consideration of time from the current period to the payment date. As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the Spectrum earnout was $3.4 million and the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the Repeat earnout was $9.4 million.\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net\n\ufeff\nInterest expense, net was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in interest expense, net was primarily a result of prepaying our prior credit agreement in full in May 2017 by utilizing a portion of the proceeds from our IPO. The decrease was partially offset by the write-off of the remaining loan fees of $1.4 million associated with the prepayment of the prior credit agreement and interest expense due to borrowing $20.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility in August 2017.\n\ufeff\nOther income, net\n\ufeff\nOther income, net was $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $45 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other income, net was higher primarily due to the receipt of $0.9 million from an arbitration case that was decided in our favor in February 2017.\n\ufeff\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss)\n\ufeff\nForeign currency exchange gain was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a loss of $(2.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily due to the impact of the retirement of our foreign currency denominated debt and changes in the foreign currency exchange rates between the periods.\n\ufeff\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n\ufeff\nIncome tax expense (benefit) was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a benefit of $(8.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our effective income tax rates were 34.1% and 33.0%, respectively. The primary differences between these effective tax rates were due to several offsetting items, including the effects of recording a tax expense for the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the 2017 Tax Act of $3.9 million, not providing U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. and a tax benefit for the reversal of our deferred tax liability due to the change in our foreign unremitted earnings assertion of $3.9 million. During the first quarter of 2017, we changed our assertion to state that undistributed foreign earnings are indefinitely or permanently reinvested as a result of cash proceeds received from the IPO during May 2017, a portion of which was used to pay off existing debt.\n\ufeff\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The ultimate impact of the 2017 Tax Act may differ from our estimates, possibly materially, due to changes in the interpretations and assumptions made as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the 2017 Tax Act.\n\ufeff\nThe 2017 Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of 2017, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. We have reasonably estimated the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and recorded amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a tax benefit of $0.5 million for the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% and recorded a mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries of $4.4 million.\n\ufeff\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\ufeff\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $25.1 million and availability under the Senior Secured Credit Facility of $55.0 million. Our total indebtedness was $25.7 million as of December 31, 2018. Our principal liquidity needs have been, and are expected to continue to be, capital expenditures, working capital, debt service and potential mergers and acquisitions.\n\ufeff\nWe plan to incur approximately $9 million to $13 million in capital expenditures during 2019, which includes capital expenditures related to (i) additional machining capacity at Repeat Precision, (ii) additional production equipment and instrumentation to support our tracer diagnostics services, (iii) machinery and equipment utilized in manufacturing and engineering and (iv) the remainder of the estimated spending for our research and development facility. Our capital expenditures, including the purchase and development of software and technology, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $15.8 million, $5.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Our 2018 capital expenditures included our investment in the research and development facility and an enterprise resource planning system. We believe our cash on hand, cash flows from operations and potential borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditure and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months.\n\ufeff\nWe anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity, it will be funded through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the proceeds of equity issuances, or a combination thereof. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain this additional liquidity on reasonable terms, or at all. Our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and fund our capital requirements are also dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial and other factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from\noperations or that funds will be available from additional indebtedness, the capital markets or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs. If we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions, we may incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance such acquisitions, which could result in additional expenses or dilution.\n\ufeff\nCash Flows and Free Cash Flow\n\ufeff\nThe following table provides a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented (in thousands):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n_______________\n (1) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment (inclusive of the purchase and development of software and technology) plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment. Management believes free cash flow is useful because it provides information to investors regarding the cash that was available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures and other investment needs. Free cash flow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as we have non-discretionary expenditures, including, but not limited to, repayment of outstanding balances under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, that are not deducted in calculating free cash flow. A reconciliation of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to free cash flow for the periods indicated is as follows (in thousands): \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nOperating Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $14.0 million compared to $16.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in 2018 was primarily related to lower net income as a result of one-time impairment charges of $227.5 million and significantly higher cash taxes paid, partially offset by the addback of the non-cash impairment charges, a smaller increase in non-tax net working capital accounts in addition to increased business activity.\n\ufeff\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $16.1 million and $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2017 was primarily related to higher net income and higher levels of non-cash expenses, including share-based compensation and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration. The increase was partially offset by changes in working capital including higher accounts receivable, inventories and income taxes payable and a decrease in accounts payable.\n\ufeff\nInvesting Activities\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in investing activities was $15.4 million and $85.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily related to the $81.2 million funding of two acquisitions during 2017. See Note 4. Acquisitions\u201d in our consolidated financial statements. The decrease was partially offset by capital expenditures, including property, equipment, software and technology, of $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $5.4 million for the same period in 2017.\n\ufeff\nNet cash used in investing activities was $85.2 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the $81.2 million funding of two acquisitions. We also incurred an additional $4.2 million of capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 in comparison to the same period in 2016. The increase is primarily\nattributable to the growth of our business and capital expenditures for Repeat Precision and Spectrum. The increase was partially offset by a $1.0 million note receivable repayment during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nFinancing Activities\n\ufeff\nThe net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $(5.1) million as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $84.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change between net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily related to net proceeds from the completion of our IPO on May 3, 2017 of $148.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses, borrowings of $20.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility during the third quarter of 2017 and distributions of $2.3 million made to our joint venture partner during the third and fourth quarters of 2018. The decreases were partially offset by the $89.1 million repayment of the prior term loan under our prior credit agreement during the second quarter of 2017.\n\ufeff\nThe net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $84.0 million as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $(0.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to net proceeds of $148.9 million from our IPO after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. Additionally, we borrowed $20.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. The increases were partially offset by $89.1 million of note repayments of the prior credit agreement.\n\ufeff\nFinancing Arrangement\n\ufeff\nOn May 4, 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Pioneer Investment, Inc., as borrower (the U.S. Borrower\u201d), NCS Multistage Inc., as borrower (the Canadian Borrower\u201d), Pioneer Intermediate, Inc. (together with the Company, the Parent Guarantors\u201d) and the lenders party thereto, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as administrative agent in respect of the U.S. Facility (as defined below) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Canadian Branch as administrative agent in respect of the Canadian Facility (as defined below) (the senior secured revolving credit facilities provided thereunder, the Senior Secured Credit Facility\u201d). The Credit Agreement amended and restated the prior credit agreement in its entirety. The Senior Secured Credit Facility will mature on May 4, 2020.\n\ufeff\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facility originally consisted of a (i) senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million made available to the U.S. Borrower (the U.S. Facility\u201d), of which up to $5.0 million may be made available for letters of credit and up to $5.0 million may be made available for swingline loans and (ii) senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million made available to the Canadian Borrower (the Canadian Facility\u201d).\n\ufeff\nWe entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement on August 31, 2017, which increased the loan commitment available to the U.S. Borrower to $50.0 million from $25.0 million under the U.S. Facility. The loan commitment available under the Canadian Facility remained at $25.0 million. On February 16, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement and, on October 9, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement, each of which amended certain negative covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2018, we had $20.0 million in outstanding indebtedness under the U.S. Facility and no outstanding indebtedness under the Canadian Facility.\n\ufeff\nBorrowings under the U.S. Facility may be made in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars or Euros and bear interest at a rate equal to the Adjusted Base Rate or Eurocurrency Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), in each case, plus an applicable interest margin as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Canadian Facility may be made in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars and bear interest at the Canadian (Cdn) Base Rate, Canadian (U.S.) Base Rate, Eurocurrency Rate or Discount Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), in each case, plus an applicable interest margin as set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Adjusted Base Rate, Canadian (U.S.) Base Rate and Canadian (Cdn) Base Rate applicable margin will be between 2.25% and 3.00% and Eurocurrency Rate applicable margin will be between 3.25% and 4.00%, in each case, depending on the Company's leverage ratio. The applicable interest rate at December 31, 2018 was 5.88%.\n\ufeff\nThe obligations of the U.S. Borrower under the U.S. Facility are guaranteed by the Parent Guarantors and each of the other existing and future direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries of the Company organized under the laws of the United States (subject to certain exceptions) and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Parent Guarantors, the U.S. Borrower and such other subsidiary guarantors, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens. The obligations of the Canadian Borrower under the Canadian Facility are guaranteed by the Parent Guarantors, the U.S. Borrower and each of the future direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries of the Company organized under the laws of the United States and Canada (subject to certain exceptions) and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Parent Guarantors, the U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower and such subsidiary guarantors, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens.\n\ufeff\nThe Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require (i) commencing with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017, compliance with a leverage ratio test set at (A) 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending prior to March 31, 2018 and (B) 2.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending on or after March 31, 2018, (ii) commencing with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017, compliance with an interest coverage ratio test set at 2.75 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, (iii) if the leverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter is greater than 2.00 to 1.00 and the amount outstanding under the Canadian Facility at any time during such fiscal quarter was greater than $0, compliance as of the end of such fiscal quarter with a Canadian asset coverage ratio test set at 1.00 to 1.00 and (iv) if the leverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter is greater than 2.00 to 1.00 and the amount outstanding under the U.S. Facility at any time during such fiscal quarter was greater than $0, compliance as of the end of such fiscal quarter with a U.S. asset coverage ratio test set at 1.00 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. The Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on the creation of liens, the incurrence of indebtedness, investments, dividends and other restricted payments, dispositions and transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default for facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable). If an event of default occurs, the lenders under each of the U.S. Facility and the Canadian Facility may elect (after the expiration of any applicable notice or grace periods) to declare all outstanding borrowings under such facility, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under each of the U.S. Facility and the Canadian Facility also have the right upon an event of default thereunder to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings under such facility. Further, following an event of default under each of the U.S. Facility and the Canadian Facility, the lenders thereunder will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such facility.\n\ufeff\nContractual Obligations\n\ufeff\nThe following table presents our contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n_______________\n (1) The 2017 Tax Act includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result, all previously unremitted earnings for which no U.S. deferred tax liability had been accrued have now been subject to U.S. tax. The income tax payable related to the 2017 Tax Act is due in installments in varying percentages over the next seven years. \n\ufeff\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\ufeff\nWe have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements with the exception of operating leases.\n\ufeff\nEffects of Inflation\n\ufeff\nWe do not believe that the effects of inflation have had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, if our costs become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to offset such increased costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to offset any such cost increases in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\ufeff\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. The accounting policies that we believe to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and that require the most complex and subjective management judgments are discussed below.\n\ufeff\nRevenue Recognition\n\ufeff\nWe derive our revenues primarily from highly engineered products and support services. Revenues are based upon a purchase order, contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer that includes a fixed or determinable price, provided that collectability is reasonably assured, but such arrangements do not generally include right of return or other similar provisions or other significant post-delivery obligations. Sales and value added taxes that we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (i) identify the contract, (ii) identify the performance obligations, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price and (v) satisfy the performance obligation. No single customer individually accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue during the year ended 2018. One customer accounted for 12% of our trade receivable accounts balance as of December 31, 2018, with the majority of the balance collected in January 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized revenue from our largest customer totaling $27.4 million, or 14% of total revenue for the year. Amounts due from this customer included in trade accounts receivable was $2.0 million, or 4% of trade accounts receivable, as of December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the same customer accounted for $25.5 million, or approximately 26% of total revenue, and as of December 31, 2016, $7.8 million in trade accounts receivable were due from this customer, or 24% of trade accounts receivable. No other customer individually accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue during 2017 and 2016 or trade receivable accounts balance as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\n\ufeff\nOn occasion, we issue credits to our customers that are related specifically to the performance of our products or the services we provide, with such credits reducing the amount of revenue for that sale or job. Such credits are infrequent, situation-specific and cannot be estimated in advance.\n\ufeff\nThe payment terms and conditions in our customer contracts vary. We do not have contracts that contain a financing component and do not accept noncash consideration from customers.\n\ufeff\nNCS has elected to recognize shipping and handling costs when the control of the product transfers to the customer. These costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\ufeff\nProduct Sales Revenues\n\ufeff\nFor product sale arrangements that are standard inventory products or modified inventory products with an alternative use, revenue is recognized at a point in time when control transfers. Control generally transfers upon shipment or delivery, and delivery is based on the customer instructions. Customers may also request bill and hold arrangements in writing. Once we have completed the bill and hold order, the products are segregated from the rest of inventory in the warehouse. The transaction price for product sales having a performance obligation is the price per unit times the unit quantity ordered and shipped to the customer or consumed at the well site.\n\ufeff\nServices Revenue\n\ufeff\nFor service arrangements that do not have a contract provision with a right to a payment for services up to the date of termination, revenue is recognized when the job has been completed, which usually includes a customer signature or acknowledgement and when there are no additional services or future obligations required by us. The transaction price is determined by the contract unit day rate times the cumulative number of days of service provided upon the completion of the service and upon customer acceptance.\n\ufeff\nFor service arrangements that do have a contract provision with a right to payment for services up to the date of termination, revenue is recognized over time using a unit rate (labor and materials) output method that corresponds to the value we would receive upon termination of the contract at a reporting period. In applying the output method at the end of a quarter, we check that there is no material work in progress that is not in the measurement of the output. The transaction price for the period end is determined by the contract unit rate times the cumulative number of units earned up to the reporting period less any revenue recognized in prior periods.\n\ufeff\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\ufeff\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Earnings are charged with a provision for doubtful accounts based on a current review of the collectability of customer accounts by management. Such allowances are based upon several factors including, but not limited to, credit approval practices, industry and customer historical experience as well as the current and projected financial condition of the specific customer. Accounts deemed uncollectible are applied against the allowance for doubtful accounts. We have recorded $0.3 million and $11 thousand in provisions for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\ufeff\nInventories\n\ufeff\nInventories consist primarily of raw material, sliding sleeve components, assembled sliding sleeves, certain components used to internally construct our frac isolation assemblies, assembled well construction products and components, composite plugs and components and chemicals, in raw material or finished goods, used for frac diagnostics testing and reporting. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost is determined at standard costs approximating the first-in first-out basis with the exception of chemical costs, which are determined using average costing. We continuously evaluate inventories, based on an analysis of inventory levels, historical sales experience and future sales forecasts, to determine obsolete, slow-moving and excess inventory. Adjustments to reduce such inventory to its estimated recoverable value have been recorded by management as an adjustment to cost of sales.\n\ufeff\nImpairments\n\ufeff\nWe evaluate our property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability based on undiscounted future net cash flows. Should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value. Estimating future net cash flows requires us to make judgements regarding long-term forecasts of future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. These forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about our revenue growth, operating margins, capital expenditures, future market conditions and technological developments. If changes in these assumptions occur, our expectations regarding future net cash flows may change such that a material impairment could result. As a result of unfavorable oil and gas industry market conditions in late 2018 that have continued to persist into early 2019 and the related impact on expected customer activity levels, particularly in Canada, as well as a decline in the quoted price of our common stock, we determined that the carrying values of certain long-lived assets in one of our asset groups were no longer recoverable, which resulted in an impairment charge of $73.5 million related to identifiable intangible assets, which we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. There was no impairment related to fixed assets in 2018. No fixed asset or finite-lived intangible impairments were recorded in 2017 or 2016. See Note 7. Goodwill and Intangibles\u201d of our consolidated financial statements for additional detail related to these charges.\n\ufeff\nAn assessment for goodwill impairment is performed annually or when there is an indication an impairment may have occurred. We typically complete our annual impairment test for goodwill using an assessment date in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets (including allocated goodwill) to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a combination of a market multiple and a discounted cash flow approach. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of estimates, assumptions and judgement. The principal estimates and assumptions that we use include revenue growth, operating margins, capital expenditures, future market conditions, weighted average costs of capital, a terminal growth rate, the set of comparable companies utilized, and the earnings metrics and multiples utilized. We believe that the estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments are reasonable. If the reporting unit's carrying value is greater than its calculated fair value, we recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its calculated fair value. At December 31, 2018, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test on each of our three reporting units and as a result of unfavorable oil and gas industry market conditions in late 2018 that have continued to persist into early 2019 and the related impact on expected customer activity levels, particularly in Canada, as well as a decline in the quoted price of our common stock, we concluded that there had been an impairment because the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair values for two reporting units, which resulted in an impairment charge of $154.0 million. No impairments were recorded in 2017 or 2016. See Note 7. Goodwill and Intangibles\u201d of our consolidated financial statements for additional detail related to these charges.\n\ufeff\nProperty and Equipment\n\ufeff\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Equipment held under capital leases are stated at the present value of minimum lease payments. Expenditures for property and equipment and for items which substantially increase the useful lives of existing assets are capitalized at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful life utilizing the straight-line method. Routine expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements and property under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the remaining lease term or useful life of the related asset. Depreciation expense includes amortization of assets under capital leases. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are recognized in other (expense) income, net in the year of disposal.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation on property and equipment, including assets held under capital leases, is calculated using the straight-line method over the following useful service lives or lease term (which includes reasonably assured renewal periods):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\ufeff\nBusiness combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 805, Business Combinations. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total consideration transferred in connection with the acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree based on their fair values. Goodwill acquired in connection with business combinations represents the excess of consideration transferred over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Certain assumptions and estimates are employed in evaluating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These estimates may be affected by factors such as changing market conditions, technological advances in the oil and natural gas industry or changes in regulations governing that industry. The most significant assumptions requiring judgment involve identifying and estimating the fair value of intangible assets and the associated useful lives for establishing amortization periods. To finalize purchase accounting for significant acquisitions, we utilize the services of independent valuation specialists to assist in the determination of the fair value of acquired intangible assets.\n\ufeff\nCosts related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issuance of debt or equity securities, that we incur in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.\n\ufeff\nAny contingent consideration payable is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Liability-classified contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until the contingent consideration is settled.\n\ufeff\nAll identifiable intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life or term of related agreements. Deferred loan costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method. Certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software applications are capitalized and costs incurred outside of the software application development stage are expensed as incurred. The amounts capitalized are included in intangibles, categorized as internally developed software, and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software when it is ready for its intended use. These assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\ufeff\nIncome Taxes\n\ufeff\nWe are taxed as a corporation as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. The liability method is used in accounting for deferred income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. The realizability of deferred tax assets is evaluated annually and a valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not give rise to future benefits. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, based upon technical merits, upon examination by the taxing authorities. If the income tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria, the benefit recorded in the consolidated financial statements equals the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon its ultimate settlement. A valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the valuation allowance was $1.1 million and $18 thousand, respectively. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in other income (expense). During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in interest and penalties. We had $0.6 million and $0.6 million in interest and penalties accrued at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\ufeff\nOne of our Canadian subsidiaries guaranteed the credit facilities of our U.S. entities until May 2017 when cash proceeds were received from the IPO, a portion of which was used to pay off the existing debt. Under U.S. federal income tax rules, this guarantee resulted in all of the earnings and profits of our Canadian subsidiary being subject to current U.S. tax. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act and a change in our permanent earnings reinvestment assertion, we have recognized a U.S. tax benefit for the reversal of our deferred\ntax liability on a portion of our differences between book value and tax basis in our Canadian subsidiary for which we are now asserting indefinite reinvestment. No U.S. deferred tax liabilities have been recognized on the differences between book value and tax basis that we continue to indefinitely reinvest. Upon reversal of these book value and tax basis differences through dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to foreign withholding taxes. It is not practical, however, to estimate the amount of taxes that may be payable on the eventual remittance of these temporary differences after consideration of available foreign tax credits.\n\ufeff\nWe completed our analysis of our tax positions and believe there are no material uncertain tax positions that would require derecognition in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. We believe that there are no tax positions taken or expected to be taken that would significantly increase or decrease unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months following the balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no material amounts that had been accrued with respect to uncertain tax positions.\n\ufeff\nNo valuation allowances have been provided for the $9.3 million U.S. deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2018. The Company believes it is more likely than not to realize the benefit of this asset. The Company has historically been a U.S. taxpayer and projects future operations will generate sufficient taxable income. However, in the event the Company has a change in circumstances which would change management's judgment regarding the ability to generate sufficient U.S. taxable income, a valuation allowance would be recorded against the U.S. deferred tax asset.\n\ufeff\nWe file income tax returns in the United States, Canada and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Our U.S. income tax returns for 2011 and subsequent years remain open for examination. The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) commenced an examination of our United States income tax returns for 2011 through 2012 in the first quarter of 2014 which was completed in 2015. No tax adjustments were proposed. Additionally, subsequent to December 31, 2015, the IRS commenced an examination of our United States income tax return for 2014 in the second quarter of 2016, which was completed in 2017. No tax adjustments were proposed. During 2018, the Canada Revenue Agency ( CRA\u201d) commenced an examination of our transfer pricing on Canadian income tax returns for the 2012 through 2015 filings and no tax adjustments have been proposed.\n\ufeff\nShare-Based Compensation\n\ufeff\nWe account for our stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation- Stock Compensation ( ASC 718\u201d). We recognize compensation cost for all share-based payment transactions, including compensation cost associated with the grant of options, RSUs and PSUs for our common stock using the Black-Scholes model for options, the market price of the common stock on the date of the grant for the RSUs and a Monte Carlo simulation for the PSUs. Expense is recognized ratably from one to five years based upon the requisite service period. We also have an ESPP, which allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of the stock price at the beginning or end of the offering period. The fair value of the employees' purchase rights under the ESPP is estimated using the Black-Scholes model. For additional information, see Note 12. Share-Based Compensation\u201d of our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\ufeff\nSee Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of the accounting pronouncements we recently adopted and the accounting pronouncements recently issued by the FASB.\n\ufeff\nEmerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status\n\ufeff\nWe are an emerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act\u201d). We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of our fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. Additionally, we are also a smaller reporting company\u201d as defined by Section 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act\u201d), meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $250 million. As an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, we may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies that do not qualify for those classifications.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff", "item_7_tables": "Table 164: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

services for oil and gas well completions and field development strategies. It operates primarily in North America.\n\n- Revenue comes mainly from sales of fracturing systems products and related services. Additional revenue comes from sales of other well construction products and tracer diagnostics services.\n\n2018 Performance\n- Total revenue was $227.0 million, up 12.6% from 2017, driven by increased sales of well construction products and contributions from acquisitions. This was partially offset by reduced sales of fracturing systems.\n\n- Net loss was $185.2 million compared to net income of $1.3 million in 2017. The loss was due to $227.5 million in non-cash impairment charges related to intangible assets and goodwill resulting from industry conditions and stock price decline. \n\n- Adjusted EBITDA provides an important view of operating performance by excluding non-cash and other one-time items.\n\nIndustry Trends\n- North American drilling and completion activity increased from 2016-2018 but is expected be lower in 2019. Customers are focused more on returns and free cash flow rather than production growth.\n\n- NCS expects 2019 customer activity to decline slightly in U.S. and significantly in Canada due to low commodity prices, differentials, and production curtailments.\n\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\n- Primary sources of liquidity are $25.1 million of cash, cash from operations, and $55 million of availability under a senior credit facility.  \n\n- Plan $9-13 million of capital expenditures in 2019 to support operations and growth initiatives. Believe existing resources are sufficient to fund needs.\n\nSo in summary, while 2018 performance grew versus prior year, impairment charges led to a net loss. Industry headwinds are expected in 2019 but the company believes it has adequate liquidity."}
