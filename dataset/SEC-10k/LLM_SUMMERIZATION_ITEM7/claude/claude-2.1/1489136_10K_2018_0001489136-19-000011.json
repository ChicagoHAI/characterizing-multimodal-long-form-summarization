Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe, and our significant equity method investee, own gathering systems, transportation pipelines, crude oil transport trucks, processing plants, storage facilities and terminals in Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming and in Alberta, Canada.\nGeneral Trends and Outlook\nThe prices of crude oil and natural gas have historically been volatile. For example, from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2018, the NYMEX prompt month settle price ranged from a high of $107.26 per barrel to a low of $26.21 per barrel. The range for natural gas during that period was $6.15 to $1.64 per MMBtu. Substantial declines in crude oil and natural gas prices, particularly prolonged declines, can have negative effects on producers including:\n\u2022reduced revenue, operating income and cash flows;\n\u2022reduced volume of crude oil and natural gas that can be produced economically;\n\u2022delayed or postponed capital projects; and/or\n\u2022limited access to or increased cost of capital, such as equity and long-term debt.\nThe substantial declines in crude oil and natural gas prices since mid-2014 and continuing throughout 2018 have had these effects on a number of companies in the oil and gas industry, including our customers. While we do not have significant direct exposure to commodity prices, we are exposed to a reduction in volumes to be transported, stored, gathered, processed and marketed as a result of lower prices. Additionally, changes to price differentials between basins also impact our crude oil marketing operations. We were impacted by these factors in 2018 and expect them to continue in 2019.\nWe continue to execute on our de-leveraging strategy. We have pre-funded capital growth projects and reduced debt leverage through the issuance of subsidiary preferred equity representing a 49% interest in Maurepas Pipeline for $350 million in November of 2018 and our 2019 contribution of our Canadian business to a joint venture with KKR which returned $484 million of cash to SemGroup. We own a 51% interest in the joint venture which subsequently acquired Meritage Midstream ULC and its midstream infrastructure assets for approximately $490 million. The transaction closed on February 25, 2019.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance. We view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and review these measurements on at least a monthly basis for consistency and trend analysis. These metrics include financial measures such as operating expenses, Segment Profit and Adjusted EBITDA and operating data including contracted storage capacity and sales, transportation and processing volumes.\nOperating Expenses\nOur management seeks to maximize the profitability of our operations, in part, by minimizing operating expenses. These expenses are comprised of salary and wage expense, utility costs, insurance premiums, taxes and other operating costs, some of which are independent of the volumes we handle.\nSegment Profit\nOur management analyzes the performance of our operating segments through our segment profit measure which is defined as revenue, less cost of products sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and operating expenses, plus equity earnings and is adjusted to remove unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and to reflect equity earnings on an EBITDA basis. Reflecting equity earnings on an EBITDA basis is achieved by adjusting equity earnings to exclude our percentage of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from equity earnings for operated equity method investees. For our investment in NGL Energy, we exclude equity earnings and include cash distributions received.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization and adjusted for selected items that we believe impact the comparability of financial results between reporting periods. In addition to non-cash items, we have selected items for adjustment to EBITDA which management feels decrease the comparability of our results among periods. These items are identified as those which are generally outside of the results of day-to-day operations of the business. These items are not considered non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, but do erode comparability among periods in which they occur with periods in which they do not occur or occur to a greater or lesser degree.\nHistorically, we have selected items such as gains on the sale of NGL Energy common units, costs related to our predecessor's bankruptcy, significant business development related costs, significant legal settlements, severance and other similar costs. Management believes these types of items can make comparability of the results of day to day operations among periods difficult and have chosen to remove these items from our Adjusted EBITDA. We expect to adjust for similar types of items in the future. Although we present selected items that we consider in evaluating our performance, you should be aware that the items presented do not represent all items that affect comparability between the periods presented. Variations in our operating results are also caused by changes in volumes, prices, mechanical interruptions and numerous other factors. We do not adjust for these types of variances.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to assess:\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our operating performance as compared to that of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis, capital structure or the impact of fluctuating commodity prices; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Note About Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations.\nNet income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing the utility.\nManagement compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable GAAP measure, understanding the difference between Adjusted EBITDA and net income (loss) and incorporating this knowledge into its decision-making processes. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a historical basis for each of the periods indicated.\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

</tr>\n</table>\nBusiness and Performance Drivers\nWe operate our core businesses through three business segments: U.S. Liquids, U.S. Gas and Canada. We generate revenue in these segments by using our assets to provide products and services to third parties and by selectively using our assets to support our marketing activities.\nCertain factors are key to our operations. These include the safe, reliable and efficient operation of the pipelines and facilities that we own and operate, while meeting the regulations that govern the operation of our assets and the costs associated with such regulations.\nRevenue\nOur revenue is generated through the gathering, transportation, processing and storage of petroleum products. Our customers pay us fees based on volumes gathered, transported, processed and stored. We also generate revenue by marketing petroleum products.\nWe may use futures, swaps and options contracts to manage our exposure to market changes in commodity prices, to protect our gross margins on our purchased petroleum products and to manage our liquidity risk associated with margin deposit requirements on our overall derivative positions. When purchasing petroleum products, we seek to manage our exposure to commodity price risk. As we purchase inventory from suppliers, we may establish a fixed or variable margin with future sales using one of the following methods:\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>we have already sold that product for physical delivery pursuant to sales contracts at a market index price,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>we sell the product for future physical delivery pursuant to effectively back-to-back sales contracts, or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>we enter into futures and swaps contracts on the NYMEX or over the counter markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition, we may purchase put options or derivatives other than futures or swaps to hedge our inventory of petroleum products prior to our sale of such inventory.\nVolumes\nGenerally, we expect revenue to increase or decrease in conjunction with increases or decreases in total volumes. Our total volumes are affected by various factors, including our physical storage or transportation capacity, our working capital and credit availability under our credit facilities to support petroleum product purchases and the availability of the supply of petroleum product available for purchase, which is determined based primarily upon producer activity in areas near our asset base.\nCommodity Prices\nOur business is primarily fee based. As a result, our financial results are typically not directly correlated with increases and decreases in commodity prices. Our financial results, however, are positively correlated with the absolute difference between current (prompt) and future month petroleum product prices. That is, wide contango (when the prices for future deliveries are higher than current prices) spreads generally have a favorable impact on our results relative to a slightly contango, flat or backwardated (when the prices for future deliveries are lower than current prices) market. While we do not have significant direct exposure to commodity prices, we are exposed to reductions in volumes transported, stored, gathered, processed and marketed as a result of lower prices. Additionally, changes to price differentials between basins also impact our crude oil marketing operations.\nTiming of Purchase and Sales\nOur financial results are affected by the timing of the purchase and sale of petroleum products, such that financial results may not be comparable between periods. When we enter into an arrangement to purchase product, place the product in storage and resell the product in the future, our financial results do not reflect any related margin until the settlement of the product sale. Prior to the settlement of the product sale, our results reflect the cost of the product in our inventory. Differences in the timing of our product purchases and sales, especially if they extend over fiscal years or quarters, may result in sizable differences between our results over the comparable period.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

operating expenses\nRevenue, costs of products sold and operating expenses are analyzed by operating segment below.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased in 2018 to $91.6 million from $113.8 million in 2017. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in acquisition related costs, the disposition of our U.K. and Mexican businesses in early 2018 and full year of expense related to our HFOTCO acquisition, which was acquired in July of 2017. Current year acquisition related costs are $2.7 million compared with $22.0 million in the prior year, primarily due to the HFOTCO acquisition. Our U.K. and Mexican businesses incurred a combined $4.1 million of general and administrative expense in the current year prior to their disposals compared with a combined $16.0 million in the prior year. The decreases in general and administrative expense were offset by an increase of $7.8 million from the prior year for the HFOTCO business as a result of a full year of operations in 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased in 2017 to $113.8 million from $84.2 million in 2016 primarily due to $26 million of HFOTCO related costs, of which $22 million were acquisition related costs. General and administrative costs for Canada increased by $3 million compared to prior year primarily due to employment costs, office costs and an increase in foreign exchange rates between periods.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization costs increased in 2018 to $209.3 million from $158.4 million in 2017, primarily due to a full year of depreciation and amortization from the HFOTCO acquisition and the Maurepas Pipeline which was placed in service in 2017 and other projects placed in-service during the period, partially offset by the disposition of our U.K. and Mexican businesses. The increase due to HFOTCO was $38.0 million, the increase due to the Maurepas Pipeline was $14.9 million and the decrease due to the U.K. and Mexican business dispositions was $11.7 million.\nDepreciation and amortization costs increased in 2017 to $158.4 million from $98.8 million in 2016, of which $44 million related to the HFOTCO assets including finite-lived intangible assets acquired in July 2017. The Maurepas Pipeline which was placed in service in 2017 accounted for $11 million of the increase. The remaining increase relates to smaller projects placed in-service during the period.\nLoss (gain) on disposal or impairment, net\nIn 2018 we had a net gain on disposal or impairment of $3.6 million. The net gain was primarily a result of small gains due to the finalization of the sales of our U.K. and Mexican businesses and a post-closing adjustment of $1.4 million related to the disposal of Glass Mountain in 2017.\nLoss on disposal or impairment, net in 2017 was $13.3 million. The net loss on disposal or impairment in 2017 was due to the following (in thousands):\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Segment\n</td> <td>Loss/(Gain)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Write-down Mexican asphalt business to net realizable value\n</td> <td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Write-down U.K. operations to net realizable value\n</td> <td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>76,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sherman natural gas gathering and processing asset impairment\n</td> <td>U.S. Gas\n</td> <td>30,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil trucking goodwill impairment\n</td> <td>U.S. Liquids\n</td> <td>26,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil trucking intangible asset impairment\n</td> <td>U.S. Liquids\n</td> <td>12,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of Glass Mountain\n</td> <td>U.S. Liquids\n</td> <td>(150,266\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on disposal or impairment, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe write-downs of the Mexican asphalt business and the U.K. operations to net realizable value was due to the businesses being categorized as held-for-sale at December 31, 2017.\nThe impairment of our Sherman, Texas natural gas gathering and processing assets was due to the evaluation of capital raising alternatives which indicated that the carrying value of our Sherman, Texas assets might be in excess of fair value. We used an income approach, based on a discounted cash flow model, to estimate the fair value of the assets, which resulted in a non-cash impairment.\nThe impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of our crude oil trucking business was due to a reduction in the long range forecast for crude oil trucking due to the on-going challenging business environment. We viewed the decrease in the forecast as a triggering event that indicated a potential impairment and performed an interim impairment analysis on the business unit's assets including goodwill and intangible assets.\nWe performed a recoverability test of our definite lived assets under ASC 360 whereby we compared the undiscounted cash flows of the asset group, which was determined to be the entire crude oil trucking reporting unit and included goodwill, to the carrying value of the assets at September 30, 2017. This test indicated that the assets were not fully recoverable. Therefore, we estimated the fair value of the definite lived assets using an income approach, supplemented by a market approach to measure impairment. We also performed an interim impairment test of our goodwill associated with the crude oil trucking reporting unit and determined the estimated fair value was less than the adjusted carrying value of the reporting unit resulting in impairment of goodwill. The cash flow models used to determine recoverability of our assets and to measure impairment expense involved using significant judgments and assumptions, which included the discount rate, anticipated revenue and volume growth rates, estimated operating expenses and capital expenditures, which were based on our operating and capital budgets as well as our strategic plans. We considered the market approach by comparing the revenue and earnings multiples implied by our income approach to those of comparable companies for reasonableness and for estimating the fair value of certain assets of our reporting unit.\nThe gain on the sale of Glass Mountain is due to the December 22, 2017 sale of our ownership interest in Glass Mountain for $300 million, subject to working capital and other adjustments.\nLoss on disposal or impairment, net in 2016 was primarily due to a $13.1 million impairment of U.S. Gas goodwill as a result of producer forecast reductions following the release of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission's Regional Earthquake Response Plan which curtailed the amount of volume that can be injected into disposal wells.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased in 2018 to $149.7 million from $103.0 million in 2017. The increase is primarily the result of a net increase of $15.2 million related to the $300 million, 7.25% senior unsecured notes sold in September 2017, the $325 million, 6.375% senior unsecured notes sold in March 2017, and the early payoff of $300 million, 7.50% senior unsecured notes sold in March 2017. There was a $22.1 million increase in HFOTCO bank interest due to a full year of interest in 2018 compared to only six months interest in 2017. These net increases were offset by a net decrease in capitalized interest of $5.8 million due to fewer U.S. projects in 2018 and the initial on-line operations of the Maurepas Pipeline, offset slightly by increased projects in Canada.\nInterest increased in 2017 to $103.0 million from $62.7 million in 2016. The increase is primarily the result of $28.4 million related to HFOTCO debt subsequent to acquisition including accretion of the final payment, $22.8 million attributable to the new $325 million, 6.375% senior unsecured notes sold in March 2017 and the $300 million, 7.25% senior unsecured notes sold in September 2017 and $8.6 million due to increased borrowings on SemGroup's revolving credit facility. These increases were offset by a $17.8 million decrease in interest expense due to the early payoff of $300 million, 7.50% senior unsecured notes in March 2017.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased $290 million of our outstanding $300 million senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the 2021 Notes\u201d) through a tender offer. The price included a premium and interest to the purchase date. A notice of redemption was issued for the remaining $10 million of 2021 Notes, which were not redeemed through the tender offer pursuant to the redemption and satisfaction and discharge provisions of the indenture governing the 2021 Notes. The redemption price includes a redemption premium and interest to the redemption date. As a result, we recognized a loss of $19.9 million on the early extinguishment of the 2021 Notes, which included premiums of $15.9 million and the write off of $3.6 million of associated unamortized debt issuance costs.\nForeign currency transaction loss (gain)\nForeign currency transaction changed to a loss of $9.5 million in 2018 from a gain of $4.7 million in 2017. The change is primarily due to realized and unrealized losses of $10.2 million on foreign currency forwards for purchases of Canadian dollars to limit exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations for capital contributions to our Canadian operations compared with $2.8 million of realized and unrealized gains in the prior year. The remaining change is primarily due to foreign currency changes related to U.S. dollar denominated payables of our U.K. business which was sold in early 2018.\nForeign currency transaction changed to a gain of $4.7 million in 2017 from a loss of $4.8 million in 2016. The change is primarily due to changes in the foreign currency rates and amounts of U.S. dollar denominated payables of our U.K. business compared to the prior year and $2.8 million of realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency forwards entered into in the fourth quarter of 2017. The forwards are for purchases of Canadian dollars to limit exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations for capital contributions to our Canadian operations.\nLoss on sale or impairment of non-operated equity method investment\nIn 2016, we incurred a $30.6 million loss due to a $39.8 million other-than-temporary impairment recorded on our NGL Energy common units, partially offset by a $9.1 million gain on the sale of remaining NGL Energy common units in 2016.\nResults of Operations by Reporting Segment\nU.S. Liquids\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,680,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,299,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>716,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pipeline transportation\n</td> <td>84,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Truck transportation\n</td> <td>23,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Storage fees\n</td> <td>161,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility service fees\n</td> <td>49,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease revenue\n</td> <td>17,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>2,017,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,493,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>827,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of products sold\n</td> <td>1,646,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,259,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>652,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expense\n</td> <td>134,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gain (loss) on commodity derivatives, net\n</td> <td>5,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(989\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from equity method investments\n</td> <td>57,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to reflect equity earnings on an EBITDA basis\n</td> <td>19,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>229,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross product sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,357,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,616,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,118,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonmonetary transaction adjustment\n</td> <td>(3,681,827\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,317,421\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,401,200\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gain (loss) on commodity derivatives, net\n</td> <td>5,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(989\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,680,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,299,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>716,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 versus 2017\nRevenues\nProduct sales increased in 2018 to $1.7 billion from $1.3 billion in 2017.\nGross product revenue increased in 2018 to $5.4 billion from $4.6 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the average sales price to $65 per barrel in 2018, from an average sales price of $50 per barrel in 2017, partially offset by a decrease in the volume sold to 83 million barrels in 2018 from 92 million barrels in 2017. Volumes decreased as compared to prior year due to fewer location trades.\nGross product revenue was reduced by $3.7 billion and $3.3 billion during 2018 and 2017, respectively, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 845-10-15, \"Nonmonetary Transactions,\" (\"ASC 845-10-15\"). ASC 845-10-15 requires that certain transactions -- those where inventory is purchased from a customer then resold to the same customer -- to be presented in the income statement on a net basis, resulting in a reduction of revenue and costs of products sold by the same amount.\nPipeline transportation revenue increased to $84.9 million in 2018 from $43.6 million in 2017, primarily due to an increase of $37.9 million, as a result of a full year of operations on the Maurepas Pipeline, and a $3.5 million increase on the WOT due to higher transportation volumes.\nTruck transportation revenue decreased to $23.6 million in 2018 from $31.4 million in 2017, due to lower transportation volumes.\nStorage revenue increased to $161.5 million in 2018 from $85.7 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $78.1 million reflecting a full year of HFOTCO operations, partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in crude storage compared to prior year, as the average capacity leased by storage customers decreased to 5.9 million barrels from 6.3 million barrels.\nFacility service fees increased to $49.9 million in 2018 from $27.7 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $26.2 million reflecting a full year of HFOTCO operations, partially offset by a $4.6 million decrease at Platteville as a result of lower truck unloading volumes.\nLease revenue increased to $17.5 million in 2018 from $5.8 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to a full year of HFOTCO operations.\nCost of Products Sold\nCosts of products sold increased in 2018 to $1.7 billion from $1.3 billion in 2017. The cost of products sold reflect reductions of $3.7 billion and $3.3 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively, in accordance with ASC 845-10-15. There was a decrease in the barrels sold, as described above, combined with an increase in the average per barrel cost of crude oil to $65 in 2018 from $50 in 2017.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2018 to $134.2 million from $99.3 million in 2017 due to a $35.9 million increase at HFOTCO reflecting a full year of operations, as well as other increases in insurance and taxes and maintenance and repair expense, partially offset by a decrease in outside services.\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Commodity Derivatives, net\nUnrealized gain (loss) on commodity derivatives, net increased in 2018 to a gain of $5.1 million from a loss of $40.0 thousand in 2017. The gain is due to open positions and changes in market prices in the current year.\nEarnings from Equity Method Investments\nEarnings from equity method investments decreased in 2018 to $57.6 million from $67.3 million in 2017. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of Glass Mountain and decreased earnings by White Cliffs of $7.5 million and $2.2 million, respectively.\n2017 versus 2016\nRevenue\nProduct sales increased in 2017 to $1.3 billion from $716.6 million in 2016.\nGross product revenue increased in 2017 to $4.6 billion from $3.1 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the volume sold to 92 million barrels at an average sales price of $50 per barrel in 2017, from the volume sold of 75 million barrels at an average sales price of $42 per barrel in 2016. Volumes increased as compared to prior year due to additional location trades.\nGross product revenue was reduced by $3.3 billion and $2.4 billion during 2017 and 2016, respectively, in accordance with ASC 845-10-15.\nPipeline transportation revenue increased to $43.6 million in 2017 from $23.1 million in 2016. The increase was primarily the result of $20.8 million related to the start-up of the Maurepas Pipeline and a $3.7 million increase on the WOT. These increases were partially offset by a $3.6 million reduction related to the Tampa Pipeline, that was sold in the first quarter of 2017.\nTruck transportation revenue decreased to $31.4 million in 2017 from $41.8 million in 2016, primarily as a result of slightly lower volumes and rates.\nStorage fee revenue increased in 2017 to $85.7 million from $27.7 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to the 2017 acquisition of HFOTCO resulting in $60.5 million of revenue, offset by a reduction in crude oil storage revenue of\n$2.2 million, mainly resulting from scheduled tank cleanings, as the average capacity leased by storage customers decreased to 6.2 million barrels from 6.6 million barrels. The remainder is due to decreases in pump-over revenue of $0.7 million, third-party unloading revenue of $0.3 million and other revenue of $0.2 million.\nFacility service fees increased to $27.7 million in 2017 from $18.3 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $10.6 million reflecting the 2017 acquisition of HFOTCO, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease at Platteville as a result of lower truck unloading volumes.\nCosts of Products Sold\nCosts of products sold increased in 2017 to $1.3 billion from $652.4 million in 2016. The cost of products sold reflects reductions of $3.3 billion and $2.4 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively, in accordance with ASC 845-10-15. There was an increase in the barrels sold, as described above, combined with an increase in the average per barrel cost of crude oil to $50 in 2017 from $41 in 2016.\nThe increase in cost of products sold outpaced the increase in revenue leading to a decrease in segment profit of $31.8 million as compared to the prior year. This is primarily due to lower blending margins of $8.2 million due to increased competition at Cushing, lower contango margins of $5.8 million, increased pipeline transportation fees of $8.2 million related to firm commitments beginning in June 2017 and increased truck transportation fees of $7.3 million related to increased volume.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2017 to $99.3 million from $82.8 million in 2016 due to a $15.3 million increase as a result of the acquisition of HFOTCO during 2017.\nU.S. Gas\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service fees\n</td> <td>54,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>265,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>233,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>218,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>165,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expense\n</td> <td>32,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 versus 2017\nRevenues\nRevenues increased in 2018 to $265.3 million from $233.2 million in 2017. The increase is primarily due to higher volumes (134,135 MMcf in 2018 compared to 101,709 MMcf for 2017) and higher average NGL basket price of $0.86/gallon in 2018 versus $0.85/gallon in 2017. The increase was partially offset by lower average natural gas NYMEX price of $3.09/MMbtu in 2018 versus $3.11/MMbtu in 2017. Volume increases are primarily due to Stack production, offset by reduced Mississippi Lime drilling, coupled with natural well production declines.\nGathering and processing fee revenue increased in 2018 to $54.5 million from $52.6 million in 2017. In the current year, certain fees are reported as gathering and processing fee revenue under ASU 2016-15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( ASC 606\u201d), whereas in the prior year these amounts were reported as reductions to cost of sales under ASC 605. The current year includes $15.0 million of fee revenue which would have been included as a reduction to cost of sales under the prior year methodology. Exclusive of the impact of ASC 606, fee revenue decreased by $13.1 million due lower product recovery fees and unfavorable contract mix, partially offset by higher volumes.\nCost of Products Sold\nCost of products sold increased in 2018 to $165.5 million from $135.7 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher NGL prices, the impact of ASC 606 discussed above, offset by lower Mississippi Lime volumes and lower natural gas prices.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased slightly in 2018 to $32.7 million from $29.7 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to compression overhauls, turbine maintenance, and employee costs.\n2017 versus 2016\nRevenue\nRevenue increased in 2017 to $233.2 million from $219.0 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a higher average natural gas NYMEX price of $3.108/MMbtu in 2017 versus $2.46/MMbtu in 2016, a higher average NGL basket price of $0.85/gallon in 2017 versus $0.65/gallon in 2016, and increased fees of $53 million in 2017 versus $52 million in 2016 due to higher rates. The increase was offset, in part, by lower volume (101,709 million cubic feet in 2017 versus 116,748 million cubic feet in 2016).\nCosts of Products Sold\nCosts of products sold increased in 2017 to $135.7 million from $120.5 million in 2016. The increase was attributable to higher prices and was offset, in part, by lower volume processed in northern Oklahoma.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense decreased in 2017 to $29.7 million from $31.9 million in 2016. This decrease was due to lower equipment lease, field expense (which includes materials and supplies, lubricants, water disposal, electricity and fuel), maintenance/repair, and office expense. All decreases are primarily driven by lower volume in northern Oklahoma. These decreases were offset by increases in employment, outside services, taxes, and other expenses.\nCanada\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>59,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>193,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expense\n</td> <td>111,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 versus 2017\nRevenue\nRevenue increased in 2018 to $193.1 million from $183.2 million in 2017. This increase is primarily due to higher operating costs recoveries of $5.2 million, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between periods of $1.7 million and higher gathering and processing revenue of $1.3 million. These increases were offset, in part, by true-ups of take-or-pay minimum volumes commitments of $3.6 million. Further, a 31-day planned outage at the KA plant in 2018 decreased gathering and processing revenue by $2.2 million. This was offset by the 2017 planned outage at the K3 plant which decreased gathering and processing revenue by $2.5 million.\nAdditionally, subsequent to the adoption of ASC 606, we recognized $4.5 million of revenue, to recognize certain deficiencies on take-or-pay agreements for which there is a contractual make-up period. Under ASC 605, revenue related to\ndeficiencies with a make-up period was deferred until the contractual right to make up a deficiency expired. Under ASC 606, we can recognize all or a portion of revenue related to deficiencies before the make-up period expires if we determine that it is probable that the customer will not make-up all or some of its deficient volumes, for example if there is insufficient capacity to make up the deficient volumes in future periods.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2018 to $111.5 million from $106.8 million in 2017. This increase is primarily due to turnaround costs related to the KA plant of $25.6 million, higher power costs of $5.0 million, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates between periods of $1.4 million. These increases were offset, in part, by turnaround costs in 2017 for the K3 plant of $27.2 million.\n2017 versus 2016\nRevenue\nRevenue increased in 2017 to $183.2 million from $133.2 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to higher operating cost recoveries of $27.6 million (primarily attributable to the K3 plant turnaround), higher gathering and processing revenue of $4.7 million, non-recurring 2016 fee concessions of $4.6 million, true-up of take-or-pay minimum volumes commitments of $4.4 million and changes in foreign currency exchange rates between periods of $3.1 million.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2017 to $106.8 million from $79.8 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to turnaround costs related to the K3 plant, offset by lower contractor costs of $4.1 million.\nCorporate and Other\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of products sold\n</td> <td>10,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expense\n</td> <td>6,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from equity method investments\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to reflect NGL Energy equity earnings on a cash basis\n</td> <td>(47\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate and Other is not an operating segment. This table is included to permit the reconciliation of segment information to that of the consolidated Company. The amounts reported for the year ended December 31, 2016 above have been recast to include our former U.K. and Mexico segments which, subsequent to our acquisition of HFOTCO, were no longer expected to be significant for separate presentation. The main activities of our U.K. operations were the receipt, storage and redelivery of clean petroleum and crude oil products via sea-going vessels. Our U.K. revenue was based on fixed-fee storage tank leases and related services. Revenue from our Mexico operations was based on contractual arrangements with customers for liquid asphalt cement. Our U.K. operations and Mexico operations were sold in 2018. Earnings from equity method investments in the table above relates to our investments in NGL Energy.\n2018 versus 2017\nThe decreases in revenues, cost of products sold and operating expenses are due to the disposal of our U.K. operations and Mexican asphalt business in early 2018 compared with a full year of operations for both entities in the prior year.\n2017 versus 2016\nRevenues\nThe increase in revenue relates primarily to higher revenues in our Mexico operations ($155 million in 2017 compared to $139 million in 2016), mostly due to higher product sales prices, partially offset by slightly lower volume and foreign exchange impacts between periods. Revenue in our U.K. operations increased to $28 million in 2017 compared to $25 million in 2016, primarily as a result of increased storage volume thereby creating increased throughput revenue and storage volume and price variances. The remaining change was primarily due to an increase in the intersegment eliminations which are reported in Corporate and Other. Intersegment revenues relate to product sales from our U.S. Gas segment to our U.S. Liquids segment.\nCosts of products sold\nThe increase in costs of products sold relates primarily to higher costs in Mexico ($131 million in 2017 compared to $111 million in 2016), as a result of higher unit costs in Mexico, partially offset by lower volume.\nEarnings from Equity Method Investments\nThe decrease in earnings from equity method investments is due to the sale of our limited partner interest in NGL Energy in April of 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOur principal sources of short-term liquidity are cash generated from our operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. The consolidated cash balance on December 31, 2018 was $86.7 million. Of this amount, $17.1 million was held in Canada and may be subject to tax if transferred to the U.S. Potential sources of long-term liquidity include issuances of debt securities and equity securities and the sale of assets. Our primary cash requirements currently are operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt payments and our quarterly dividends. In general, we expect to fund:\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operating expenses, maintenance capital expenditures and cash dividends through existing cash and cash from operating activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expansion capital expenditures and any working capital deficits through cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities and the issuance of debt securities and equity securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>acquisitions through cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities, the issuance of debt securities and equity securities and proceeds from the divestiture of assets or interests in assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>debt principal payments through cash from operating activities and refinancings when the credit facility becomes due.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our ability to meet our financing requirements and fund our planned capital expenditures will depend on our future operating performance and distributions from our equity investments, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry. In addition, we are subject to conditions in the debt and equity markets for any issuances of debt securities and equity securities. There can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets in the future. If we would be unable or unwilling to access those markets, we could be required to restrict future cash outlays, such as expansion capital expenditures and potential future acquisitions.\nWe believe our cash from operations and our remaining borrowing capacity allow us to manage our day-to-day cash requirements, distribute our quarterly dividends and meet our capital expenditure commitments for the coming year.\nThe following table summarizes our changes in unrestricted cash for the periods presented:\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement of cash flow data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>269,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(229,670\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(439,801\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(228,284\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(45,004\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>315,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal\n</td> <td>(4,970\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(2,074\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,479\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(7,044\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n</td> <td>93,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe components of operating cash flows can be summarized as follows:\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24,328\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,150\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash expenses, net\n</td> <td>248,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in operating assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>45,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33,023\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,966\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>269,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 Compared to 2017\nAdjustments to net income for non-cash expenses increased to $248.2 million in 2018 from $190.6 million in 2017.

These cash outflows were offset, in part, by cash inflows of $147.8 million in proceeds from business divestitures and $19.1 million in distributions from equity method investments in excess of equity in earnings. Capital expenditures included our Canada segment's Wapiti expansion and our U.S. Liquids segment's expansion projects at our Gulf Coast terminal. Distributions in excess of equity earnings represent cash distributions from White Cliffs in excess of our cumulative equity in earnings and are accounted for as a return of investment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we had net cash outflows of $439.8 million, primarily as a result of $462.7 million in capital expenditures, $294.2 million cash paid as a portion of the first payment to acquire HFOTCO and $26.4 million in contributions to equity method investments. These cash outflows were offset, in part, by cash inflows of $314.8 million in proceeds from the sale of long-lived assets, primarily due to the Glass Mountain disposal, and $28.8 million in distributions from equity method investments in excess of equity in earnings.

Distributions in excess of equity earnings represent cash distributions from White Cliffs and Glass Mountain in excess of our cumulative equity in earnings and are accounted for as a return of investment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we had net cash outflows of $228.3 million, primarily as a result of $312.5 million in capital expenditures and $4.2 million in contributions to equity method investments. These cash outflows were offset, in part, by cash inflows of $60.5 million in proceeds from the sale of common units of NGL Energy, an equity method investee, and $27.7 million in distributions from equity method investments in excess of equity in earnings. Capital expenditures included the U.S. Liquids segment's projects including the Maurepas Pipeline project, our U.S. Gas segment's northern Oklahoma expansion projects and our Canada segment's Wapiti expansion. Distributions in excess of equity earnings represent cash distributions from White Cliffs and Glass Mountain in excess of our cumulative equity in earnings and are accounted for as a return of investment.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had net cash outflows of $45.0 million, primarily as a result of $1.3 billion of borrowings (offset by $1.8 billion of principal payments including the final HFOTCO payment), $350.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of Maurepas Pipeline Class B shares, $342.3 million of net proceeds from the issuance of SemGroup Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, partially offset by $148.5 million of dividends paid, $4.7 million of payments related to debt issuances and $2.9 million of distributions to noncontrolling interests related to the Maurepas Pipeline Class B shares.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we had net cash inflows of $315.3 million, primarily as a result of $1.5 billion of borrowings and assumption of HFOTCO indebtedness (offset by $1.1 billion of principal payments), partially offset by $129.9 million of dividends paid, $16.3 million of debt extinguishment costs and $11.1 million of payments related to debt issuances. Debt extinguishment costs related to the early payoff of our 2021 Notes. Debt issuance costs primarily related to the issuance of our 2025 and 2026 Notes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we had net cash inflows of $75.9 million, primarily as a result of $382.5 million of borrowings (offset by $396.9 million of principal payments) and $223.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of common shares (net of offering costs), partially offset by $92.9 million of dividends paid, $32.1 million of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests and $7.7 million of payments related to debt issuances. Debt issuance costs primarily relate to the increase in capacity under the SemGroup credit facility.\nLong-term Debt\nSemGroup Senior Unsecured Notes\nAt December 31, 2018, we had outstanding $400 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2022, $350 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2023, $325 million of 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2025 and $300 million of 7.250% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (collectively, the \"Notes\"). The Notes are governed by indentures, as supplemented, between the Company and its subsidiary guarantors and Wilmington Trust, N.A., as trustee (the Indentures\u201d). The Indentures include customary covenants and events of default.\nAt December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the terms of the Indentures.\nSemGroup Revolving Credit Facility\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $119.5 million of cash borrowings outstanding under our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility. In addition, we had $24.3 million in outstanding letters of credit on that date. The maximum letter of credit capacity under this facility is $250 million. The facility can be increased up to $300 million with the consent of the administrative agent. The credit agreement expires on March 15, 2021.\nThe credit agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on the creation of new indebtedness, liens, sale and lease-back transactions, new investments, making fundamental changes including mergers and consolidations, making of dividends and other distributions, making material changes in our business, modifying certain documents and maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio, a senior secured leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. In addition, the credit agreement prohibits any commodity transactions that are not permitted by our Risk Governance Policies.\nThe terms of our credit facility restrict, to some extent, the payment of cash dividends on our common stock. The credit agreement is guaranteed by all of our wholly-owned, material domestic subsidiaries and secured by a lien on substantially all of our property and assets, subject to customary exceptions.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had available borrowing capacity of $856.2 million under this facility.\nHFOTCO Credit Agreement\nOn June 26, 2018, HFOTCO and Buffalo Gulf Coast Terminals LLC (\"BGCT\") entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement (the Amendment and Restatement Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Amendment and Restatement Agreement, the HFOTCO credit agreement was amended and restated in its entirety (as so amended and restated, the Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement\u201d).\nThe Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement increased the aggregate term loans incurred thereunder to $600 million, terminated the HFOTCO $75.0 million revolving credit facility, and extended the maturity date of the term loans to June 26, 2025 (the Maturity Date\u201d). In addition, HFOTCO may incur additional term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of $120 million and a measure of HFOTCO's EBITDA, defined in the credit agreement, at the time of determination, plus additional amounts subject to satisfaction of certain leverage-based criteria, subject to receiving commitments for such additional term loans from either new lenders or increased commitments from existing lenders. The term loan B was issued at a discount of $1.5 million.\nAt HFOTCO's option, the term loans will bear interest at the Eurodollar rate or an alternate base rate ( ABR\u201d), plus, in each case, an applicable margin of 2.75% relating to any term loans accruing interest at the Eurodollar rate and 1.75% relating to term loans accruing interest at ABR.\nThe Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement includes customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, which were made only for the purposes of the Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement and as of the specific date (or dates) set forth therein, and may be subject to certain limitations as agreed upon by the contracting parties, and apply only to BGCT, HFOTCO and any subsidiaries of HFOTCO party to the Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement. Such limitations include the creation of new liens, indebtedness, making of certain restricted payments and payments on indebtedness, making certain dispositions, making material changes in business activities, making fundamental changes including liquidations, mergers or consolidations, making certain investments, entering into certain transactions with affiliates, making amendments to material agreements, modifying the fiscal year, dealing with hazardous materials in certain ways, entering into certain hedging arrangements, entering into certain restrictive agreements, and funding or engaging in sanctioned activities.\nThe Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including events of default relating to inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect when made or when deemed made, non-payment of principal and other amounts owing under the Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement, including, in respect of, violation of covenants, cross acceleration to any material indebtedness of BGCT, HFOTCO and its subsidiaries, bankruptcy and insolvency events, certain unsatisfied judgments, certain ERISA events, certain invalidities of loan documents and the occurrence of a change of control. A default under the Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement would permit the participating banks to require immediate repayment of any outstanding loans with interest and any unpaid accrued fees, and subject to intercreditor arrangements with the holders of the HFOTCO tax exempt notes payable, exercise other rights and remedies.\nHFOTCO acquisition final payment\nOn April 17, 2018, we made the final payment related to the HFOTCO acquisition in the amount of $579.6 million. The payment was funded through revolving credit facility borrowings and cash on hand.\nSemCAMS Midstream\nOn February 25, 2019, SemCAMS Midstream entered into a credit agreement providing for a C$350.0 million senior secured term loan facility and a C$450.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility. For additional information, refer to Note 26 of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K.\nShelf Registration Statement\nWe have access to a universal shelf registration statement which provides us the ability to offer and sell an unlimited amount of debt and equity securities, subject to market conditions and our capital needs. This shelf registration statement expires in March 2019 and we intend to file a new universal shelf registration statement in March 2019.\nWe have also established an \"at the market\" offering program under the existing shelf registration statement, which provides for the offer and sale, from time to time, of common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $300 million. We are able to make sales in transactions at prices which are prevailing market prices at the time of sale, prices related to market prices or at negotiated prices. Such sales may be made pursuant to an Equity Distribution Agreement between us and certain agents who may act as sales agents or purchase for their own accounts as principals. To date, there have been no such sales.\nCapital Requirements\nThe midstream energy business can be capital intensive, requiring significant investment for the maintenance of existing assets or acquisition or development of new systems and facilities. We categorize our capital expenditures as either:\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expansion capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long-term; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maintenance capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures (including expenditures for the addition or improvement to, or the replacement of, our capital assets or for the acquisition of existing, or the construction or development of new, capital assets) made to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> During the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $390.7 million (cash basis), on capital projects. Projected capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, for 2019 are estimated at $262 million in expansion projects, including capital contributions to equity method investees to fund growth projects and $45 million in maintenance projects. These estimates may change as future events unfold. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nIn addition to our budgeted capital program, we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expansion capital expenditures in the future. Consequently, our ability to develop and maintain sources of funds to meet our capital requirements is critical to our ability to meet our growth objectives. We expect that our future expansion capital expenditures will be funded by cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities and the issuance of debt and equity securities.\nSemGroup Dividends\nThe table below sets out the dividends declared and/or paid by SemGroup for the periods indicated.\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Record Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dividend Per Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 7, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 17, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.45\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 15, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 26, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.45\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 18, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 28, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.45\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 20, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.45\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 9, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 19, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.4725\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 16, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 25, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.4725\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 20, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 28, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.4725\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 16, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 26, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.4725\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 4, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 14, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.4725\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn January 19, 2018, we sold to certain institutional investors, in a private placement, an aggregate of 350,000 shares of our Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Preferred Stock\u201d), convertible into shares of our Class A common stock. Holders of the Preferred Stock will receive quarterly distributions equal to an annual rate of 7.0% ($70.00 per share annualized) of $1,000 per share of Preferred Stock, subject to certain adjustments. With respect to any quarter ending on or prior to June 30, 2020, we may elect, in lieu of paying a distribution in cash, to have the amount that would have been payable if such dividend had been paid in cash added to the Liquidation Preference.\nOn February 20, 2019, we declared a dividend, in the aggregate, of $6.4 million to the holders of Preferred Stock. We elected to have the $6.4 million, that would have been paid in cash as a dividend, added to the liquidation preference of such shares as a payment-in-kind. The payment-in-kind on the shares of Preferred Stock is March 1, 2019, and the record date is February 22, 2019.\nCredit Risk\nWe are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. We examine the creditworthiness of third-party customers to whom we extend credit and manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions, we may request letters of credit, prepayments or guarantees.\nCustomer Concentration\nShell Trading (US) Company, a customer of our U.S. Liquids segment, accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, at approximately 26%. The contracts from which our revenues are derived from this customer primarily relate to our crude marketing operations and are for crude oil purchases and sales at market prices. We are not substantially dependent on such contracts and believe that if we were to lose any or all of these contracts, they could be readily replaced under substantially similar terms. Although we have contracts with customers of varying durations, if one or more of our major customers were to default on their contract, or if we were unable to renew our contract with one or more of these customers on favorable terms, we might not be able to replace any of these customers in a timely fashion, on favorable terms or at all. In any of these situations, our revenues and our ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected. We expect our exposure to risk of non-payment or non-performance to continue as long as we remain substantially dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues.\nOur U.S. Gas segment has a significant concentration of producers which account for a large portion of our U.S. Gas segment's volumes. During the year ended December 31, 2018, three producers accounted for approximately 89% of our total processed volumes. During the year ended December 31, 2018, two producers accounted for 83% of our total gathered volumes. Additionally, all of the gathering and processing volumes from these customers are produced in the Northern Oklahoma region.\nOur Canada segment's processing plants require a minimum rate of sulfur tonnage to operate and to comply with the regulatory requirements for air emissions. We have several large producers that provide significant sour gas to our plants. If these producers shut in their sour gas production due to current or future commodity prices, it could result in regulatory non-compliance, as well as operating and financial impacts to our Canada segment. We expect to mitigate this risk for our KA plant through a sulfur turn-down project that was placed into service in 2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Item 303 of Regulation S-K.\nCommitments\nContractual Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of business we enter into various contractual obligations for varying terms and amounts. The following table includes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, and our best estimate of the period in which the obligation will be settled (in thousands):\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>406,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>356,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,417,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (1)\n</td> <td>132,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>328,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>5,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Take-or-pay commitments (2)\n</td> <td>31,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments (3)\n</td> <td>981,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditure expansion projects\n</td> <td>104,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,261,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>172,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>277,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>543,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>474,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,793,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Assumes interest rates, fee rates and letters of credit and loans outstanding as of December 31, 2018, and that same remain constant thereafter until maturity except for required principal payments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Take-or-pay commitments include: (a) a five-year transportation take-or-pay agreement with White Cliffs for approximately 5,000 barrels per day which began in October 2015; (b) a seven-year transportation take-or-pay agreement for 5,000 barrels per day on a third-party pipeline which began in June 2017; and (c) a commitment related to fractionation of natural gas liquids through 2023.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>The bulk of the commitments shown in the table above relate to agreements to purchase product from a counterparty and to sell a similar amount of product (in a different location) to the same counterparty.

We have also entered into certain derivative instruments. See Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K.\nLetters of Credit\nIn connection with our purchasing activities, we provide certain suppliers and transporters with irrevocable standby letters of credit to secure our obligation for the purchase of petroleum products. Our liabilities with respect to these purchase obligations are recorded as accounts payable on our balance sheet in the month the petroleum products are purchased. Generally, these letters of credit are issued for 70-day periods (with a maximum of 364-day periods) and are terminated upon completion of each transaction. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $43.4 million and $110.8 million, respectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects and legal and regulatory challenges. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed.\nOn an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable. Actual results may differ substantially from our estimates. Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K. We identify our critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounting Policy\n</td> <td>Judgment/Uncertainty Affecting Application\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Taxes\n</td> <td>Ability to withstand legal challenges of tax authority decisions or appeals\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Anticipated future decisions of tax authorities\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Application of tax statutes and regulations to transactions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Ability to use tax benefits carry forwards to future periods\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Other Intangible Assets\n</td> <td>Recoverability of investment through future operations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Regulatory and political environments and requirements\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimated useful lives of assets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Environmental obligations and operational limitations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Identification of asset groups\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimates of future cash flows\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimates of fair value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Judgment about triggering events and held-for-sale classification\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill\n</td> <td>Judgment about impairment triggering events\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Identification of reporting units\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Purchase price allocation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimates of reporting unit's fair value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative Instruments\n</td> <td>Instruments used in valuation techniques\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Market maturity and economic conditions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Contract interpretation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Market conditions in the energy industry, especially the effects of price volatility on contractual commitments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingencies\n</td> <td>Estimated financial impact of event\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Judgment about the likelihood of event occurring\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Regulatory and political environments and requirements\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nAt December 31, 2018, we had a cumulative U.S. federal net operating loss of approximately $535.6 million that can be carried forward to apply against taxable income generated in future years. $350.4 million of this carryforward has an indefinite carryforward period and the remaining carryforward begins to expire in 2031. We had cumulative U.S. state net operating losses of approximately $371.0 million available for carryforward, which begin to expire in 2019. We had foreign net operating losses of $0.8 million available for carryforward, which begin to expire in 2025. We had foreign tax credits of approximately $44.6 million available for carryforward, which begin to expire in 2020. We had interest expense limitation of $31.8 million available for indefinite carryforward.\nConsiderable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws. We are subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions including Canada.\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Assets and Other Intangible Assets for Impairment\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment\u201d and ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d, we evaluate property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators are:\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>significant adverse change in the manner an asset is used or its physical condition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>adverse business climate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>change in our intent about an asset from an intent to hold such asset through the end of its estimated useful life to a greater than fifty percent likelihood that such asset will be disposed of before then.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows. However, actual future market prices and costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates and the impact of such variations could be material.\nGoodwill\nWe apply ASC 805, Business Combinations,\u201d and ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,\u201d to account for goodwill. In accordance with these standards, goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. However, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We test for impairment at the reporting unit level using three valuation approaches: first, the income approach which measures the value of an asset by the present value of its future economic benefit; second, the market approach which measures the value of an asset through the analysis of recent sales or offerings of comparable properties; and third, the cost approach which measures the value of an asset by the cost to reconstruct or replace it with another of like utility.\nEstimation of future economic benefit requires management to make assumptions about numerous variables including selling prices, costs, the level of activity and appropriate discount rates. When goodwill balances are material, such as with our HFOTCO acquisition, relatively minor revisions to assumptions could result in a material future impairment. If it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, our goodwill will be impaired at that time.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe follow the guidance of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging,\u201d to account for derivative instruments. ASC 815 requires us to mark-to-market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet, and recognize changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments immediately in earnings. In certain cases, we may apply hedge accounting to our derivative instruments. The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are: (i) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure; (ii) whether the overall risk is being reduced; and (iii) if there is a correlation between the fair value of the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments accounted for as hedges are either recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the related hedged item, or deferred and recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur.\nCertain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered to be a normal purchase normal sale ( NPNS\u201d). The availability of this exception is based on the assumption that the company has the ability, and it is probable, to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item. These assumptions are based on internal forecasts of sales and historical physical delivery on contracts. Derivatives that are considered to be NPNS are exempt from derivative accounting treatment and are accounted for under accrual accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with immediate recognition through earnings.\nContingencies\nWe record a loss contingency when management determines that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. Gain contingencies are not recorded until realized.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K.\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe, and our significant equity method investee, own gathering systems, transportation pipelines, crude oil transport trucks, processing plants, storage facilities and terminals in Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming and in Alberta, Canada.\nGeneral Trends and Outlook\nThe prices of crude oil and natural gas have historically been volatile. For example, from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2018, the NYMEX prompt month settle price ranged from a high of $107.26 per barrel to a low of $26.21 per barrel. The range for natural gas during that period was $6.15 to $1.64 per MMBtu. Substantial declines in crude oil and natural gas prices, particularly prolonged declines, can have negative effects on producers including:\n\u2022reduced revenue, operating income and cash flows;\n\u2022reduced volume of crude oil and natural gas that can be produced economically;\n\u2022delayed or postponed capital projects; and/or\n\u2022limited access to or increased cost of capital, such as equity and long-term debt.\nThe substantial declines in crude oil and natural gas prices since mid-2014 and continuing throughout 2018 have had these effects on a number of companies in the oil and gas industry, including our customers. While we do not have significant direct exposure to commodity prices, we are exposed to a reduction in volumes to be transported, stored, gathered, processed and marketed as a result of lower prices. Additionally, changes to price differentials between basins also impact our crude oil marketing operations. We were impacted by these factors in 2018 and expect them to continue in 2019.\nWe continue to execute on our de-leveraging strategy. We have pre-funded capital growth projects and reduced debt leverage through the issuance of subsidiary preferred equity representing a 49% interest in Maurepas Pipeline for $350 million in November of 2018 and our 2019 contribution of our Canadian business to a joint venture with KKR which returned $484 million of cash to SemGroup. We own a 51% interest in the joint venture which subsequently acquired Meritage Midstream ULC and its midstream infrastructure assets for approximately $490 million. The transaction closed on February 25, 2019.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance. We view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and review these measurements on at least a monthly basis for consistency and trend analysis. These metrics include financial measures such as operating expenses, Segment Profit and Adjusted EBITDA and operating data including contracted storage capacity and sales, transportation and processing volumes.\nOperating Expenses\nOur management seeks to maximize the profitability of our operations, in part, by minimizing operating expenses. These expenses are comprised of salary and wage expense, utility costs, insurance premiums, taxes and other operating costs, some of which are independent of the volumes we handle.\nSegment Profit\nOur management analyzes the performance of our operating segments through our segment profit measure which is defined as revenue, less cost of products sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and operating expenses, plus equity earnings and is adjusted to remove unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and to reflect equity earnings on an EBITDA basis. Reflecting equity earnings on an EBITDA basis is achieved by adjusting equity earnings to exclude our percentage of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from equity earnings for operated equity method investees. For our investment in NGL Energy, we exclude equity earnings and include cash distributions received.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization and adjusted for selected items that we believe impact the comparability of financial results between reporting periods. In addition to non-cash items, we have selected items for adjustment to EBITDA which management feels decrease the comparability of our results among periods. These items are identified as those which are generally outside of the results of day-to-day operations of the business. These items are not considered non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, but do erode comparability among periods in which they occur with periods in which they do not occur or occur to a greater or lesser degree.\nHistorically, we have selected items such as gains on the sale of NGL Energy common units, costs related to our predecessor's bankruptcy, significant business development related costs, significant legal settlements, severance and other similar costs. Management believes these types of items can make comparability of the results of day to day operations among periods difficult and have chosen to remove these items from our Adjusted EBITDA. We expect to adjust for similar types of items in the future. Although we present selected items that we consider in evaluating our performance, you should be aware that the items presented do not represent all items that affect comparability between the periods presented. Variations in our operating results are also caused by changes in volumes, prices, mechanical interruptions and numerous other factors. We do not adjust for these types of variances.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to assess:\n \u2022 our operating performance as compared to that of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis, capital structure or the impact of fluctuating commodity prices; and \n \u2022 the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.  Note About Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations.\nNet income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing the utility.\nManagement compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable GAAP measure, understanding the difference between Adjusted EBITDA and net income (loss) and incorporating this knowledge into its decision-making processes. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a historical basis for each of the periods indicated.\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

</tr>\n</table>\nBusiness and Performance Drivers\nWe operate our core businesses through three business segments: U.S. Liquids, U.S. Gas and Canada. We generate revenue in these segments by using our assets to provide products and services to third parties and by selectively using our assets to support our marketing activities.\nCertain factors are key to our operations. These include the safe, reliable and efficient operation of the pipelines and facilities that we own and operate, while meeting the regulations that govern the operation of our assets and the costs associated with such regulations.\nRevenue\nOur revenue is generated through the gathering, transportation, processing and storage of petroleum products. Our customers pay us fees based on volumes gathered, transported, processed and stored. We also generate revenue by marketing petroleum products.\nWe may use futures, swaps and options contracts to manage our exposure to market changes in commodity prices, to protect our gross margins on our purchased petroleum products and to manage our liquidity risk associated with margin deposit requirements on our overall derivative positions. When purchasing petroleum products, we seek to manage our exposure to commodity price risk. As we purchase inventory from suppliers, we may establish a fixed or variable margin with future sales using one of the following methods:\n \u2022 we have already sold that product for physical delivery pursuant to sales contracts at a market index price, \n \u2022 we sell the product for future physical delivery pursuant to effectively back-to-back sales contracts, or \n \u2022 we enter into futures and swaps contracts on the NYMEX or over the counter markets.  In addition, we may purchase put options or derivatives other than futures or swaps to hedge our inventory of petroleum products prior to our sale of such inventory.\nVolumes\nGenerally, we expect revenue to increase or decrease in conjunction with increases or decreases in total volumes. Our total volumes are affected by various factors, including our physical storage or transportation capacity, our working capital and credit availability under our credit facilities to support petroleum product purchases and the availability of the supply of petroleum product available for purchase, which is determined based primarily upon producer activity in areas near our asset base.\nCommodity Prices\nOur business is primarily fee based. As a result, our financial results are typically not directly correlated with increases and decreases in commodity prices. Our financial results, however, are positively correlated with the absolute difference between current (prompt) and future month petroleum product prices. That is, wide contango (when the prices for future deliveries are higher than current prices) spreads generally have a favorable impact on our results relative to a slightly contango, flat or backwardated (when the prices for future deliveries are lower than current prices) market. While we do not have significant direct exposure to commodity prices, we are exposed to reductions in volumes transported, stored, gathered, processed and marketed as a result of lower prices. Additionally, changes to price differentials between basins also impact our crude oil marketing operations.\nTiming of Purchase and Sales\nOur financial results are affected by the timing of the purchase and sale of petroleum products, such that financial results may not be comparable between periods. When we enter into an arrangement to purchase product, place the product in storage and resell the product in the future, our financial results do not reflect any related margin until the settlement of the product sale. Prior to the settlement of the product sale, our results reflect the cost of the product in our inventory. Differences in the timing of our product purchases and sales, especially if they extend over fiscal years or quarters, may result in sizable differences between our results over the comparable period.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

operating expenses\nRevenue, costs of products sold and operating expenses are analyzed by operating segment below.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased in 2018 to $91.6 million from $113.8 million in 2017. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in acquisition related costs, the disposition of our U.K. and Mexican businesses in early 2018 and full year of expense related to our HFOTCO acquisition, which was acquired in July of 2017. Current year acquisition related costs are $2.7 million compared with $22.0 million in the prior year, primarily due to the HFOTCO acquisition. Our U.K. and Mexican businesses incurred a combined $4.1 million of general and administrative expense in the current year prior to their disposals compared with a combined $16.0 million in the prior year. The decreases in general and administrative expense were offset by an increase of $7.8 million from the prior year for the HFOTCO business as a result of a full year of operations in 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased in 2017 to $113.8 million from $84.2 million in 2016 primarily due to $26 million of HFOTCO related costs, of which $22 million were acquisition related costs. General and administrative costs for Canada increased by $3 million compared to prior year primarily due to employment costs, office costs and an increase in foreign exchange rates between periods.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization costs increased in 2018 to $209.3 million from $158.4 million in 2017, primarily due to a full year of depreciation and amortization from the HFOTCO acquisition and the Maurepas Pipeline which was placed in service in 2017 and other projects placed in-service during the period, partially offset by the disposition of our U.K. and Mexican businesses. The increase due to HFOTCO was $38.0 million, the increase due to the Maurepas Pipeline was $14.9 million and the decrease due to the U.K. and Mexican business dispositions was $11.7 million.\nDepreciation and amortization costs increased in 2017 to $158.4 million from $98.8 million in 2016, of which $44 million related to the HFOTCO assets including finite-lived intangible assets acquired in July 2017. The Maurepas Pipeline which was placed in service in 2017 accounted for $11 million of the increase. The remaining increase relates to smaller projects placed in-service during the period.\nLoss (gain) on disposal or impairment, net\nIn 2018 we had a net gain on disposal or impairment of $3.6 million. The net gain was primarily a result of small gains due to the finalization of the sales of our U.K. and Mexican businesses and a post-closing adjustment of $1.4 million related to the disposal of Glass Mountain in 2017.\nLoss on disposal or impairment, net in 2017 was $13.3 million. The net loss on disposal or impairment in 2017 was due to the following (in thousands):\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Segment\n</td> <td>Loss/(Gain)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Write-down Mexican asphalt business to net realizable value\n</td> <td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Write-down U.K. operations to net realizable value\n</td> <td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>76,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sherman natural gas gathering and processing asset impairment\n</td> <td>U.S. Gas\n</td> <td>30,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil trucking goodwill impairment\n</td> <td>U.S. Liquids\n</td> <td>26,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil trucking intangible asset impairment\n</td> <td>U.S. Liquids\n</td> <td>12,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of Glass Mountain\n</td> <td>U.S. Liquids\n</td> <td>(150,266\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on disposal or impairment, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe write-downs of the Mexican asphalt business and the U.K. operations to net realizable value was due to the businesses being categorized as held-for-sale at December 31, 2017.\nThe impairment of our Sherman, Texas natural gas gathering and processing assets was due to the evaluation of capital raising alternatives which indicated that the carrying value of our Sherman, Texas assets might be in excess of fair value. We used an income approach, based on a discounted cash flow model, to estimate the fair value of the assets, which resulted in a non-cash impairment.\nThe impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of our crude oil trucking business was due to a reduction in the long range forecast for crude oil trucking due to the on-going challenging business environment. We viewed the decrease in the forecast as a triggering event that indicated a potential impairment and performed an interim impairment analysis on the business unit's assets including goodwill and intangible assets.\nWe performed a recoverability test of our definite lived assets under ASC 360 whereby we compared the undiscounted cash flows of the asset group, which was determined to be the entire crude oil trucking reporting unit and included goodwill, to the carrying value of the assets at September 30, 2017. This test indicated that the assets were not fully recoverable. Therefore, we estimated the fair value of the definite lived assets using an income approach, supplemented by a market approach to measure impairment. We also performed an interim impairment test of our goodwill associated with the crude oil trucking reporting unit and determined the estimated fair value was less than the adjusted carrying value of the reporting unit resulting in impairment of goodwill. The cash flow models used to determine recoverability of our assets and to measure impairment expense involved using significant judgments and assumptions, which included the discount rate, anticipated revenue and volume growth rates, estimated operating expenses and capital expenditures, which were based on our operating and capital budgets as well as our strategic plans. We considered the market approach by comparing the revenue and earnings multiples implied by our income approach to those of comparable companies for reasonableness and for estimating the fair value of certain assets of our reporting unit.\nThe gain on the sale of Glass Mountain is due to the December 22, 2017 sale of our ownership interest in Glass Mountain for $300 million, subject to working capital and other adjustments.\nLoss on disposal or impairment, net in 2016 was primarily due to a $13.1 million impairment of U.S. Gas goodwill as a result of producer forecast reductions following the release of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission's Regional Earthquake Response Plan which curtailed the amount of volume that can be injected into disposal wells.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased in 2018 to $149.7 million from $103.0 million in 2017. The increase is primarily the result of a net increase of $15.2 million related to the $300 million, 7.25% senior unsecured notes sold in September 2017, the $325 million, 6.375% senior unsecured notes sold in March 2017, and the early payoff of $300 million, 7.50% senior unsecured notes sold in March 2017. There was a $22.1 million increase in HFOTCO bank interest due to a full year of interest in 2018 compared to only six months interest in 2017. These net increases were offset by a net decrease in capitalized interest of $5.8 million due to fewer U.S. projects in 2018 and the initial on-line operations of the Maurepas Pipeline, offset slightly by increased projects in Canada.\nInterest increased in 2017 to $103.0 million from $62.7 million in 2016. The increase is primarily the result of $28.4 million related to HFOTCO debt subsequent to acquisition including accretion of the final payment, $22.8 million attributable to the new $325 million, 6.375% senior unsecured notes sold in March 2017 and the $300 million, 7.25% senior unsecured notes sold in September 2017 and $8.6 million due to increased borrowings on SemGroup's revolving credit facility. These increases were offset by a $17.8 million decrease in interest expense due to the early payoff of $300 million, 7.50% senior unsecured notes in March 2017.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased $290 million of our outstanding $300 million senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the 2021 Notes\u201d) through a tender offer. The price included a premium and interest to the purchase date. A notice of redemption was issued for the remaining $10 million of 2021 Notes, which were not redeemed through the tender offer pursuant to the redemption and satisfaction and discharge provisions of the indenture governing the 2021 Notes. The redemption price includes a redemption premium and interest to the redemption date. As a result, we recognized a loss of $19.9 million on the early extinguishment of the 2021 Notes, which included premiums of $15.9 million and the write off of $3.6 million of associated unamortized debt issuance costs.\nForeign currency transaction loss (gain)\nForeign currency transaction changed to a loss of $9.5 million in 2018 from a gain of $4.7 million in 2017. The change is primarily due to realized and unrealized losses of $10.2 million on foreign currency forwards for purchases of Canadian dollars to limit exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations for capital contributions to our Canadian operations compared with $2.8 million of realized and unrealized gains in the prior year. The remaining change is primarily due to foreign currency changes related to U.S. dollar denominated payables of our U.K. business which was sold in early 2018.\nForeign currency transaction changed to a gain of $4.7 million in 2017 from a loss of $4.8 million in 2016. The change is primarily due to changes in the foreign currency rates and amounts of U.S. dollar denominated payables of our U.K. business compared to the prior year and $2.8 million of realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency forwards entered into in the fourth quarter of 2017. The forwards are for purchases of Canadian dollars to limit exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations for capital contributions to our Canadian operations.\nLoss on sale or impairment of non-operated equity method investment\nIn 2016, we incurred a $30.6 million loss due to a $39.8 million other-than-temporary impairment recorded on our NGL Energy common units, partially offset by a $9.1 million gain on the sale of remaining NGL Energy common units in 2016.\nResults of Operations by Reporting Segment\nU.S. Liquids\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,680,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,299,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>716,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pipeline transportation\n</td> <td>84,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Truck transportation\n</td> <td>23,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Storage fees\n</td> <td>161,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility service fees\n</td> <td>49,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease revenue\n</td> <td>17,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>2,017,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,493,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>827,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of products sold\n</td> <td>1,646,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,259,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>652,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expense\n</td> <td>134,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gain (loss) on commodity derivatives, net\n</td> <td>5,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(989\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from equity method investments\n</td> <td>57,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to reflect equity earnings on an EBITDA basis\n</td> <td>19,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>229,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross product sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,357,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,616,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,118,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonmonetary transaction adjustment\n</td> <td>(3,681,827\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,317,421\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,401,200\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gain (loss) on commodity derivatives, net\n</td> <td>5,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(989\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,680,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,299,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>716,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 versus 2017\nRevenues\nProduct sales increased in 2018 to $1.7 billion from $1.3 billion in 2017.\nGross product revenue increased in 2018 to $5.4 billion from $4.6 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the average sales price to $65 per barrel in 2018, from an average sales price of $50 per barrel in 2017, partially offset by a decrease in the volume sold to 83 million barrels in 2018 from 92 million barrels in 2017. Volumes decreased as compared to prior year due to fewer location trades.\nGross product revenue was reduced by $3.7 billion and $3.3 billion during 2018 and 2017, respectively, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 845-10-15, \"Nonmonetary Transactions,\" (\"ASC 845-10-15\"). ASC 845-10-15 requires that certain transactions -- those where inventory is purchased from a customer then resold to the same customer -- to be presented in the income statement on a net basis, resulting in a reduction of revenue and costs of products sold by the same amount.\nPipeline transportation revenue increased to $84.9 million in 2018 from $43.6 million in 2017, primarily due to an increase of $37.9 million, as a result of a full year of operations on the Maurepas Pipeline, and a $3.5 million increase on the WOT due to higher transportation volumes.\nTruck transportation revenue decreased to $23.6 million in 2018 from $31.4 million in 2017, due to lower transportation volumes.\nStorage revenue increased to $161.5 million in 2018 from $85.7 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $78.1 million reflecting a full year of HFOTCO operations, partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in crude storage compared to prior year, as the average capacity leased by storage customers decreased to 5.9 million barrels from 6.3 million barrels.\nFacility service fees increased to $49.9 million in 2018 from $27.7 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $26.2 million reflecting a full year of HFOTCO operations, partially offset by a $4.6 million decrease at Platteville as a result of lower truck unloading volumes.\nLease revenue increased to $17.5 million in 2018 from $5.8 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to a full year of HFOTCO operations.\nCost of Products Sold\nCosts of products sold increased in 2018 to $1.7 billion from $1.3 billion in 2017. The cost of products sold reflect reductions of $3.7 billion and $3.3 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively, in accordance with ASC 845-10-15. There was a decrease in the barrels sold, as described above, combined with an increase in the average per barrel cost of crude oil to $65 in 2018 from $50 in 2017.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2018 to $134.2 million from $99.3 million in 2017 due to a $35.9 million increase at HFOTCO reflecting a full year of operations, as well as other increases in insurance and taxes and maintenance and repair expense, partially offset by a decrease in outside services.\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Commodity Derivatives, net\nUnrealized gain (loss) on commodity derivatives, net increased in 2018 to a gain of $5.1 million from a loss of $40.0 thousand in 2017. The gain is due to open positions and changes in market prices in the current year.\nEarnings from Equity Method Investments\nEarnings from equity method investments decreased in 2018 to $57.6 million from $67.3 million in 2017. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of Glass Mountain and decreased earnings by White Cliffs of $7.5 million and $2.2 million, respectively.\n2017 versus 2016\nRevenue\nProduct sales increased in 2017 to $1.3 billion from $716.6 million in 2016.\nGross product revenue increased in 2017 to $4.6 billion from $3.1 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the volume sold to 92 million barrels at an average sales price of $50 per barrel in 2017, from the volume sold of 75 million barrels at an average sales price of $42 per barrel in 2016. Volumes increased as compared to prior year due to additional location trades.\nGross product revenue was reduced by $3.3 billion and $2.4 billion during 2017 and 2016, respectively, in accordance with ASC 845-10-15.\nPipeline transportation revenue increased to $43.6 million in 2017 from $23.1 million in 2016. The increase was primarily the result of $20.8 million related to the start-up of the Maurepas Pipeline and a $3.7 million increase on the WOT. These increases were partially offset by a $3.6 million reduction related to the Tampa Pipeline, that was sold in the first quarter of 2017.\nTruck transportation revenue decreased to $31.4 million in 2017 from $41.8 million in 2016, primarily as a result of slightly lower volumes and rates.\nStorage fee revenue increased in 2017 to $85.7 million from $27.7 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to the 2017 acquisition of HFOTCO resulting in $60.5 million of revenue, offset by a reduction in crude oil storage revenue of\n$2.2 million, mainly resulting from scheduled tank cleanings, as the average capacity leased by storage customers decreased to 6.2 million barrels from 6.6 million barrels. The remainder is due to decreases in pump-over revenue of $0.7 million, third-party unloading revenue of $0.3 million and other revenue of $0.2 million.\nFacility service fees increased to $27.7 million in 2017 from $18.3 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $10.6 million reflecting the 2017 acquisition of HFOTCO, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease at Platteville as a result of lower truck unloading volumes.\nCosts of Products Sold\nCosts of products sold increased in 2017 to $1.3 billion from $652.4 million in 2016. The cost of products sold reflects reductions of $3.3 billion and $2.4 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively, in accordance with ASC 845-10-15. There was an increase in the barrels sold, as described above, combined with an increase in the average per barrel cost of crude oil to $50 in 2017 from $41 in 2016.\nThe increase in cost of products sold outpaced the increase in revenue leading to a decrease in segment profit of $31.8 million as compared to the prior year. This is primarily due to lower blending margins of $8.2 million due to increased competition at Cushing, lower contango margins of $5.8 million, increased pipeline transportation fees of $8.2 million related to firm commitments beginning in June 2017 and increased truck transportation fees of $7.3 million related to increased volume.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2017 to $99.3 million from $82.8 million in 2016 due to a $15.3 million increase as a result of the acquisition of HFOTCO during 2017.\nU.S. Gas\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service fees\n</td> <td>54,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>265,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>233,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>218,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>165,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expense\n</td> <td>32,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 versus 2017\nRevenues\nRevenues increased in 2018 to $265.3 million from $233.2 million in 2017. The increase is primarily due to higher volumes (134,135 MMcf in 2018 compared to 101,709 MMcf for 2017) and higher average NGL basket price of $0.86/gallon in 2018 versus $0.85/gallon in 2017. The increase was partially offset by lower average natural gas NYMEX price of $3.09/MMbtu in 2018 versus $3.11/MMbtu in 2017. Volume increases are primarily due to Stack production, offset by reduced Mississippi Lime drilling, coupled with natural well production declines.\nGathering and processing fee revenue increased in 2018 to $54.5 million from $52.6 million in 2017. In the current year, certain fees are reported as gathering and processing fee revenue under ASU 2016-15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( ASC 606\u201d), whereas in the prior year these amounts were reported as reductions to cost of sales under ASC 605. The current year includes $15.0 million of fee revenue which would have been included as a reduction to cost of sales under the prior year methodology. Exclusive of the impact of ASC 606, fee revenue decreased by $13.1 million due lower product recovery fees and unfavorable contract mix, partially offset by higher volumes.\nCost of Products Sold\nCost of products sold increased in 2018 to $165.5 million from $135.7 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher NGL prices, the impact of ASC 606 discussed above, offset by lower Mississippi Lime volumes and lower natural gas prices.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased slightly in 2018 to $32.7 million from $29.7 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to compression overhauls, turbine maintenance, and employee costs.\n2017 versus 2016\nRevenue\nRevenue increased in 2017 to $233.2 million from $219.0 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a higher average natural gas NYMEX price of $3.108/MMbtu in 2017 versus $2.46/MMbtu in 2016, a higher average NGL basket price of $0.85/gallon in 2017 versus $0.65/gallon in 2016, and increased fees of $53 million in 2017 versus $52 million in 2016 due to higher rates. The increase was offset, in part, by lower volume (101,709 million cubic feet in 2017 versus 116,748 million cubic feet in 2016).\nCosts of Products Sold\nCosts of products sold increased in 2017 to $135.7 million from $120.5 million in 2016. The increase was attributable to higher prices and was offset, in part, by lower volume processed in northern Oklahoma.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense decreased in 2017 to $29.7 million from $31.9 million in 2016. This decrease was due to lower equipment lease, field expense (which includes materials and supplies, lubricants, water disposal, electricity and fuel), maintenance/repair, and office expense. All decreases are primarily driven by lower volume in northern Oklahoma. These decreases were offset by increases in employment, outside services, taxes, and other expenses.\nCanada\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>59,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>193,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expense\n</td> <td>111,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 versus 2017\nRevenue\nRevenue increased in 2018 to $193.1 million from $183.2 million in 2017. This increase is primarily due to higher operating costs recoveries of $5.2 million, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between periods of $1.7 million and higher gathering and processing revenue of $1.3 million. These increases were offset, in part, by true-ups of take-or-pay minimum volumes commitments of $3.6 million. Further, a 31-day planned outage at the KA plant in 2018 decreased gathering and processing revenue by $2.2 million. This was offset by the 2017 planned outage at the K3 plant which decreased gathering and processing revenue by $2.5 million.\nAdditionally, subsequent to the adoption of ASC 606, we recognized $4.5 million of revenue, to recognize certain deficiencies on take-or-pay agreements for which there is a contractual make-up period. Under ASC 605, revenue related to\ndeficiencies with a make-up period was deferred until the contractual right to make up a deficiency expired. Under ASC 606, we can recognize all or a portion of revenue related to deficiencies before the make-up period expires if we determine that it is probable that the customer will not make-up all or some of its deficient volumes, for example if there is insufficient capacity to make up the deficient volumes in future periods.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2018 to $111.5 million from $106.8 million in 2017. This increase is primarily due to turnaround costs related to the KA plant of $25.6 million, higher power costs of $5.0 million, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates between periods of $1.4 million. These increases were offset, in part, by turnaround costs in 2017 for the K3 plant of $27.2 million.\n2017 versus 2016\nRevenue\nRevenue increased in 2017 to $183.2 million from $133.2 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to higher operating cost recoveries of $27.6 million (primarily attributable to the K3 plant turnaround), higher gathering and processing revenue of $4.7 million, non-recurring 2016 fee concessions of $4.6 million, true-up of take-or-pay minimum volumes commitments of $4.4 million and changes in foreign currency exchange rates between periods of $3.1 million.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2017 to $106.8 million from $79.8 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to turnaround costs related to the K3 plant, offset by lower contractor costs of $4.1 million.\nCorporate and Other\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of products sold\n</td> <td>10,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expense\n</td> <td>6,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from equity method investments\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to reflect NGL Energy equity earnings on a cash basis\n</td> <td>(47\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate and Other is not an operating segment. This table is included to permit the reconciliation of segment information to that of the consolidated Company. The amounts reported for the year ended December 31, 2016 above have been recast to include our former U.K. and Mexico segments which, subsequent to our acquisition of HFOTCO, were no longer expected to be significant for separate presentation. The main activities of our U.K. operations were the receipt, storage and redelivery of clean petroleum and crude oil products via sea-going vessels. Our U.K. revenue was based on fixed-fee storage tank leases and related services. Revenue from our Mexico operations was based on contractual arrangements with customers for liquid asphalt cement. Our U.K. operations and Mexico operations were sold in 2018. Earnings from equity method investments in the table above relates to our investments in NGL Energy.\n2018 versus 2017\nThe decreases in revenues, cost of products sold and operating expenses are due to the disposal of our U.K. operations and Mexican asphalt business in early 2018 compared with a full year of operations for both entities in the prior year.\n2017 versus 2016\nRevenues\nThe increase in revenue relates primarily to higher revenues in our Mexico operations ($155 million in 2017 compared to $139 million in 2016), mostly due to higher product sales prices, partially offset by slightly lower volume and foreign exchange impacts between periods. Revenue in our U.K. operations increased to $28 million in 2017 compared to $25 million in 2016, primarily as a result of increased storage volume thereby creating increased throughput revenue and storage volume and price variances. The remaining change was primarily due to an increase in the intersegment eliminations which are reported in Corporate and Other. Intersegment revenues relate to product sales from our U.S. Gas segment to our U.S. Liquids segment.\nCosts of products sold\nThe increase in costs of products sold relates primarily to higher costs in Mexico ($131 million in 2017 compared to $111 million in 2016), as a result of higher unit costs in Mexico, partially offset by lower volume.\nEarnings from Equity Method Investments\nThe decrease in earnings from equity method investments is due to the sale of our limited partner interest in NGL Energy in April of 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOur principal sources of short-term liquidity are cash generated from our operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. The consolidated cash balance on December 31, 2018 was $86.7 million. Of this amount, $17.1 million was held in Canada and may be subject to tax if transferred to the U.S. Potential sources of long-term liquidity include issuances of debt securities and equity securities and the sale of assets. Our primary cash requirements currently are operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt payments and our quarterly dividends. In general, we expect to fund:\n \u2022 operating expenses, maintenance capital expenditures and cash dividends through existing cash and cash from operating activities; \n \u2022 expansion capital expenditures and any working capital deficits through cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities and the issuance of debt securities and equity securities; \n \u2022 acquisitions through cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities, the issuance of debt securities and equity securities and proceeds from the divestiture of assets or interests in assets; and \n \u2022 debt principal payments through cash from operating activities and refinancings when the credit facility becomes due.  Our ability to meet our financing requirements and fund our planned capital expenditures will depend on our future operating performance and distributions from our equity investments, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry. In addition, we are subject to conditions in the debt and equity markets for any issuances of debt securities and equity securities. There can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets in the future. If we would be unable or unwilling to access those markets, we could be required to restrict future cash outlays, such as expansion capital expenditures and potential future acquisitions.\nWe believe our cash from operations and our remaining borrowing capacity allow us to manage our day-to-day cash requirements, distribute our quarterly dividends and meet our capital expenditure commitments for the coming year.\nThe following table summarizes our changes in unrestricted cash for the periods presented:\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement of cash flow data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>269,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(229,670\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(439,801\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(228,284\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(45,004\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>315,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal\n</td> <td>(4,970\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(2,074\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,479\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(7,044\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n</td> <td>93,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe components of operating cash flows can be summarized as follows:\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24,328\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,150\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash expenses, net\n</td> <td>248,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in operating assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>45,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33,023\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,966\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>269,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 Compared to 2017\nAdjustments to net income for non-cash expenses increased to $248.2 million in 2018 from $190.6 million in 2017. Significant changes from prior year include:\n \u2022 $50.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to the HFOTCO acquisition and completion of the Maurepas Pipeline; \n \u2022 $18.1 million due to a deferred tax expense in the current year compared to deferred tax benefit in the prior year, primarily as a result of the change to the federal statutory income tax rate and other discrete tax items in 2017; \n \u2022 $14.2 million due to current year currency losses as compared to prior year currency gains primarily due to foreign currency forwards for purchases of Canadian dollars to limit exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations for capital contributions to our Canadian operations; \n \u2022 $9.7 million reduction in earnings from equity method investments due to the sale of Glass Mountain Pipeline in December 2017, as well as rate reductions on White Cliffs Pipeline partially offset by higher volumes; \n \u2022 $4.7 million increase in write-downs of inventory to net realizable value; \n \u2022 $3.0 million due to a pension curtailment gain related to the HFOTCO pension which was curtailed subsequent to acquisition in the prior year; \n \u2022 $1.4 million amortization of debt costs; and \n \u2022 $1.3 million non-cash equity compensation.  These increases to the adjustments to net income for non-cash expenses, net were offset by decreases due to:\n \u2022 a decrease of $19.9 million in loss on the early extinguishment of our 2021 Notes in the prior year; \n \u2022 a decrease of $16.9 million in losses on disposal and impairments primarily due to small current year gains from the finalization of the sales of our U.K. and Mexican businesses and a post-closing adjustment related to our Glass Mountain disposal compared to prior year gain on disposal of Glass Mountain offset by impairments \nrelated to the held for sale status of our Mexican asphalt business and our U.K. operations and impairments to U.S. Gas and U.S. Liquids assets; and\n \u2022 a $9.1 million decrease in distributions from equity method investees primarily due to the disposition of Glass Mountain in the prior year.  Changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2018 relative to the prior year-end consisted primarily of:\n \u2022 a $52.2 million decrease in inventory due to a reduction in the number of barrels on hand and crude oil price declines compared to prior year end; \n \u2022 a $79.3 million decrease in accounts receivable, including receivable from affiliates, generally due to timing of sales and changes in commodity prices and volumes; \n \u2022 a $3.4 million increase in other current assets and a $1.6 million increase in other assets; and \n \u2022 a $82.0 million decrease in accounts payable, including payable to affiliates, and accrued liabilities generally due to timing of purchases and changes in commodity prices and volumes.  2017 Compared to 2016\nNon-cash expenses increased to $190.6 million in 2017 from $178.7 million in 2016. Significant changes from prior year include:\n \u2022 a $59.6 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to the HFOTCO acquisition; \n \u2022 a $19.9 million loss on the early extinguishment of our 2021 Notes in the current year; \n \u2022 a $6.4 million increase due to lower current year earnings from equity method investments as compared with the prior year primarily due to lower White Cliffs volumes and the prior year sale of our limited partner investment in NGL Energy;  These increases to non-cash adjustment to net income were offset by:\n \u2022 $30.6 million decrease due to the prior year other-than-temporary impairment recorded on our limited partner investment in NGL Energy, partially offset by prior year gain on the sale of our common limited partner units of NGL Energy; \n \u2022 a decrease of $18.3 million due to a deferred tax benefit in the current year compared to deferred tax expense in the prior year primarily as a result of changes to federal statutory income tax rates and a current year pre-tax loss compared with prior year pre-tax income; \n \u2022 a $9.7 million decrease in distributions from equity method investees primarily due to the disposition of our limited partner unit investment in NGL Energy in the prior year and lower volumes on White Cliffs; \n \u2022 a $9.5 million decrease due to currency gains as compared to prior year currency losses; \n \u2022 a $3.0 million decrease due to a pension curtailment gain related to the HFOTCO pension which was curtailed subsequent to acquisition; and \n \u2022 a decrease of $2.7 million in losses on disposal and impairments primarily due to gain on disposal of Glass Mountain offset by impairments related to the held for sale status of our Mexican asphalt business and our U.K. operations and impairments to U.S. Gas and U.S. Liquids assets.  Changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2017 relative to the prior year-end consisted primarily of:\n \u2022 $213.6 million increase in accounts receivable, including receivable from affiliates, generally due to higher commodity prices and volumes; \n \u2022 $17.9 million increase in inventory primarily due to increased inventory of our U.S. Liquids segment due to an additional 0.3 million barrels of crude oil on hand at a higher weighted average cost; \n \u2022 $190.4 million increase in accounts payable, including payable to affiliates, and accrued liabilities generally due to higher prices and volumes and timing of purchases; and \n \u2022 $19.4 million increase in other noncurrent liabilities primarily due to accretion of the final payment in the HFOTCO acquisition. \nInvesting Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had net cash outflows of $229.7 million, primarily as a result of $390.7 million in capital expenditures and $7.8 million in contributions to equity method investments. These cash outflows were offset, in part, by cash inflows of $147.8 million in proceeds from business divestitures and $19.1 million in distributions from equity method investments in excess of equity in earnings. Capital expenditures included our Canada segment's Wapiti expansion and our U.S. Liquids segment's expansion projects at our Gulf Coast terminal. Distributions in excess of equity earnings represent cash distributions from White Cliffs in excess of our cumulative equity in earnings and are accounted for as a return of investment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we had net cash outflows of $439.8 million, primarily as a result of $462.7 million in capital expenditures, $294.2 million cash paid as a portion of the first payment to acquire HFOTCO and $26.4 million in contributions to equity method investments. These cash outflows were offset, in part, by cash inflows of $314.8 million in proceeds from the sale of long-lived assets, primarily due to the Glass Mountain disposal, and $28.8 million in distributions from equity method investments in excess of equity in earnings. Capital expenditures included the U.S. Liquids segment's projects including the Maurepas Pipeline project, our U.S. Gas segment's northern Oklahoma expansion projects and our Canada segment's Wapiti expansion. Distributions in excess of equity earnings represent cash distributions from White Cliffs and Glass Mountain in excess of our cumulative equity in earnings and are accounted for as a return of investment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we had net cash outflows of $228.3 million, primarily as a result of $312.5 million in capital expenditures and $4.2 million in contributions to equity method investments. These cash outflows were offset, in part, by cash inflows of $60.5 million in proceeds from the sale of common units of NGL Energy, an equity method investee, and $27.7 million in distributions from equity method investments in excess of equity in earnings. Capital expenditures included the U.S. Liquids segment's projects including the Maurepas Pipeline project, our U.S. Gas segment's northern Oklahoma expansion projects and our Canada segment's Wapiti expansion. Distributions in excess of equity earnings represent cash distributions from White Cliffs and Glass Mountain in excess of our cumulative equity in earnings and are accounted for as a return of investment.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had net cash outflows of $45.0 million, primarily as a result of $1.3 billion of borrowings (offset by $1.8 billion of principal payments including the final HFOTCO payment), $350.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of Maurepas Pipeline Class B shares, $342.3 million of net proceeds from the issuance of SemGroup Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, partially offset by $148.5 million of dividends paid, $4.7 million of payments related to debt issuances and $2.9 million of distributions to noncontrolling interests related to the Maurepas Pipeline Class B shares.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we had net cash inflows of $315.3 million, primarily as a result of $1.5 billion of borrowings and assumption of HFOTCO indebtedness (offset by $1.1 billion of principal payments), partially offset by $129.9 million of dividends paid, $16.3 million of debt extinguishment costs and $11.1 million of payments related to debt issuances. Debt extinguishment costs related to the early payoff of our 2021 Notes. Debt issuance costs primarily related to the issuance of our 2025 and 2026 Notes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we had net cash inflows of $75.9 million, primarily as a result of $382.5 million of borrowings (offset by $396.9 million of principal payments) and $223.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of common shares (net of offering costs), partially offset by $92.9 million of dividends paid, $32.1 million of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests and $7.7 million of payments related to debt issuances. Debt issuance costs primarily relate to the increase in capacity under the SemGroup credit facility.\nLong-term Debt\nSemGroup Senior Unsecured Notes\nAt December 31, 2018, we had outstanding $400 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2022, $350 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2023, $325 million of 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2025 and $300 million of 7.250% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (collectively, the \"Notes\"). The Notes are governed by indentures, as supplemented, between the Company and its subsidiary guarantors and Wilmington Trust, N.A., as trustee (the Indentures\u201d). The Indentures include customary covenants and events of default.\nAt December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the terms of the Indentures.\nSemGroup Revolving Credit Facility\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $119.5 million of cash borrowings outstanding under our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility. In addition, we had $24.3 million in outstanding letters of credit on that date. The maximum letter of credit capacity under this facility is $250 million. The facility can be increased up to $300 million with the consent of the administrative agent. The credit agreement expires on March 15, 2021.\nThe credit agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on the creation of new indebtedness, liens, sale and lease-back transactions, new investments, making fundamental changes including mergers and consolidations, making of dividends and other distributions, making material changes in our business, modifying certain documents and maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio, a senior secured leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. In addition, the credit agreement prohibits any commodity transactions that are not permitted by our Risk Governance Policies.\nThe terms of our credit facility restrict, to some extent, the payment of cash dividends on our common stock. The credit agreement is guaranteed by all of our wholly-owned, material domestic subsidiaries and secured by a lien on substantially all of our property and assets, subject to customary exceptions.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had available borrowing capacity of $856.2 million under this facility.\nHFOTCO Credit Agreement\nOn June 26, 2018, HFOTCO and Buffalo Gulf Coast Terminals LLC (\"BGCT\") entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement (the Amendment and Restatement Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Amendment and Restatement Agreement, the HFOTCO credit agreement was amended and restated in its entirety (as so amended and restated, the Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement\u201d).\nThe Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement increased the aggregate term loans incurred thereunder to $600 million, terminated the HFOTCO $75.0 million revolving credit facility, and extended the maturity date of the term loans to June 26, 2025 (the Maturity Date\u201d). In addition, HFOTCO may incur additional term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of $120 million and a measure of HFOTCO's EBITDA, defined in the credit agreement, at the time of determination, plus additional amounts subject to satisfaction of certain leverage-based criteria, subject to receiving commitments for such additional term loans from either new lenders or increased commitments from existing lenders. The term loan B was issued at a discount of $1.5 million.\nAt HFOTCO's option, the term loans will bear interest at the Eurodollar rate or an alternate base rate ( ABR\u201d), plus, in each case, an applicable margin of 2.75% relating to any term loans accruing interest at the Eurodollar rate and 1.75% relating to term loans accruing interest at ABR.\nThe Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement includes customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, which were made only for the purposes of the Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement and as of the specific date (or dates) set forth therein, and may be subject to certain limitations as agreed upon by the contracting parties, and apply only to BGCT, HFOTCO and any subsidiaries of HFOTCO party to the Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement. Such limitations include the creation of new liens, indebtedness, making of certain restricted payments and payments on indebtedness, making certain dispositions, making material changes in business activities, making fundamental changes including liquidations, mergers or consolidations, making certain investments, entering into certain transactions with affiliates, making amendments to material agreements, modifying the fiscal year, dealing with hazardous materials in certain ways, entering into certain hedging arrangements, entering into certain restrictive agreements, and funding or engaging in sanctioned activities.\nThe Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including events of default relating to inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect when made or when deemed made, non-payment of principal and other amounts owing under the Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement, including, in respect of, violation of covenants, cross acceleration to any material indebtedness of BGCT, HFOTCO and its subsidiaries, bankruptcy and insolvency events, certain unsatisfied judgments, certain ERISA events, certain invalidities of loan documents and the occurrence of a change of control. A default under the Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement would permit the participating banks to require immediate repayment of any outstanding loans with interest and any unpaid accrued fees, and subject to intercreditor arrangements with the holders of the HFOTCO tax exempt notes payable, exercise other rights and remedies.\nHFOTCO acquisition final payment\nOn April 17, 2018, we made the final payment related to the HFOTCO acquisition in the amount of $579.6 million. The payment was funded through revolving credit facility borrowings and cash on hand.\nSemCAMS Midstream\nOn February 25, 2019, SemCAMS Midstream entered into a credit agreement providing for a C$350.0 million senior secured term loan facility and a C$450.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility. For additional information, refer to Note 26 of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K.\nShelf Registration Statement\nWe have access to a universal shelf registration statement which provides us the ability to offer and sell an unlimited amount of debt and equity securities, subject to market conditions and our capital needs. This shelf registration statement expires in March 2019 and we intend to file a new universal shelf registration statement in March 2019.\nWe have also established an \"at the market\" offering program under the existing shelf registration statement, which provides for the offer and sale, from time to time, of common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $300 million. We are able to make sales in transactions at prices which are prevailing market prices at the time of sale, prices related to market prices or at negotiated prices. Such sales may be made pursuant to an Equity Distribution Agreement between us and certain agents who may act as sales agents or purchase for their own accounts as principals. To date, there have been no such sales.\nCapital Requirements\nThe midstream energy business can be capital intensive, requiring significant investment for the maintenance of existing assets or acquisition or development of new systems and facilities. We categorize our capital expenditures as either:\n \u2022 expansion capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long-term; or \n \u2022 maintenance capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures (including expenditures for the addition or improvement to, or the replacement of, our capital assets or for the acquisition of existing, or the construction or development of new, capital assets) made to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity.  During the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $390.7 million (cash basis), on capital projects. Projected capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, for 2019 are estimated at $262 million in expansion projects, including capital contributions to equity method investees to fund growth projects and $45 million in maintenance projects. These estimates may change as future events unfold. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nIn addition to our budgeted capital program, we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expansion capital expenditures in the future. Consequently, our ability to develop and maintain sources of funds to meet our capital requirements is critical to our ability to meet our growth objectives. We expect that our future expansion capital expenditures will be funded by cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities and the issuance of debt and equity securities.\nSemGroup Dividends\nThe table below sets out the dividends declared and/or paid by SemGroup for the periods indicated.\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Record Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dividend Per Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 7, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 17, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.45\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 15, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 26, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.45\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 18, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 28, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.45\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 20, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.45\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 9, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 19, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.4725\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 16, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 25, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.4725\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 20, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 28, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.4725\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 16, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 26, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.4725\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 4, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 14, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.4725\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn January 19, 2018, we sold to certain institutional investors, in a private placement, an aggregate of 350,000 shares of our Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Preferred Stock\u201d), convertible into shares of our Class A common stock. Holders of the Preferred Stock will receive quarterly distributions equal to an annual rate of 7.0% ($70.00 per share annualized) of $1,000 per share of Preferred Stock, subject to certain adjustments. With respect to any quarter ending on or prior to June 30, 2020, we may elect, in lieu of paying a distribution in cash, to have the amount that would have been payable if such dividend had been paid in cash added to the Liquidation Preference.\nOn February 20, 2019, we declared a dividend, in the aggregate, of $6.4 million to the holders of Preferred Stock. We elected to have the $6.4 million, that would have been paid in cash as a dividend, added to the liquidation preference of such shares as a payment-in-kind. The payment-in-kind on the shares of Preferred Stock is March 1, 2019, and the record date is February 22, 2019.\nCredit Risk\nWe are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. We examine the creditworthiness of third-party customers to whom we extend credit and manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions, we may request letters of credit, prepayments or guarantees.\nCustomer Concentration\nShell Trading (US) Company, a customer of our U.S. Liquids segment, accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, at approximately 26%. The contracts from which our revenues are derived from this customer primarily relate to our crude marketing operations and are for crude oil purchases and sales at market prices. We are not substantially dependent on such contracts and believe that if we were to lose any or all of these contracts, they could be readily replaced under substantially similar terms. Although we have contracts with customers of varying durations, if one or more of our major customers were to default on their contract, or if we were unable to renew our contract with one or more of these customers on favorable terms, we might not be able to replace any of these customers in a timely fashion, on favorable terms or at all. In any of these situations, our revenues and our ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected. We expect our exposure to risk of non-payment or non-performance to continue as long as we remain substantially dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues.\nOur U.S. Gas segment has a significant concentration of producers which account for a large portion of our U.S. Gas segment's volumes. During the year ended December 31, 2018, three producers accounted for approximately 89% of our total processed volumes. During the year ended December 31, 2018, two producers accounted for 83% of our total gathered volumes. Additionally, all of the gathering and processing volumes from these customers are produced in the Northern Oklahoma region.\nOur Canada segment's processing plants require a minimum rate of sulfur tonnage to operate and to comply with the regulatory requirements for air emissions. We have several large producers that provide significant sour gas to our plants. If these producers shut in their sour gas production due to current or future commodity prices, it could result in regulatory non-compliance, as well as operating and financial impacts to our Canada segment. We expect to mitigate this risk for our KA plant through a sulfur turn-down project that was placed into service in 2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Item 303 of Regulation S-K.\nCommitments\nContractual Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of business we enter into various contractual obligations for varying terms and amounts. The following table includes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, and our best estimate of the period in which the obligation will be settled (in thousands):\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>406,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>356,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,417,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (1)\n</td> <td>132,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>328,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>5,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Take-or-pay commitments (2)\n</td> <td>31,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments (3)\n</td> <td>981,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditure expansion projects\n</td> <td>104,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,261,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>172,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>277,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>543,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>474,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,793,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Assumes interest rates, fee rates and letters of credit and loans outstanding as of December 31, 2018, and that same remain constant thereafter until maturity except for required principal payments. \n (2) Take-or-pay commitments include: (a) a five-year transportation take-or-pay agreement with White Cliffs for approximately 5,000 barrels per day which began in October 2015; (b) a seven-year transportation take-or-pay agreement for 5,000 barrels per day on a third-party pipeline which began in June 2017; and (c) a commitment related to fractionation of natural gas liquids through 2023. \n (3) The bulk of the commitments shown in the table above relate to agreements to purchase product from a counterparty and to sell a similar amount of product (in a different location) to the same counterparty. Many of the commitments shown in the table above are cancellable by either party, as long as notice is given within the time frame specified in the agreement (generally 30 to 120 days).  In addition to the items in the table above, we have entered into various operational commitments and agreements related to pipeline operations and to the marketing, transportation, terminalling and storage of petroleum products. We have also entered into certain derivative instruments. See Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K.\nLetters of Credit\nIn connection with our purchasing activities, we provide certain suppliers and transporters with irrevocable standby letters of credit to secure our obligation for the purchase of petroleum products. Our liabilities with respect to these purchase obligations are recorded as accounts payable on our balance sheet in the month the petroleum products are purchased. Generally, these letters of credit are issued for 70-day periods (with a maximum of 364-day periods) and are terminated upon completion of each transaction. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $43.4 million and $110.8 million, respectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects and legal and regulatory challenges. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed.\nOn an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable. Actual results may differ substantially from our estimates. Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K. We identify our critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounting Policy\n</td> <td>Judgment/Uncertainty Affecting Application\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Taxes\n</td> <td>Ability to withstand legal challenges of tax authority decisions or appeals\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Anticipated future decisions of tax authorities\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Application of tax statutes and regulations to transactions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Ability to use tax benefits carry forwards to future periods\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Other Intangible Assets\n</td> <td>Recoverability of investment through future operations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Regulatory and political environments and requirements\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimated useful lives of assets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Environmental obligations and operational limitations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Identification of asset groups\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimates of future cash flows\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimates of fair value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Judgment about triggering events and held-for-sale classification\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill\n</td> <td>Judgment about impairment triggering events\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Identification of reporting units\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Purchase price allocation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimates of reporting unit's fair value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative Instruments\n</td> <td>Instruments used in valuation techniques\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Market maturity and economic conditions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Contract interpretation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Market conditions in the energy industry, especially the effects of price volatility on contractual commitments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingencies\n</td> <td>Estimated financial impact of event\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Judgment about the likelihood of event occurring\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Regulatory and political environments and requirements\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nAt December 31, 2018, we had a cumulative U.S. federal net operating loss of approximately $535.6 million that can be carried forward to apply against taxable income generated in future years. $350.4 million of this carryforward has an indefinite carryforward period and the remaining carryforward begins to expire in 2031. We had cumulative U.S. state net operating losses of approximately $371.0 million available for carryforward, which begin to expire in 2019. We had foreign net operating losses of $0.8 million available for carryforward, which begin to expire in 2025. We had foreign tax credits of approximately $44.6 million available for carryforward, which begin to expire in 2020. We had interest expense limitation of $31.8 million available for indefinite carryforward.\nConsiderable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws. We are subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions including Canada.\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Assets and Other Intangible Assets for Impairment\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment\u201d and ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d, we evaluate property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators are:\n \u2022 significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset; \n \u2022 significant adverse change in the manner an asset is used or its physical condition; \n \u2022 adverse business climate; \n \u2022 accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset; \n \u2022 current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and \n \u2022 change in our intent about an asset from an intent to hold such asset through the end of its estimated useful life to a greater than fifty percent likelihood that such asset will be disposed of before then.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows. However, actual future market prices and costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates and the impact of such variations could be material.\nGoodwill\nWe apply ASC 805, Business Combinations,\u201d and ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,\u201d to account for goodwill. In accordance with these standards, goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. However, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We test for impairment at the reporting unit level using three valuation approaches: first, the income approach which measures the value of an asset by the present value of its future economic benefit; second, the market approach which measures the value of an asset through the analysis of recent sales or offerings of comparable properties; and third, the cost approach which measures the value of an asset by the cost to reconstruct or replace it with another of like utility.\nEstimation of future economic benefit requires management to make assumptions about numerous variables including selling prices, costs, the level of activity and appropriate discount rates. When goodwill balances are material, such as with our HFOTCO acquisition, relatively minor revisions to assumptions could result in a material future impairment. If it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, our goodwill will be impaired at that time.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe follow the guidance of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging,\u201d to account for derivative instruments. ASC 815 requires us to mark-to-market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet, and recognize changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments immediately in earnings. In certain cases, we may apply hedge accounting to our derivative instruments. The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are: (i) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure; (ii) whether the overall risk is being reduced; and (iii) if there is a correlation between the fair value of the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments accounted for as hedges are either recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the related hedged item, or deferred and recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur.\nCertain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered to be a normal purchase normal sale ( NPNS\u201d). The availability of this exception is based on the assumption that the company has the ability, and it is probable, to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item. These assumptions are based on internal forecasts of sales and historical physical delivery on contracts. Derivatives that are considered to be NPNS are exempt from derivative accounting treatment and are accounted for under accrual accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with immediate recognition through earnings.\nContingencies\nWe record a loss contingency when management determines that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. Gain contingencies are not recorded until realized.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K.\n ", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe, and our significant equity method investee, own gathering systems, transportation pipelines, crude oil transport trucks, processing plants, storage facilities and terminals in Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming and in Alberta, Canada.\nGeneral Trends and Outlook\nThe prices of crude oil and natural gas have historically been volatile. For example, from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2018, the NYMEX prompt month settle price ranged from a high of $107.26 per barrel to a low of $26.21 per barrel. The range for natural gas during that period was $6.15 to $1.64 per MMBtu. Substantial declines in crude oil and natural gas prices, particularly prolonged declines, can have negative effects on producers including:\n\u2022reduced revenue, operating income and cash flows;\n\u2022reduced volume of crude oil and natural gas that can be produced economically;\n\u2022delayed or postponed capital projects; and/or\n\u2022limited access to or increased cost of capital, such as equity and long-term debt.\nThe substantial declines in crude oil and natural gas prices since mid-2014 and continuing throughout 2018 have had these effects on a number of companies in the oil and gas industry, including our customers. While we do not have significant direct exposure to commodity prices, we are exposed to a reduction in volumes to be transported, stored, gathered, processed and marketed as a result of lower prices. Additionally, changes to price differentials between basins also impact our crude oil marketing operations. We were impacted by these factors in 2018 and expect them to continue in 2019.\nWe continue to execute on our de-leveraging strategy. We have pre-funded capital growth projects and reduced debt leverage through the issuance of subsidiary preferred equity representing a 49% interest in Maurepas Pipeline for $350 million in November of 2018 and our 2019 contribution of our Canadian business to a joint venture with KKR which returned $484 million of cash to SemGroup. We own a 51% interest in the joint venture which subsequently acquired Meritage Midstream ULC and its midstream infrastructure assets for approximately $490 million. The transaction closed on February 25, 2019.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance. We view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and review these measurements on at least a monthly basis for consistency and trend analysis. These metrics include financial measures such as operating expenses, Segment Profit and Adjusted EBITDA and operating data including contracted storage capacity and sales, transportation and processing volumes.\nOperating Expenses\nOur management seeks to maximize the profitability of our operations, in part, by minimizing operating expenses. These expenses are comprised of salary and wage expense, utility costs, insurance premiums, taxes and other operating costs, some of which are independent of the volumes we handle.\nSegment Profit\nOur management analyzes the performance of our operating segments through our segment profit measure which is defined as revenue, less cost of products sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and operating expenses, plus equity earnings and is adjusted to remove unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and to reflect equity earnings on an EBITDA basis. Reflecting equity earnings on an EBITDA basis is achieved by adjusting equity earnings to exclude our percentage of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from equity earnings for operated equity method investees. For our investment in NGL Energy, we exclude equity earnings and include cash distributions received.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization and adjusted for selected items that we believe impact the comparability of financial results between reporting periods. In addition to non-cash items, we have selected items for adjustment to EBITDA which management feels decrease the comparability of our results among periods. These items are identified as those which are generally outside of the results of day-to-day operations of the business. These items are not considered non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, but do erode comparability among periods in which they occur with periods in which they do not occur or occur to a greater or lesser degree.\nHistorically, we have selected items such as gains on the sale of NGL Energy common units, costs related to our predecessor's bankruptcy, significant business development related costs, significant legal settlements, severance and other similar costs. Management believes these types of items can make comparability of the results of day to day operations among periods difficult and have chosen to remove these items from our Adjusted EBITDA. We expect to adjust for similar types of items in the future. Although we present selected items that we consider in evaluating our performance, you should be aware that the items presented do not represent all items that affect comparability between the periods presented. Variations in our operating results are also caused by changes in volumes, prices, mechanical interruptions and numerous other factors. We do not adjust for these types of variances.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to assess:\n \u2022 our operating performance as compared to that of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis, capital structure or the impact of fluctuating commodity prices; and \n \u2022 the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.  Note About Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations.\nNet income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing the utility.\nManagement compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable GAAP measure, understanding the difference between Adjusted EBITDA and net income (loss) and incorporating this knowledge into its decision-making processes. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a historical basis for each of the periods indicated.\n\nBusiness and Performance Drivers\nWe operate our core businesses through three business segments: U.S. Liquids, U.S. Gas and Canada. We generate revenue in these segments by using our assets to provide products and services to third parties and by selectively using our assets to support our marketing activities.\nCertain factors are key to our operations. These include the safe, reliable and efficient operation of the pipelines and facilities that we own and operate, while meeting the regulations that govern the operation of our assets and the costs associated with such regulations.\nRevenue\nOur revenue is generated through the gathering, transportation, processing and storage of petroleum products. Our customers pay us fees based on volumes gathered, transported, processed and stored. We also generate revenue by marketing petroleum products.\nWe may use futures, swaps and options contracts to manage our exposure to market changes in commodity prices, to protect our gross margins on our purchased petroleum products and to manage our liquidity risk associated with margin deposit requirements on our overall derivative positions. When purchasing petroleum products, we seek to manage our exposure to commodity price risk. As we purchase inventory from suppliers, we may establish a fixed or variable margin with future sales using one of the following methods:\n \u2022 we have already sold that product for physical delivery pursuant to sales contracts at a market index price, \n \u2022 we sell the product for future physical delivery pursuant to effectively back-to-back sales contracts, or \n \u2022 we enter into futures and swaps contracts on the NYMEX or over the counter markets.  In addition, we may purchase put options or derivatives other than futures or swaps to hedge our inventory of petroleum products prior to our sale of such inventory.\nVolumes\nGenerally, we expect revenue to increase or decrease in conjunction with increases or decreases in total volumes. Our total volumes are affected by various factors, including our physical storage or transportation capacity, our working capital and credit availability under our credit facilities to support petroleum product purchases and the availability of the supply of petroleum product available for purchase, which is determined based primarily upon producer activity in areas near our asset base.\nCommodity Prices\nOur business is primarily fee based. As a result, our financial results are typically not directly correlated with increases and decreases in commodity prices. Our financial results, however, are positively correlated with the absolute difference between current (prompt) and future month petroleum product prices. That is, wide contango (when the prices for future deliveries are higher than current prices) spreads generally have a favorable impact on our results relative to a slightly contango, flat or backwardated (when the prices for future deliveries are lower than current prices) market. While we do not have significant direct exposure to commodity prices, we are exposed to reductions in volumes transported, stored, gathered, processed and marketed as a result of lower prices. Additionally, changes to price differentials between basins also impact our crude oil marketing operations.\nTiming of Purchase and Sales\nOur financial results are affected by the timing of the purchase and sale of petroleum products, such that financial results may not be comparable between periods. When we enter into an arrangement to purchase product, place the product in storage and resell the product in the future, our financial results do not reflect any related margin until the settlement of the product sale. Prior to the settlement of the product sale, our results reflect the cost of the product in our inventory. Differences in the timing of our product purchases and sales, especially if they extend over fiscal years or quarters, may result in sizable differences between our results over the comparable period.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n\nRevenue, costs of products sold and operating expenses\nRevenue, costs of products sold and operating expenses are analyzed by operating segment below.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased in 2018 to $91.6 million from $113.8 million in 2017. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in acquisition related costs, the disposition of our U.K. and Mexican businesses in early 2018 and full year of expense related to our HFOTCO acquisition, which was acquired in July of 2017. Current year acquisition related costs are $2.7 million compared with $22.0 million in the prior year, primarily due to the HFOTCO acquisition. Our U.K. and Mexican businesses incurred a combined $4.1 million of general and administrative expense in the current year prior to their disposals compared with a combined $16.0 million in the prior year. The decreases in general and administrative expense were offset by an increase of $7.8 million from the prior year for the HFOTCO business as a result of a full year of operations in 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased in 2017 to $113.8 million from $84.2 million in 2016 primarily due to $26 million of HFOTCO related costs, of which $22 million were acquisition related costs. General and administrative costs for Canada increased by $3 million compared to prior year primarily due to employment costs, office costs and an increase in foreign exchange rates between periods.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization costs increased in 2018 to $209.3 million from $158.4 million in 2017, primarily due to a full year of depreciation and amortization from the HFOTCO acquisition and the Maurepas Pipeline which was placed in service in 2017 and other projects placed in-service during the period, partially offset by the disposition of our U.K. and Mexican businesses. The increase due to HFOTCO was $38.0 million, the increase due to the Maurepas Pipeline was $14.9 million and the decrease due to the U.K. and Mexican business dispositions was $11.7 million.\nDepreciation and amortization costs increased in 2017 to $158.4 million from $98.8 million in 2016, of which $44 million related to the HFOTCO assets including finite-lived intangible assets acquired in July 2017. The Maurepas Pipeline which was placed in service in 2017 accounted for $11 million of the increase. The remaining increase relates to smaller projects placed in-service during the period.\nLoss (gain) on disposal or impairment, net\nIn 2018 we had a net gain on disposal or impairment of $3.6 million. The net gain was primarily a result of small gains due to the finalization of the sales of our U.K. and Mexican businesses and a post-closing adjustment of $1.4 million related to the disposal of Glass Mountain in 2017.\nLoss on disposal or impairment, net in 2017 was $13.3 million. The net loss on disposal or impairment in 2017 was due to the following (in thousands):\n\nThe write-downs of the Mexican asphalt business and the U.K. operations to net realizable value was due to the businesses being categorized as held-for-sale at December 31, 2017.\nThe impairment of our Sherman, Texas natural gas gathering and processing assets was due to the evaluation of capital raising alternatives which indicated that the carrying value of our Sherman, Texas assets might be in excess of fair value. We used an income approach, based on a discounted cash flow model, to estimate the fair value of the assets, which resulted in a non-cash impairment.\nThe impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of our crude oil trucking business was due to a reduction in the long range forecast for crude oil trucking due to the on-going challenging business environment. We viewed the decrease in the forecast as a triggering event that indicated a potential impairment and performed an interim impairment analysis on the business unit's assets including goodwill and intangible assets.\nWe performed a recoverability test of our definite lived assets under ASC 360 whereby we compared the undiscounted cash flows of the asset group, which was determined to be the entire crude oil trucking reporting unit and included goodwill, to the carrying value of the assets at September 30, 2017. This test indicated that the assets were not fully recoverable. Therefore, we estimated the fair value of the definite lived assets using an income approach, supplemented by a market approach to measure impairment. We also performed an interim impairment test of our goodwill associated with the crude oil trucking reporting unit and determined the estimated fair value was less than the adjusted carrying value of the reporting unit resulting in impairment of goodwill. The cash flow models used to determine recoverability of our assets and to measure impairment expense involved using significant judgments and assumptions, which included the discount rate, anticipated revenue and volume growth rates, estimated operating expenses and capital expenditures, which were based on our operating and capital budgets as well as our strategic plans. We considered the market approach by comparing the revenue and earnings multiples implied by our income approach to those of comparable companies for reasonableness and for estimating the fair value of certain assets of our reporting unit.\nThe gain on the sale of Glass Mountain is due to the December 22, 2017 sale of our ownership interest in Glass Mountain for $300 million, subject to working capital and other adjustments.\nLoss on disposal or impairment, net in 2016 was primarily due to a $13.1 million impairment of U.S. Gas goodwill as a result of producer forecast reductions following the release of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission's Regional Earthquake Response Plan which curtailed the amount of volume that can be injected into disposal wells.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased in 2018 to $149.7 million from $103.0 million in 2017. The increase is primarily the result of a net increase of $15.2 million related to the $300 million, 7.25% senior unsecured notes sold in September 2017, the $325 million, 6.375% senior unsecured notes sold in March 2017, and the early payoff of $300 million, 7.50% senior unsecured notes sold in March 2017. There was a $22.1 million increase in HFOTCO bank interest due to a full year of interest in 2018 compared to only six months interest in 2017. These net increases were offset by a net decrease in capitalized interest of $5.8 million due to fewer U.S. projects in 2018 and the initial on-line operations of the Maurepas Pipeline, offset slightly by increased projects in Canada.\nInterest increased in 2017 to $103.0 million from $62.7 million in 2016. The increase is primarily the result of $28.4 million related to HFOTCO debt subsequent to acquisition including accretion of the final payment, $22.8 million attributable to the new $325 million, 6.375% senior unsecured notes sold in March 2017 and the $300 million, 7.25% senior unsecured notes sold in September 2017 and $8.6 million due to increased borrowings on SemGroup's revolving credit facility. These increases were offset by a $17.8 million decrease in interest expense due to the early payoff of $300 million, 7.50% senior unsecured notes in March 2017.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased $290 million of our outstanding $300 million senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the 2021 Notes\u201d) through a tender offer. The price included a premium and interest to the purchase date. A notice of redemption was issued for the remaining $10 million of 2021 Notes, which were not redeemed through the tender offer pursuant to the redemption and satisfaction and discharge provisions of the indenture governing the 2021 Notes. The redemption price includes a redemption premium and interest to the redemption date. As a result, we recognized a loss of $19.9 million on the early extinguishment of the 2021 Notes, which included premiums of $15.9 million and the write off of $3.6 million of associated unamortized debt issuance costs.\nForeign currency transaction loss (gain)\nForeign currency transaction changed to a loss of $9.5 million in 2018 from a gain of $4.7 million in 2017. The change is primarily due to realized and unrealized losses of $10.2 million on foreign currency forwards for purchases of Canadian dollars to limit exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations for capital contributions to our Canadian operations compared with $2.8 million of realized and unrealized gains in the prior year. The remaining change is primarily due to foreign currency changes related to U.S. dollar denominated payables of our U.K. business which was sold in early 2018.\nForeign currency transaction changed to a gain of $4.7 million in 2017 from a loss of $4.8 million in 2016. The change is primarily due to changes in the foreign currency rates and amounts of U.S. dollar denominated payables of our U.K. business compared to the prior year and $2.8 million of realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency forwards entered into in the fourth quarter of 2017. The forwards are for purchases of Canadian dollars to limit exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations for capital contributions to our Canadian operations.\nLoss on sale or impairment of non-operated equity method investment\nIn 2016, we incurred a $30.6 million loss due to a $39.8 million other-than-temporary impairment recorded on our NGL Energy common units, partially offset by a $9.1 million gain on the sale of remaining NGL Energy common units in 2016.\nResults of Operations by Reporting Segment\nU.S. Liquids\n\n\n2018 versus 2017\nRevenues\nProduct sales increased in 2018 to $1.7 billion from $1.3 billion in 2017.\nGross product revenue increased in 2018 to $5.4 billion from $4.6 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the average sales price to $65 per barrel in 2018, from an average sales price of $50 per barrel in 2017, partially offset by a decrease in the volume sold to 83 million barrels in 2018 from 92 million barrels in 2017. Volumes decreased as compared to prior year due to fewer location trades.\nGross product revenue was reduced by $3.7 billion and $3.3 billion during 2018 and 2017, respectively, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 845-10-15, \"Nonmonetary Transactions,\" (\"ASC 845-10-15\"). ASC 845-10-15 requires that certain transactions -- those where inventory is purchased from a customer then resold to the same customer -- to be presented in the income statement on a net basis, resulting in a reduction of revenue and costs of products sold by the same amount.\nPipeline transportation revenue increased to $84.9 million in 2018 from $43.6 million in 2017, primarily due to an increase of $37.9 million, as a result of a full year of operations on the Maurepas Pipeline, and a $3.5 million increase on the WOT due to higher transportation volumes.\nTruck transportation revenue decreased to $23.6 million in 2018 from $31.4 million in 2017, due to lower transportation volumes.\nStorage revenue increased to $161.5 million in 2018 from $85.7 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $78.1 million reflecting a full year of HFOTCO operations, partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in crude storage compared to prior year, as the average capacity leased by storage customers decreased to 5.9 million barrels from 6.3 million barrels.\nFacility service fees increased to $49.9 million in 2018 from $27.7 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $26.2 million reflecting a full year of HFOTCO operations, partially offset by a $4.6 million decrease at Platteville as a result of lower truck unloading volumes.\nLease revenue increased to $17.5 million in 2018 from $5.8 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to a full year of HFOTCO operations.\nCost of Products Sold\nCosts of products sold increased in 2018 to $1.7 billion from $1.3 billion in 2017. The cost of products sold reflect reductions of $3.7 billion and $3.3 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively, in accordance with ASC 845-10-15. There was a decrease in the barrels sold, as described above, combined with an increase in the average per barrel cost of crude oil to $65 in 2018 from $50 in 2017.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2018 to $134.2 million from $99.3 million in 2017 due to a $35.9 million increase at HFOTCO reflecting a full year of operations, as well as other increases in insurance and taxes and maintenance and repair expense, partially offset by a decrease in outside services.\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Commodity Derivatives, net\nUnrealized gain (loss) on commodity derivatives, net increased in 2018 to a gain of $5.1 million from a loss of $40.0 thousand in 2017. The gain is due to open positions and changes in market prices in the current year.\nEarnings from Equity Method Investments\nEarnings from equity method investments decreased in 2018 to $57.6 million from $67.3 million in 2017. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of Glass Mountain and decreased earnings by White Cliffs of $7.5 million and $2.2 million, respectively.\n2017 versus 2016\nRevenue\nProduct sales increased in 2017 to $1.3 billion from $716.6 million in 2016.\nGross product revenue increased in 2017 to $4.6 billion from $3.1 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the volume sold to 92 million barrels at an average sales price of $50 per barrel in 2017, from the volume sold of 75 million barrels at an average sales price of $42 per barrel in 2016. Volumes increased as compared to prior year due to additional location trades.\nGross product revenue was reduced by $3.3 billion and $2.4 billion during 2017 and 2016, respectively, in accordance with ASC 845-10-15.\nPipeline transportation revenue increased to $43.6 million in 2017 from $23.1 million in 2016. The increase was primarily the result of $20.8 million related to the start-up of the Maurepas Pipeline and a $3.7 million increase on the WOT. These increases were partially offset by a $3.6 million reduction related to the Tampa Pipeline, that was sold in the first quarter of 2017.\nTruck transportation revenue decreased to $31.4 million in 2017 from $41.8 million in 2016, primarily as a result of slightly lower volumes and rates.\nStorage fee revenue increased in 2017 to $85.7 million from $27.7 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to the 2017 acquisition of HFOTCO resulting in $60.5 million of revenue, offset by a reduction in crude oil storage revenue of\n$2.2 million, mainly resulting from scheduled tank cleanings, as the average capacity leased by storage customers decreased to 6.2 million barrels from 6.6 million barrels. The remainder is due to decreases in pump-over revenue of $0.7 million, third-party unloading revenue of $0.3 million and other revenue of $0.2 million.\nFacility service fees increased to $27.7 million in 2017 from $18.3 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $10.6 million reflecting the 2017 acquisition of HFOTCO, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease at Platteville as a result of lower truck unloading volumes.\nCosts of Products Sold\nCosts of products sold increased in 2017 to $1.3 billion from $652.4 million in 2016. The cost of products sold reflects reductions of $3.3 billion and $2.4 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively, in accordance with ASC 845-10-15. There was an increase in the barrels sold, as described above, combined with an increase in the average per barrel cost of crude oil to $50 in 2017 from $41 in 2016.\nThe increase in cost of products sold outpaced the increase in revenue leading to a decrease in segment profit of $31.8 million as compared to the prior year. This is primarily due to lower blending margins of $8.2 million due to increased competition at Cushing, lower contango margins of $5.8 million, increased pipeline transportation fees of $8.2 million related to firm commitments beginning in June 2017 and increased truck transportation fees of $7.3 million related to increased volume.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2017 to $99.3 million from $82.8 million in 2016 due to a $15.3 million increase as a result of the acquisition of HFOTCO during 2017.\nU.S. Gas\n\n2018 versus 2017\nRevenues\nRevenues increased in 2018 to $265.3 million from $233.2 million in 2017. The increase is primarily due to higher volumes (134,135 MMcf in 2018 compared to 101,709 MMcf for 2017) and higher average NGL basket price of $0.86/gallon in 2018 versus $0.85/gallon in 2017. The increase was partially offset by lower average natural gas NYMEX price of $3.09/MMbtu in 2018 versus $3.11/MMbtu in 2017. Volume increases are primarily due to Stack production, offset by reduced Mississippi Lime drilling, coupled with natural well production declines.\nGathering and processing fee revenue increased in 2018 to $54.5 million from $52.6 million in 2017. In the current year, certain fees are reported as gathering and processing fee revenue under ASU 2016-15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( ASC 606\u201d), whereas in the prior year these amounts were reported as reductions to cost of sales under ASC 605. The current year includes $15.0 million of fee revenue which would have been included as a reduction to cost of sales under the prior year methodology. Exclusive of the impact of ASC 606, fee revenue decreased by $13.1 million due lower product recovery fees and unfavorable contract mix, partially offset by higher volumes.\nCost of Products Sold\nCost of products sold increased in 2018 to $165.5 million from $135.7 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher NGL prices, the impact of ASC 606 discussed above, offset by lower Mississippi Lime volumes and lower natural gas prices.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased slightly in 2018 to $32.7 million from $29.7 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to compression overhauls, turbine maintenance, and employee costs.\n2017 versus 2016\nRevenue\nRevenue increased in 2017 to $233.2 million from $219.0 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a higher average natural gas NYMEX price of $3.108/MMbtu in 2017 versus $2.46/MMbtu in 2016, a higher average NGL basket price of $0.85/gallon in 2017 versus $0.65/gallon in 2016, and increased fees of $53 million in 2017 versus $52 million in 2016 due to higher rates. The increase was offset, in part, by lower volume (101,709 million cubic feet in 2017 versus 116,748 million cubic feet in 2016).\nCosts of Products Sold\nCosts of products sold increased in 2017 to $135.7 million from $120.5 million in 2016. The increase was attributable to higher prices and was offset, in part, by lower volume processed in northern Oklahoma.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense decreased in 2017 to $29.7 million from $31.9 million in 2016. This decrease was due to lower equipment lease, field expense (which includes materials and supplies, lubricants, water disposal, electricity and fuel), maintenance/repair, and office expense. All decreases are primarily driven by lower volume in northern Oklahoma. These decreases were offset by increases in employment, outside services, taxes, and other expenses.\nCanada\n\n2018 versus 2017\nRevenue\nRevenue increased in 2018 to $193.1 million from $183.2 million in 2017. This increase is primarily due to higher operating costs recoveries of $5.2 million, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between periods of $1.7 million and higher gathering and processing revenue of $1.3 million. These increases were offset, in part, by true-ups of take-or-pay minimum volumes commitments of $3.6 million. Further, a 31-day planned outage at the KA plant in 2018 decreased gathering and processing revenue by $2.2 million. This was offset by the 2017 planned outage at the K3 plant which decreased gathering and processing revenue by $2.5 million.\nAdditionally, subsequent to the adoption of ASC 606, we recognized $4.5 million of revenue, to recognize certain deficiencies on take-or-pay agreements for which there is a contractual make-up period. Under ASC 605, revenue related to\ndeficiencies with a make-up period was deferred until the contractual right to make up a deficiency expired. Under ASC 606, we can recognize all or a portion of revenue related to deficiencies before the make-up period expires if we determine that it is probable that the customer will not make-up all or some of its deficient volumes, for example if there is insufficient capacity to make up the deficient volumes in future periods.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2018 to $111.5 million from $106.8 million in 2017. This increase is primarily due to turnaround costs related to the KA plant of $25.6 million, higher power costs of $5.0 million, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates between periods of $1.4 million. These increases were offset, in part, by turnaround costs in 2017 for the K3 plant of $27.2 million.\n2017 versus 2016\nRevenue\nRevenue increased in 2017 to $183.2 million from $133.2 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to higher operating cost recoveries of $27.6 million (primarily attributable to the K3 plant turnaround), higher gathering and processing revenue of $4.7 million, non-recurring 2016 fee concessions of $4.6 million, true-up of take-or-pay minimum volumes commitments of $4.4 million and changes in foreign currency exchange rates between periods of $3.1 million.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in 2017 to $106.8 million from $79.8 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to turnaround costs related to the K3 plant, offset by lower contractor costs of $4.1 million.\nCorporate and Other\n\nCorporate and Other is not an operating segment. This table is included to permit the reconciliation of segment information to that of the consolidated Company. The amounts reported for the year ended December 31, 2016 above have been recast to include our former U.K. and Mexico segments which, subsequent to our acquisition of HFOTCO, were no longer expected to be significant for separate presentation. The main activities of our U.K. operations were the receipt, storage and redelivery of clean petroleum and crude oil products via sea-going vessels. Our U.K. revenue was based on fixed-fee storage tank leases and related services. Revenue from our Mexico operations was based on contractual arrangements with customers for liquid asphalt cement. Our U.K. operations and Mexico operations were sold in 2018. Earnings from equity method investments in the table above relates to our investments in NGL Energy.\n2018 versus 2017\nThe decreases in revenues, cost of products sold and operating expenses are due to the disposal of our U.K. operations and Mexican asphalt business in early 2018 compared with a full year of operations for both entities in the prior year.\n2017 versus 2016\nRevenues\nThe increase in revenue relates primarily to higher revenues in our Mexico operations ($155 million in 2017 compared to $139 million in 2016), mostly due to higher product sales prices, partially offset by slightly lower volume and foreign exchange impacts between periods. Revenue in our U.K. operations increased to $28 million in 2017 compared to $25 million in 2016, primarily as a result of increased storage volume thereby creating increased throughput revenue and storage volume and price variances. The remaining change was primarily due to an increase in the intersegment eliminations which are reported in Corporate and Other. Intersegment revenues relate to product sales from our U.S. Gas segment to our U.S. Liquids segment.\nCosts of products sold\nThe increase in costs of products sold relates primarily to higher costs in Mexico ($131 million in 2017 compared to $111 million in 2016), as a result of higher unit costs in Mexico, partially offset by lower volume.\nEarnings from Equity Method Investments\nThe decrease in earnings from equity method investments is due to the sale of our limited partner interest in NGL Energy in April of 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOur principal sources of short-term liquidity are cash generated from our operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. The consolidated cash balance on December 31, 2018 was $86.7 million. Of this amount, $17.1 million was held in Canada and may be subject to tax if transferred to the U.S. Potential sources of long-term liquidity include issuances of debt securities and equity securities and the sale of assets. Our primary cash requirements currently are operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt payments and our quarterly dividends. In general, we expect to fund:\n \u2022 operating expenses, maintenance capital expenditures and cash dividends through existing cash and cash from operating activities; \n \u2022 expansion capital expenditures and any working capital deficits through cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities and the issuance of debt securities and equity securities; \n \u2022 acquisitions through cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities, the issuance of debt securities and equity securities and proceeds from the divestiture of assets or interests in assets; and \n \u2022 debt principal payments through cash from operating activities and refinancings when the credit facility becomes due.  Our ability to meet our financing requirements and fund our planned capital expenditures will depend on our future operating performance and distributions from our equity investments, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry. In addition, we are subject to conditions in the debt and equity markets for any issuances of debt securities and equity securities. There can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets in the future. If we would be unable or unwilling to access those markets, we could be required to restrict future cash outlays, such as expansion capital expenditures and potential future acquisitions.\nWe believe our cash from operations and our remaining borrowing capacity allow us to manage our day-to-day cash requirements, distribute our quarterly dividends and meet our capital expenditure commitments for the coming year.\nThe following table summarizes our changes in unrestricted cash for the periods presented:\n\nOperating Activities\nThe components of operating cash flows can be summarized as follows:\n\n2018 Compared to 2017\nAdjustments to net income for non-cash expenses increased to $248.2 million in 2018 from $190.6 million in 2017. Significant changes from prior year include:\n \u2022 $50.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to the HFOTCO acquisition and completion of the Maurepas Pipeline; \n \u2022 $18.1 million due to a deferred tax expense in the current year compared to deferred tax benefit in the prior year, primarily as a result of the change to the federal statutory income tax rate and other discrete tax items in 2017; \n \u2022 $14.2 million due to current year currency losses as compared to prior year currency gains primarily due to foreign currency forwards for purchases of Canadian dollars to limit exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations for capital contributions to our Canadian operations; \n \u2022 $9.7 million reduction in earnings from equity method investments due to the sale of Glass Mountain Pipeline in December 2017, as well as rate reductions on White Cliffs Pipeline partially offset by higher volumes; \n \u2022 $4.7 million increase in write-downs of inventory to net realizable value; \n \u2022 $3.0 million due to a pension curtailment gain related to the HFOTCO pension which was curtailed subsequent to acquisition in the prior year; \n \u2022 $1.4 million amortization of debt costs; and \n \u2022 $1.3 million non-cash equity compensation.  These increases to the adjustments to net income for non-cash expenses, net were offset by decreases due to:\n \u2022 a decrease of $19.9 million in loss on the early extinguishment of our 2021 Notes in the prior year; \n \u2022 a decrease of $16.9 million in losses on disposal and impairments primarily due to small current year gains from the finalization of the sales of our U.K. and Mexican businesses and a post-closing adjustment related to our Glass Mountain disposal compared to prior year gain on disposal of Glass Mountain offset by impairments \nrelated to the held for sale status of our Mexican asphalt business and our U.K. operations and impairments to U.S. Gas and U.S. Liquids assets; and\n \u2022 a $9.1 million decrease in distributions from equity method investees primarily due to the disposition of Glass Mountain in the prior year.  Changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2018 relative to the prior year-end consisted primarily of:\n \u2022 a $52.2 million decrease in inventory due to a reduction in the number of barrels on hand and crude oil price declines compared to prior year end; \n \u2022 a $79.3 million decrease in accounts receivable, including receivable from affiliates, generally due to timing of sales and changes in commodity prices and volumes; \n \u2022 a $3.4 million increase in other current assets and a $1.6 million increase in other assets; and \n \u2022 a $82.0 million decrease in accounts payable, including payable to affiliates, and accrued liabilities generally due to timing of purchases and changes in commodity prices and volumes.  2017 Compared to 2016\nNon-cash expenses increased to $190.6 million in 2017 from $178.7 million in 2016. Significant changes from prior year include:\n \u2022 a $59.6 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to the HFOTCO acquisition; \n \u2022 a $19.9 million loss on the early extinguishment of our 2021 Notes in the current year; \n \u2022 a $6.4 million increase due to lower current year earnings from equity method investments as compared with the prior year primarily due to lower White Cliffs volumes and the prior year sale of our limited partner investment in NGL Energy;  These increases to non-cash adjustment to net income were offset by:\n \u2022 $30.6 million decrease due to the prior year other-than-temporary impairment recorded on our limited partner investment in NGL Energy, partially offset by prior year gain on the sale of our common limited partner units of NGL Energy; \n \u2022 a decrease of $18.3 million due to a deferred tax benefit in the current year compared to deferred tax expense in the prior year primarily as a result of changes to federal statutory income tax rates and a current year pre-tax loss compared with prior year pre-tax income; \n \u2022 a $9.7 million decrease in distributions from equity method investees primarily due to the disposition of our limited partner unit investment in NGL Energy in the prior year and lower volumes on White Cliffs; \n \u2022 a $9.5 million decrease due to currency gains as compared to prior year currency losses; \n \u2022 a $3.0 million decrease due to a pension curtailment gain related to the HFOTCO pension which was curtailed subsequent to acquisition; and \n \u2022 a decrease of $2.7 million in losses on disposal and impairments primarily due to gain on disposal of Glass Mountain offset by impairments related to the held for sale status of our Mexican asphalt business and our U.K. operations and impairments to U.S. Gas and U.S. Liquids assets.  Changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2017 relative to the prior year-end consisted primarily of:\n \u2022 $213.6 million increase in accounts receivable, including receivable from affiliates, generally due to higher commodity prices and volumes; \n \u2022 $17.9 million increase in inventory primarily due to increased inventory of our U.S. Liquids segment due to an additional 0.3 million barrels of crude oil on hand at a higher weighted average cost; \n \u2022 $190.4 million increase in accounts payable, including payable to affiliates, and accrued liabilities generally due to higher prices and volumes and timing of purchases; and \n \u2022 $19.4 million increase in other noncurrent liabilities primarily due to accretion of the final payment in the HFOTCO acquisition. \nInvesting Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had net cash outflows of $229.7 million, primarily as a result of $390.7 million in capital expenditures and $7.8 million in contributions to equity method investments. These cash outflows were offset, in part, by cash inflows of $147.8 million in proceeds from business divestitures and $19.1 million in distributions from equity method investments in excess of equity in earnings. Capital expenditures included our Canada segment's Wapiti expansion and our U.S. Liquids segment's expansion projects at our Gulf Coast terminal. Distributions in excess of equity earnings represent cash distributions from White Cliffs in excess of our cumulative equity in earnings and are accounted for as a return of investment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we had net cash outflows of $439.8 million, primarily as a result of $462.7 million in capital expenditures, $294.2 million cash paid as a portion of the first payment to acquire HFOTCO and $26.4 million in contributions to equity method investments. These cash outflows were offset, in part, by cash inflows of $314.8 million in proceeds from the sale of long-lived assets, primarily due to the Glass Mountain disposal, and $28.8 million in distributions from equity method investments in excess of equity in earnings. Capital expenditures included the U.S. Liquids segment's projects including the Maurepas Pipeline project, our U.S. Gas segment's northern Oklahoma expansion projects and our Canada segment's Wapiti expansion. Distributions in excess of equity earnings represent cash distributions from White Cliffs and Glass Mountain in excess of our cumulative equity in earnings and are accounted for as a return of investment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we had net cash outflows of $228.3 million, primarily as a result of $312.5 million in capital expenditures and $4.2 million in contributions to equity method investments. These cash outflows were offset, in part, by cash inflows of $60.5 million in proceeds from the sale of common units of NGL Energy, an equity method investee, and $27.7 million in distributions from equity method investments in excess of equity in earnings. Capital expenditures included the U.S. Liquids segment's projects including the Maurepas Pipeline project, our U.S. Gas segment's northern Oklahoma expansion projects and our Canada segment's Wapiti expansion. Distributions in excess of equity earnings represent cash distributions from White Cliffs and Glass Mountain in excess of our cumulative equity in earnings and are accounted for as a return of investment.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had net cash outflows of $45.0 million, primarily as a result of $1.3 billion of borrowings (offset by $1.8 billion of principal payments including the final HFOTCO payment), $350.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of Maurepas Pipeline Class B shares, $342.3 million of net proceeds from the issuance of SemGroup Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, partially offset by $148.5 million of dividends paid, $4.7 million of payments related to debt issuances and $2.9 million of distributions to noncontrolling interests related to the Maurepas Pipeline Class B shares.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we had net cash inflows of $315.3 million, primarily as a result of $1.5 billion of borrowings and assumption of HFOTCO indebtedness (offset by $1.1 billion of principal payments), partially offset by $129.9 million of dividends paid, $16.3 million of debt extinguishment costs and $11.1 million of payments related to debt issuances. Debt extinguishment costs related to the early payoff of our 2021 Notes. Debt issuance costs primarily related to the issuance of our 2025 and 2026 Notes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we had net cash inflows of $75.9 million, primarily as a result of $382.5 million of borrowings (offset by $396.9 million of principal payments) and $223.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of common shares (net of offering costs), partially offset by $92.9 million of dividends paid, $32.1 million of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests and $7.7 million of payments related to debt issuances. Debt issuance costs primarily relate to the increase in capacity under the SemGroup credit facility.\nLong-term Debt\nSemGroup Senior Unsecured Notes\nAt December 31, 2018, we had outstanding $400 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2022, $350 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2023, $325 million of 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2025 and $300 million of 7.250% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (collectively, the \"Notes\"). The Notes are governed by indentures, as supplemented, between the Company and its subsidiary guarantors and Wilmington Trust, N.A., as trustee (the Indentures\u201d). The Indentures include customary covenants and events of default.\nAt December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the terms of the Indentures.\nSemGroup Revolving Credit Facility\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $119.5 million of cash borrowings outstanding under our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility. In addition, we had $24.3 million in outstanding letters of credit on that date. The maximum letter of credit capacity under this facility is $250 million. The facility can be increased up to $300 million with the consent of the administrative agent. The credit agreement expires on March 15, 2021.\nThe credit agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on the creation of new indebtedness, liens, sale and lease-back transactions, new investments, making fundamental changes including mergers and consolidations, making of dividends and other distributions, making material changes in our business, modifying certain documents and maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio, a senior secured leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. In addition, the credit agreement prohibits any commodity transactions that are not permitted by our Risk Governance Policies.\nThe terms of our credit facility restrict, to some extent, the payment of cash dividends on our common stock. The credit agreement is guaranteed by all of our wholly-owned, material domestic subsidiaries and secured by a lien on substantially all of our property and assets, subject to customary exceptions.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had available borrowing capacity of $856.2 million under this facility.\nHFOTCO Credit Agreement\nOn June 26, 2018, HFOTCO and Buffalo Gulf Coast Terminals LLC (\"BGCT\") entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement (the Amendment and Restatement Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Amendment and Restatement Agreement, the HFOTCO credit agreement was amended and restated in its entirety (as so amended and restated, the Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement\u201d).\nThe Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement increased the aggregate term loans incurred thereunder to $600 million, terminated the HFOTCO $75.0 million revolving credit facility, and extended the maturity date of the term loans to June 26, 2025 (the Maturity Date\u201d). In addition, HFOTCO may incur additional term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of $120 million and a measure of HFOTCO's EBITDA, defined in the credit agreement, at the time of determination, plus additional amounts subject to satisfaction of certain leverage-based criteria, subject to receiving commitments for such additional term loans from either new lenders or increased commitments from existing lenders. The term loan B was issued at a discount of $1.5 million.\nAt HFOTCO's option, the term loans will bear interest at the Eurodollar rate or an alternate base rate ( ABR\u201d), plus, in each case, an applicable margin of 2.75% relating to any term loans accruing interest at the Eurodollar rate and 1.75% relating to term loans accruing interest at ABR.\nThe Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement includes customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, which were made only for the purposes of the Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement and as of the specific date (or dates) set forth therein, and may be subject to certain limitations as agreed upon by the contracting parties, and apply only to BGCT, HFOTCO and any subsidiaries of HFOTCO party to the Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement. Such limitations include the creation of new liens, indebtedness, making of certain restricted payments and payments on indebtedness, making certain dispositions, making material changes in business activities, making fundamental changes including liquidations, mergers or consolidations, making certain investments, entering into certain transactions with affiliates, making amendments to material agreements, modifying the fiscal year, dealing with hazardous materials in certain ways, entering into certain hedging arrangements, entering into certain restrictive agreements, and funding or engaging in sanctioned activities.\nThe Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including events of default relating to inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect when made or when deemed made, non-payment of principal and other amounts owing under the Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement, including, in respect of, violation of covenants, cross acceleration to any material indebtedness of BGCT, HFOTCO and its subsidiaries, bankruptcy and insolvency events, certain unsatisfied judgments, certain ERISA events, certain invalidities of loan documents and the occurrence of a change of control. A default under the Restated HFOTCO Credit Agreement would permit the participating banks to require immediate repayment of any outstanding loans with interest and any unpaid accrued fees, and subject to intercreditor arrangements with the holders of the HFOTCO tax exempt notes payable, exercise other rights and remedies.\nHFOTCO acquisition final payment\nOn April 17, 2018, we made the final payment related to the HFOTCO acquisition in the amount of $579.6 million. The payment was funded through revolving credit facility borrowings and cash on hand.\nSemCAMS Midstream\nOn February 25, 2019, SemCAMS Midstream entered into a credit agreement providing for a C$350.0 million senior secured term loan facility and a C$450.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility. For additional information, refer to Note 26 of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K.\nShelf Registration Statement\nWe have access to a universal shelf registration statement which provides us the ability to offer and sell an unlimited amount of debt and equity securities, subject to market conditions and our capital needs. This shelf registration statement expires in March 2019 and we intend to file a new universal shelf registration statement in March 2019.\nWe have also established an \"at the market\" offering program under the existing shelf registration statement, which provides for the offer and sale, from time to time, of common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $300 million. We are able to make sales in transactions at prices which are prevailing market prices at the time of sale, prices related to market prices or at negotiated prices. Such sales may be made pursuant to an Equity Distribution Agreement between us and certain agents who may act as sales agents or purchase for their own accounts as principals. To date, there have been no such sales.\nCapital Requirements\nThe midstream energy business can be capital intensive, requiring significant investment for the maintenance of existing assets or acquisition or development of new systems and facilities. We categorize our capital expenditures as either:\n \u2022 expansion capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long-term; or \n \u2022 maintenance capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures (including expenditures for the addition or improvement to, or the replacement of, our capital assets or for the acquisition of existing, or the construction or development of new, capital assets) made to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity.  During the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $390.7 million (cash basis), on capital projects. Projected capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, for 2019 are estimated at $262 million in expansion projects, including capital contributions to equity method investees to fund growth projects and $45 million in maintenance projects. These estimates may change as future events unfold. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nIn addition to our budgeted capital program, we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expansion capital expenditures in the future. Consequently, our ability to develop and maintain sources of funds to meet our capital requirements is critical to our ability to meet our growth objectives. We expect that our future expansion capital expenditures will be funded by cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities and the issuance of debt and equity securities.\nSemGroup Dividends\nThe table below sets out the dividends declared and/or paid by SemGroup for the periods indicated.\n\nOn January 19, 2018, we sold to certain institutional investors, in a private placement, an aggregate of 350,000 shares of our Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Preferred Stock\u201d), convertible into shares of our Class A common stock. Holders of the Preferred Stock will receive quarterly distributions equal to an annual rate of 7.0% ($70.00 per share annualized) of $1,000 per share of Preferred Stock, subject to certain adjustments. With respect to any quarter ending on or prior to June 30, 2020, we may elect, in lieu of paying a distribution in cash, to have the amount that would have been payable if such dividend had been paid in cash added to the Liquidation Preference.\nOn February 20, 2019, we declared a dividend, in the aggregate, of $6.4 million to the holders of Preferred Stock. We elected to have the $6.4 million, that would have been paid in cash as a dividend, added to the liquidation preference of such shares as a payment-in-kind. The payment-in-kind on the shares of Preferred Stock is March 1, 2019, and the record date is February 22, 2019.\nCredit Risk\nWe are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. We examine the creditworthiness of third-party customers to whom we extend credit and manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions, we may request letters of credit, prepayments or guarantees.\nCustomer Concentration\nShell Trading (US) Company, a customer of our U.S. Liquids segment, accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, at approximately 26%. The contracts from which our revenues are derived from this customer primarily relate to our crude marketing operations and are for crude oil purchases and sales at market prices. We are not substantially dependent on such contracts and believe that if we were to lose any or all of these contracts, they could be readily replaced under substantially similar terms. Although we have contracts with customers of varying durations, if one or more of our major customers were to default on their contract, or if we were unable to renew our contract with one or more of these customers on favorable terms, we might not be able to replace any of these customers in a timely fashion, on favorable terms or at all. In any of these situations, our revenues and our ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected. We expect our exposure to risk of non-payment or non-performance to continue as long as we remain substantially dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues.\nOur U.S. Gas segment has a significant concentration of producers which account for a large portion of our U.S. Gas segment's volumes. During the year ended December 31, 2018, three producers accounted for approximately 89% of our total processed volumes. During the year ended December 31, 2018, two producers accounted for 83% of our total gathered volumes. Additionally, all of the gathering and processing volumes from these customers are produced in the Northern Oklahoma region.\nOur Canada segment's processing plants require a minimum rate of sulfur tonnage to operate and to comply with the regulatory requirements for air emissions. We have several large producers that provide significant sour gas to our plants. If these producers shut in their sour gas production due to current or future commodity prices, it could result in regulatory non-compliance, as well as operating and financial impacts to our Canada segment. We expect to mitigate this risk for our KA plant through a sulfur turn-down project that was placed into service in 2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Item 303 of Regulation S-K.\nCommitments\nContractual Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of business we enter into various contractual obligations for varying terms and amounts. The following table includes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, and our best estimate of the period in which the obligation will be settled (in thousands):\n\n\n (1) Assumes interest rates, fee rates and letters of credit and loans outstanding as of December 31, 2018, and that same remain constant thereafter until maturity except for required principal payments. \n (2) Take-or-pay commitments include: (a) a five-year transportation take-or-pay agreement with White Cliffs for approximately 5,000 barrels per day which began in October 2015; (b) a seven-year transportation take-or-pay agreement for 5,000 barrels per day on a third-party pipeline which began in June 2017; and (c) a commitment related to fractionation of natural gas liquids through 2023. \n (3) The bulk of the commitments shown in the table above relate to agreements to purchase product from a counterparty and to sell a similar amount of product (in a different location) to the same counterparty. Many of the commitments shown in the table above are cancellable by either party, as long as notice is given within the time frame specified in the agreement (generally 30 to 120 days).  In addition to the items in the table above, we have entered into various operational commitments and agreements related to pipeline operations and to the marketing, transportation, terminalling and storage of petroleum products. We have also entered into certain derivative instruments. See Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K.\nLetters of Credit\nIn connection with our purchasing activities, we provide certain suppliers and transporters with irrevocable standby letters of credit to secure our obligation for the purchase of petroleum products. Our liabilities with respect to these purchase obligations are recorded as accounts payable on our balance sheet in the month the petroleum products are purchased. Generally, these letters of credit are issued for 70-day periods (with a maximum of 364-day periods) and are terminated upon completion of each transaction. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $43.4 million and $110.8 million, respectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects and legal and regulatory challenges. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed.\nOn an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable. Actual results may differ substantially from our estimates. Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K. We identify our critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\n\n\nIncome Taxes\nAt December 31, 2018, we had a cumulative U.S. federal net operating loss of approximately $535.6 million that can be carried forward to apply against taxable income generated in future years. $350.4 million of this carryforward has an indefinite carryforward period and the remaining carryforward begins to expire in 2031. We had cumulative U.S. state net operating losses of approximately $371.0 million available for carryforward, which begin to expire in 2019. We had foreign net operating losses of $0.8 million available for carryforward, which begin to expire in 2025. We had foreign tax credits of approximately $44.6 million available for carryforward, which begin to expire in 2020. We had interest expense limitation of $31.8 million available for indefinite carryforward.\nConsiderable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws. We are subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions including Canada.\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Assets and Other Intangible Assets for Impairment\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment\u201d and ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d, we evaluate property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators are:\n \u2022 significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset; \n \u2022 significant adverse change in the manner an asset is used or its physical condition; \n \u2022 adverse business climate; \n \u2022 accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset; \n \u2022 current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and \n \u2022 change in our intent about an asset from an intent to hold such asset through the end of its estimated useful life to a greater than fifty percent likelihood that such asset will be disposed of before then.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows. However, actual future market prices and costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates and the impact of such variations could be material.\nGoodwill\nWe apply ASC 805, Business Combinations,\u201d and ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,\u201d to account for goodwill. In accordance with these standards, goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. However, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We test for impairment at the reporting unit level using three valuation approaches: first, the income approach which measures the value of an asset by the present value of its future economic benefit; second, the market approach which measures the value of an asset through the analysis of recent sales or offerings of comparable properties; and third, the cost approach which measures the value of an asset by the cost to reconstruct or replace it with another of like utility.\nEstimation of future economic benefit requires management to make assumptions about numerous variables including selling prices, costs, the level of activity and appropriate discount rates. When goodwill balances are material, such as with our HFOTCO acquisition, relatively minor revisions to assumptions could result in a material future impairment. If it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, our goodwill will be impaired at that time.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe follow the guidance of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging,\u201d to account for derivative instruments. ASC 815 requires us to mark-to-market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet, and recognize changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments immediately in earnings. In certain cases, we may apply hedge accounting to our derivative instruments. The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are: (i) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure; (ii) whether the overall risk is being reduced; and (iii) if there is a correlation between the fair value of the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments accounted for as hedges are either recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the related hedged item, or deferred and recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur.\nCertain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered to be a normal purchase normal sale ( NPNS\u201d). The availability of this exception is based on the assumption that the company has the ability, and it is probable, to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item. These assumptions are based on internal forecasts of sales and historical physical delivery on contracts. Derivatives that are considered to be NPNS are exempt from derivative accounting treatment and are accounted for under accrual accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with immediate recognition through earnings.\nContingencies\nWe record a loss contingency when management determines that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. Gain contingencies are not recorded until realized.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K.\n ", "item_7_tables":

" Here is a summary of the key points from the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- SemGroup owns pipelines, storage facilities, trucks, and processing plants for gathering, transporting, storing, and processing petroleum products.\n\nRevenue Drivers\n- Revenue comes from fees charged for gathering, transporting, processing and storing petroleum products. It also comes from marketing petroleum products.\n\n- Financial results are positively correlated with the spread between current and future petroleum product prices.\n\n2018 Financial Results\n- Revenue was $2.5 billion, up from $2.1 billion in 2017. Net loss was $24 million compared to $17 million net loss in 2017.\n\n- Expansion projects and acquisition of HFOTCO drove increases in depreciation, interest expense, and other costs. Lower crude oil prices also impacted financial results.\n\nCapital Requirements\n- Midstream energy is a capital-intensive business. Significant investments are needed for maintaining existing assets and acquiring or developing new systems.\n\n- 2019 capital expenditure budget is $307 million, with $262 million for expansion projects and $45 million for maintenance.  \n\n- Future expansion projects will likely be funded through operating cash flows, debt issuances, and equity offerings.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n- Most critical accounting policies relate to income taxes, impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill, derivatives, and contingencies. These involve significant judgments and estimates that can materially impact financial statements."}
