MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our future results may vary materially from those indicated as a result of the risks that affect our business, including, among others, those identified in Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nOverview\nWe are a leading global provider of fleet and mobile asset management solutions delivered as SaaS. Our solutions deliver a measurable return by enabling our customers to manage, optimize and protect their investments in commercial fleets, mobile assets or personal vehicles. We generate actionable intelligence that enables a wide range of customers, from large enterprise fleets to small fleet operators and consumers, to reduce fuel and other operating costs, improve efficiency, enhance regulatory compliance, promote driver safety, manage risk and mitigate theft. Our solutions mostly rely on our proprietary, highly scalable technology platforms, which allows us to collect, analyze and deliver information based on data from our customers' vehicles. Using intuitive, web-based interface, reports or mobile applications, our fleet customers can access large volumes of real-time and historical data, monitor the location and status of their drivers and vehicles and analyze a wide number of key metrics across their fleet operations.\nIn fiscal year 2020, we collected data on an average of approximately 193 million trips per month representing as many as 10.1 billion vehicle locations per month. We have a global presence, with subscribers located in over 120 countries across six continents for whom we collectively tracked and managed over 818,000 subscribers at March 31, 2020.\nWe were founded in 1996 and we have offices in South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uganda, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, Romania, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates as well as a network of more than 130 fleet partners worldwide. MiX Telematics shares are publicly traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE: MIX) and MiX Telematics American Depositary Shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: MIXT).\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from subscriptions to our fleet and mobile asset management solutions. Our subscriptions generally include access to our SaaS solutions, connectivity, and in many cases, use of an in-vehicle device. We also generate revenues from the sale of in-vehicle devices, which enable customers to use our subscription-based solutions, installation services of our in-vehicle-devices and driver training for fleet customers. We generate sales through the efforts of our direct sales teams, staffed in our regional sales offices, and through our global network of distributors and dealers. Our direct sales teams focus on marketing our fleet solutions to global and multinational enterprise accounts and to other large customer accounts located in regions of the world where we maintain a direct sales presence. Our direct sales teams have industry expertise across multiple industries, including oil and gas, transportation and logistics, government and municipal, bus and coach, rental and leasing, and utilities. In some markets, we rely on a network of distributors and dealers to sell our solutions on our behalf. Our distributors and dealers also install our in-vehicle devices and provide training, technical support and ongoing maintenance for the customers they support.\nThrough March 31, 2020, we were subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act applicable to foreign private issuers ( FPIs\u201d). We therefore prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ( IFRS\u201d). As of April 1, 2020 we transitioned to domestic filer status and, therefore, our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2020 were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The financial information for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 in the discussion below has been presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nWe believe the large and growing market for fleet and mobile asset management solutions will provide us with significant growth opportunities going forward. We seek to capitalize on these growth opportunities and manage the factors affecting our performance, including the level of subscription and hardware revenues, fluctuations in the value of the South African Rand (our functional currency), an evolving mix of subscribers with different revenue and cost economics, varying economic conditions in our markets (e.g., the oil and gas sector), changing customer needs and long\nsales cycles for our enterprise fleet management solutions. See Factors Affecting Our Performance\u201d, for more information on these factors.\nWe intend to grow our revenue by adding new customers, selling more subscriptions to existing customers, and expanding our customer base to include industry sectors, customer segments and geographic regions beyond those that we currently serve. We will also continue to evolve our portfolio of products and services by introducing new innovative solutions.\nImpact of COVID-19\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported in China ( COVID-19\u201d). In January 2020, the World Health Organization ( WHO\u201d) declared this outbreak a Public Health Emergency of international concern and, subsequently, it was declared a pandemic in March 2020. The outbreak continued to spread globally, affecting global economic activity and financial markets. We are unable to accurately predict the impact that COVID-19 will have due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact on our customers and other factors identified in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors - The extent to which the coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) outbreak and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict.\" in this Form 10-K.\nBusiness, employees and operations\nDue to extensive measures implemented by various governments, all of our employees were required to work remotely, with the exception of our staff working in our monitoring centers, which were classified as an essential service. We have implemented appropriate safeguards for these centers. In addition, we have modified certain business and workforce practices (including extended work from home requirements, suspension of certain business travel and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) and implemented new protocols to promote social distancing and enhance sanitary measures in our offices and facilities to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by governmental and regulatory authorities.\nCOVID-19 has disrupted the operations of our customers and channel partners, our operations and the results of our operations. COVID-19 currently has had and, we believe, will continue to have an adverse impact on global economies and financial markets. For example the continued economic uncertainty in the oil and gas sector has resulted in significant declines in our customer's fleet sizes whilst similar disruption is evident in our bus and coach vertical following significantly reduced demand for public transport as a result of various governmental shut downs in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate in. This has and will continue to have a negative impact on our revenue and our results of operations, the size and duration of which we are currently unable to predict. During the last month of fiscal 2020 we experienced a small contraction in our subscriber base as a result of the impact of COVID 19, we expect this net contraction to continue into fiscal year 2021, and this together with certain pricing concessions, is likely to result in a decrease in reported subscription revenues.\nCash resources and liquidity\nBased on our internal projections we believe that we have sufficient cash reserves to support us for the foreseeable future. Further details on our cash resources and borrowings available under our credit facilities are provided in the liquidity and capital resources section below.\nFinancial position and impairments\nWe have taken into account the impact of COVID-19, to the extent possible, on our financial statements as at reporting date. However, future changes in economic conditions related to COVID-19 could have an impact on future estimates and judgements used, particularly those relating to Goodwill sensitivities and impairment assessments, as well as expected credit losses. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition.\nKey Financial Measures and Operating Metrics\nIn addition to financial measures based on our consolidated financial statements, we monitor our business operations using various financially and non-financially derived metrics.\nSubscription Revenue\nSubscription revenue represents subscription fees for our solutions, which include the use of our SaaS fleet management solutions, connectivity, and in many cases, our in-vehicle devices. Our subscription revenue is driven primarily by the number of subscribers and the monthly price per subscriber, which varies depending on the services and features customers require, hardware options, customer size and geographic location.\nSubscription revenue has increased as a percentage of total revenue. In fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020, subscription revenue represented 83.8%, 85.7% and 87.6% respectively, of our total revenue. In fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020, our top 10 customers represented 24.5%, 24.9% and 23.7% respectively, of our subscription revenue.\nSubscribers\nSubscribers represent the total number of discrete services we provide to customers at the end of the period.\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscribers </td> <td> </td> <td>676,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>750,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>818,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nLevel of Subscription Revenue and Hardware Revenue\nWe have historically been focused on growing our recurring subscription revenue base and entering into more fully bundled deals. As a result of an increase in the total subscriber base, and due to new and existing subscribers moving to fully-bundled subscriptions, subscription revenue has increased as a percentage of revenue. In fiscal year 2020, subscription-based revenues accounted for 87.6% of our total revenues, up from 85.7% in 2019 and 83.8% in 2018. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the level of business disruption as a result of the spread of COVID-19, the Company suspended its practice of issuing financial guidance and expects that subscription revenue could decline in fiscal 2021.\nAs market conditions improve globally, we believe that we will be well positioned to grow our base of subscribers, by adding both fully-bundled subscriptions; subscriptions where the hardware has been purchased upfront and various add-on solutions that can drive incremental average revenue per user ( ARPU\u201d) expansion over time. We intend to maintain our investment in sales and marketing and continue to attract new subscribers by introducing attractive new features and services.\nAdditionally, we believe we have the opportunity to expand our fleet management market share among our existing customer base by demonstrating our value proposition, growing with the customer, introducing new and innovative value-added solutions and displacing legacy fleet management solutions.\nFluctuations in Exchange Rates\nRevenue from our international operations has historically represented a substantial portion of our total revenue. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect our reported income and expenses as expressed in U.S. dollars (our reporting currency). The South African Rand is the functional currency for the Company. Currency fluctuations in the South African Rand may positively or negatively impact our reported income and expenses due to the effects of translating the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries into Rand at different average exchange rates and then translating into our reporting currency of U.S. Dollars.\nIn fiscal year 2020, the Rand weakened by 7.5% against the U.S. Dollar and by 4.2% against the British Pound, as shown in the table below.\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Average exchange rate for Fiscal Year Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South African Rand for U.S. Dollars (per $1.00) </td> <td>12.99 </td> <td> </td> <td>13.75 </td> <td> </td> <td>14.78 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% movement </td> <td>(7.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South African Rand for British Pound (per \u00a31.00) </td> <td>17.21 </td> <td> </td> <td>18.03 </td> <td> </td> <td>18.78 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% movement </td> <td>(6.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect continued exchange rate volatility in the South African Rand against other major currencies. The South African Rand has been even more volatile due to the uncertain economic conditions including the effect of COVID-19 and it is uncertain how long this will continue. As of July 21, 2020, the South African Rand/U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 16.51, 11.7% weaker than the average exchange rate for fiscal 2020. We expect a near-term impact on our financial results based on the more than 20% weakening of the South African Rand year-over-year.\nMix of Subscribers with Different Revenue and Cost Economics\nWe offer services to a wide range of customers, from large enterprise vehicle fleets to small fleet operators and consumers. The subscription revenue and cost per subscriber and the subscriber retention pattern differ by type of subscriber. For example, our entry-level consumer solution, Beam-e, is characterized by lower revenue and lower cost per subscriber compared to our large enterprise solutions. Small fleet and consumer customers will enter into and terminate contracts much more frequently than our enterprise customers, thereby affecting subscriber retention. As the mix of our subscriber base evolves, the average revenue per subscriber and average cost per subscriber is likely to change.\nVarying Economic Conditions in our Markets\nWe seek to capitalize on opportunities and manage risks in our key markets, which are geographically dispersed with subscribers located in more than 120 countries worldwide. Overall, we believe that our presence across multiple geographic markets and our exposure to multiple economies provides us with diversification from the risk of changing economic conditions in any one country or region. Other macroeconomic factors, such as expectations for future crude oil and natural gas prices, affect our customers' spending habits. Prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil and/or natural gas prices, or the perception that such prices will decrease in the future, negatively impacts our net subscriber growth and hardware sales in this sector. In addition to macroeconomic changes, performance in any given region may vary due to multiple factors, including growth in subscribers, the overall profile of the customer base (for example, in Africa, we have a significant consumer subscriber base), the services and hardware options selected by particular subscribers and our distribution strategy in the region.\nChanges in regional conditions require management to formulate strategic responses that safeguard our financial position and maintain our balanced approach to producing revenue growth, profitability and cash flow.\nChanging Customer Needs and Ongoing Investment in Technology\nWe continuously analyze market trends and opportunities in the various geographies in which we operate and have identified an opportunity to increase subscription revenue growth by the addition of new products and services in certain of the regions in which we operate. Our investment in software development is core to our business strategy. Our software teams employ an agile software development methodology. We have made a significant investment in product development, and we have routinely been among the first to market with innovative solutions and features that cater to the needs of our customers. For example, in fiscal 2019 we launched MiX Now our self-service, plug and play offering for small fleet operators. This easy to use system helps companies monitor and manage the behavior and performance of their vehicles and drivers.\nLong Sales Cycle for Our Enterprise Fleet Management Solutions\nFrom period to period, our revenues may fluctuate depending upon the customer contracts we have secured. The typical sales cycle for large enterprise fleet management solutions contracts may be long, especially by comparison to the sales cycle for our consumer solutions. It may also be difficult for us to predict the timing of when we will enter into enterprise fleet management contracts.\nLonger sales cycles for large contracts, for both customers who purchase in-vehicle devices and those who opt for the fully bundled option, may affect the comparability of financial results in certain segments. Our revenue may fluctuate from period to period depending on the level and timing of hardware sales, while subscription revenue growth is also impacted by the timing of the rollout of large enterprise fleets. We are focused on mitigating these long sales cycles and the associated volatility by enhancing our sales pipeline management process, by increasing our sales and marketing investment levels (due to investments in the Americas) and by diversifying our customer segment focus.\nInvestment in Sales and Marketing\nWe offer our solutions in over 120 countries through a combination of our direct and indirect marketing efforts. Our sales and marketing strategy is segmented by geographic region and customer type in order to cost effectively target and acquire new customers. In certain regions, we sell subscriptions of our fleet management solutions to large enterprise fleets through our direct sales force. In other regions, and for sales to small fleet operators and consumers, we work with an extensive distribution network of regional partners and national distribution dealers. Through our central services organization headquartered in South Africa, we provide common marketing, product management, technical and distribution support to each of our regional sales and marketing operations. We continue to focus on growth and expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our customer base and to expand within existing customers.\nBasis of Presentation and Key Components of Our Results of Operations\nIn fiscal year 2020, we managed our business in six segments which include Africa, Americas, Brazil, Europe and the Middle East and Australasia (our regional sales offices ( RSOs\u201d)), and our CSO. CSO is our central services organization that wholesales our products and services to our RSOs which, in turn, interface with our end-customers, distributors and dealers. CSO is also responsible for the development of our hardware and software platforms and provides common marketing, product management, technical and distribution support to each of our other operating segments.\nThe CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the reportable segments, has been identified collectively as the executive committee and the Chief Executive Officer who make strategic decisions. Segment performance is measured and evaluated by the CODM using Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure which uses net income, determined under International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS\u201d) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, as a starting point. Prior to the publication of the financial results for the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company published results under IFRS only, which is the reason for the CODM using a segment performance measure based on IFRS.\nIn determining Segment Adjusted EBITDA, the margin generated by CSO, net of any unrealized intercompany profit, is allocated to the geographic region where the external revenue is recorded by our RSOs. The costs remaining in CSO relate mainly to research and development of hardware and software platforms, common marketing, product management and technical and distribution support to each of the RSOs.\nEach RSO's results therefore reflects the external revenue earned, as well as the Segment Adjusted EBITDA earned (or loss incurred) before the remaining CSO and corporate costs allocations. Segment assets are not disclosed as this information is not reviewed by the CODM.\nRevenue\nThe majority of our revenue is subscription-based. Consequently, growth in subscribers influences our subscription revenue growth. However, other factors, including, but not limited to, the types of new subscribers we add and the timing of entry into subscription contracts also play a significant role. The price and terms of our customer subscription contracts vary based on a number of factors, including fleet size, hardware options, geographic region and distribution channel. In addition, we derive revenue from the sale of in-vehicle devices, which are used to collect, generate and transmit the data used to enable our SaaS solutions.\nOur customer contracts typically have a three to five year initial term. Following the initial term, most fleet customers elect to renew for fixed terms ranging from one to five years. Our third party dealers are typically billed monthly based on active connections. Some of our customer agreements, including our consumer subscriptions, provide for automatic monthly or yearly renewals unless the customer elects not to renew its subscription. Our consumer customer contracts in South Africa are governed by the Consumer Protection Act, which allows customers to cancel without paying\nthe full balance of the contract amount. Our fleet contracts and our customer contracts outside of South Africa are generally non-cancellable.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue associated with our subscription revenue consists primarily of costs related to cellular communications, infrastructure hosting, third-party data providers, service contract maintenance costs, commission expense related to third party dealers or distributors (commission is capitalized and amortized unless the amortization period is 12 months or less) and depreciation of our capitalized installed in-vehicle devices. Cost of sales associated with our hardware revenue includes the cost of the in-vehicle devices, cost of hardware warranty, shipping costs, custom duties, and commission expense related to third party dealers or distributors. We capitalize the cost of in-vehicle devices utilized to service customers, for customers selecting our bundled option, and we depreciate these costs from the date of installation over their expected useful lives.\nWe expect that cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue will vary from period to period depending on our revenue mix, including the proportion of our revenue attributable to our subscription-based services. The majority of the other components of our cost of revenue are variable and are affected by the number of subscribers, the composition of our subscriber base, and the number of new subscriptions sold in the period.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages to sales and marketing employees, commissions paid to employees, travel-related expenses, and advertising and promotional costs. We pay our sales employees commissions based on achieving subscription targets and we capitalize commission and amortize it (unless the amortization period is 12 months or less). Advertising costs consist primarily of costs for print, radio and television advertising, promotions, public relations, customer events, tradeshows and sponsorships. We expense advertising costs as incurred. We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing in order to grow our sales and build brand and category awareness.\nAdministration and Other Charges\nAdministration and other charges consist primarily of salaries and wages for administrative staff, travel costs, professional fees (including audit and legal fees), real estate leasing costs, expensed research and development costs and depreciation of fixed assets including vehicles and office equipment and amortization of intangible assets. We expect that administration and other charges will increase in absolute terms as we continue to grow our business.\nResearch and Development\nFor additional disclosures in respect of research and development, technology and intellectual property please refer to Item 1. Business\u201d\nTaxes\nIn fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020 our effective tax rates were 15.4%, 39.9% and 47.2% respectively, compared to a South African statutory rate of 28%. Taxation mainly consists of normal statutory income tax paid or payable and deferred tax on any temporary differences.\nOur effective tax rate may vary primarily according to the mix of profits made in various jurisdictions and the impact of certain non-deductible/(non-taxable) foreign exchange movements. A reconciliation of the actual tax rate to the South African tax rate of 28% is disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. As a result, significant variances in future periods may occur.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nWe use certain measures to assess the financial performance of its business. Certain of these measures are termed non-GAAP measures\u201d because they exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or are calculated using financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share.\nAn explanation of the relevance of each of the non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and a discussion of their limitations is set out below. We do not regard these non-GAAP measures as a substitute for, or superior to, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP or those calculated using financial measures that are calculated in accordance with U.S.GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are two of the profit measures reviewed by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM\u201d). We define Adjusted EBITDA as the income before income taxes, net interest income, net foreign exchange gains/(losses), depreciation of property and equipment including capitalized customer in-vehicle devices, amortization of intangible assets including capitalized internal-use software development costs and intangible assets identified as part of a business combination, stock-based compensation costs, restructuring costs and profits/(losses) on the disposal or impairments of assets or subsidiaries. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in this annual report because they are key measures that the Company's management and Board of Directors use to understand and evaluate its core operating performance and trends; to prepare and approve its annual budget; and to develop short and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of the Company's core business. Accordingly, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results.\nA reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the year, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with U.S GAAP is presented below.\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income for the year\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,987 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Income tax expense\n</td> <td>2,536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,829 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net interest income\n</td> <td>(385) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(233) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(67) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus/(less): Foreign exchange losses/(gains)\n</td> <td>390\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(28) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>610 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Depreciation (1)\n</td> <td>11,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,149 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Amortization (2)\n</td> <td>3,831 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,876 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,823 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Impairment of long-lived assets\n</td> <td>199\n</td> <td> </td> <td>62\n</td> <td> </td> <td>6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Stock-based compensation costs\n</td> <td>797\n</td> <td> </td> <td>511\n</td> <td> </td> <td>660\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net profit on sale of property and equipment\n</td> <td>(98) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(43) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(270) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Less)/Plus: Restructuring costs\n</td> <td>(57) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>221\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,726 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA margin\n</td> <td>24.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>28.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>28.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes depreciation of owned property and equipment (including in-vehicle devices).\n(2) Includes amortization of intangible assets (including intangible assets identified as part of a business combination).\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these performance measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.\nSome of these limitations are:\n\u2022although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to the Company;\n\u2022other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure; and\n\u2022certain of the adjustments (such as restructuring costs, impairment of long-lived assets and others) made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA are those that management believes are not representative of our underlying operations and, therefore, are subjective in nature.\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial performance measures, including income from operations, net income and our other results.\nBasic and Diluted non-GAAP Net Income per share\nNon-GAAP net income is defined as net income excluding net foreign exchange gains/(losses) net of tax.\nWe have included non-GAAP earnings per share in this annual report because it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business by excluding net foreign exchange gains/(losses) net of tax and associated tax consequences from earnings. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP earnings per share provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of non-GAAP net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended March 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income for the year\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,987 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net foreign exchange losses/(gains)\n</td> <td>390\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(28) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>610 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax effect of net foreign exchange losses/(gains)\n</td> <td>(2,263) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,028 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP net income\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,079 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,625 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic ('000)\n</td> <td>561,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>563,578 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>553,653 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted ('000)\n</td> <td>572,824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>583,741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>567,879 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConstant Currency Information\nConstant currency information has been presented in the sections below to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on the Company's results. The constant currency information has been determined by adjusting the current financial reporting year's results to the prior year's average exchange rates, determined as the average of the monthly exchange rates applicable to the year. The measurement has been performed for each of the Company's currencies, including the South African Rand and British Pound. The constant currency growth percentage has been calculated by utilizing the constant currency results compared to the prior year results.\nThe constant currency information represents non-GAAP information. We believe this provides a useful basis to measure the performance of our business as it removes distortion from the effects of foreign currency movements during the period.\nDue to the significant portion of our customers who are invoiced in non-U.S. Dollar denominated currencies, we also calculate our subscription revenue growth rate on a constant currency basis, thereby removing the effect of currency fluctuation on our results of operations.\nRefer to discussion below for the annual constant currency growth. The following tables provide the constant currency reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for the fiscal years shown:\nSubscription Revenue\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>

On a constant currency basis, the growth in subscription revenue was 18.0%. Subscribers increased by 10.8% since April 1, 2019 and additional growth is attributable to an increase in high ARPU bundled subscribers. Despite the increase in subscription revenue total revenue declined by $0.2 million, or 1.5%, due to $1.7 million lower hardware and other revenues compared to fiscal 2019. Total revenue increased by 1.7% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the Brazil segment subscription revenue increased by $0.5 million, or 11.3%. On a constant currency basis, the increase in subscription revenue was 20.9%. The increase was due to an increase in subscribers of 25.9% since April 1, 2019.

This resulted in a lower gross profit margin of 63.6% in fiscal year 2020 compared to 67.4% in fiscal year 2019.\nDuring fiscal 2020, subscription revenue gross profit margins were lower than in fiscal 2019, mainly due to accelerated depreciation of in-vehicle devices following contraction in certain fleets in the oil and gas vertical in the Americas segment.\nDuring fiscal 2020, hardware and other margins were lower than in fiscal 2019, mainly due to the geographical sales mix and the distribution channels. Hardware sales via our dealer channel attract lower gross margins. In addition there is pricing pressure on hardware pries as customers look to reduce the upfront cost of their investment.\nSales and Marketing\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except for percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td>$14,489 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing costs decreased by $1.2 million, or 8.0%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020 against a 1.4% increase in total revenue.

On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased by 39.6%.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except for percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue - subscription </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,940 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue - hardware and other </td> <td>11,554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,672 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin </td> <td>66.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>67.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin - subscription </td> <td>70.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>71.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin - hardware and other </td> <td>46.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>41.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCompared to an increase in total revenue of $11.9 million, or 9.0%, cost of revenues increased by $2.8 million, or 6.3%, from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019. This resulted in a higher gross profit margin of 67.4% in fiscal year 2019 compared to 66.5% in fiscal year 2018.\nSubscription revenue, which generates a higher gross profit margin than hardware and other revenue, contributed 85.7% of total revenue compared to 83.8% in fiscal year 2018.\nSales and Marketing\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except for percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td>$14,235 </td> <td> </td> <td>$14,489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing costs increased by $0.3 million, or 1.8%, from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019 against a 9.0% increase in total revenue. This was as a result of strict cost management as the Company achieved greater economies of scale. The increase in fiscal year 2019 was primarily as a result of a $0.2 million increase in advertising spend and other increases of $0.1 million, none of which were individually significant. In fiscal year 2019, sales and marketing costs represented 10.1% of revenue compared to 10.8% of revenue in fiscal year 2018.\nOn a constant currency basis sales and marketing costs increased by $1.1 million, or 7.7%. During fiscal year 2019, the increases in sales and marketing costs related primarily to our additional investments in the Americas segment, which were incurred to enhance our growth outside of the oil and gas vertical in such segment.\nAdministration and Other Expenses\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except for percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Administration and other </td> <td>$57,271 </td> <td> </td> <td>$58,040 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue </td> <td>43.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>40.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdministration and other expenses increased by $0.8 million, or 1.3%, from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019.The increase mainly relates to increases in IT costs of $0.5 million and professional fees of $0.4 million.\nTaxation\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except for percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxation </td> <td>$2,536 </td> <td> </td> <td>$9,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate </td> <td>15.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>39.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTaxation expense increased by $7.3 million, or 287%, while our effective tax rate increased by 24.5% to 39.9% in fiscal year 2019. A reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the South African corporate tax rate of 28% for both fiscal years 2019 and 2018, is presented in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. In fiscal year 2019 the effective tax rate increased by 14.0% as a result of certain non-deductible foreign exchange movements. In fiscal 2018 non-taxable foreign exchange differences decreased the tax rate by 13.2%. Further information is set out in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the last three fiscal years. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset these higher costs through price increases. Our inability to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nWe believe that our cash and borrowings available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.\nThe following tables provide a summary of our cash flows for each of the three years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020:\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash generated from operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,530) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,223) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,422) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,832) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,604) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,451) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exchange gains/(losses) on cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>2,171 </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,624) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,491) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>($1,173) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($9,186) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has minimum liquidity risk due to the recurring nature of its income and the availability of the cash resources set out below:\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, and cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of the year </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,652 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe fund our operations, capital expenditure and acquisitions through cash generated from operating activities, cash on hand and our undrawn borrowing facilities.\nAs of March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Company had approved, but not yet contracted, capital commitments for intangible assets of $4.8 million, $3.6 million and $3.0 million respectively.\nAs of March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Company had approved, and contracted, capital commitments for property and equipment of $1.0 million, $2.8 million and $1.8 million, respectively; and for intangible assets of $1.4 million, $1.3 million and $0.9 million respectively.\nCapital commitments will be funded out of a mixture of working capital and cash and cash equivalents.\nFollowing the completion of our IPO of ADSs in fiscal year 2014, we discontinued our then policy of declaring regular dividends in order to increase the funds available to pursue opportunities for more rapid growth. During fiscal year 2016, after a strategic review, the Board decided to reintroduce the Company's policy of paying regular dividends, which are considered on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\nOn May 23, 2017, the MiX Telematics Limited Board approved a share repurchase program of up to R270 million (equivalent of $15 million as of March 31, 2020) under which the Company may repurchase its ordinary shares, including ADSs. We expect any repurchases under this share repurchase program to be funded out of existing cash resources. Refer to Item 5. Market for Registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities\u201d for information regarding our share repurchase program.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash generated from operating activities during fiscal year 2018 consisted of our net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $36.9 million, a net investment in operating assets and liabilities of $6.3 million, net interest received of $0.4 million and taxes paid of $5.0 million.\nNet cash generated from operating activities increased from from $26.0 million in fiscal year 2018 to $31.5 million in fiscal year 2019, which is primarily attributable to improved net income (after excluding non-cash charges) before operating assets and liabilities changes of $10.7 million offset by negative net operating assets and liabilities changes of $4.4 million, higher net interest received of $0.3 million and increased taxation paid of $1.2 million. Net cash generated from operating activities during fiscal year 2019 consisted of our net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $47.6 million, a net investment in operating assets and liabilities of $10.6 million, net interest received of $0.7 million and taxes paid of $6.2 million.\nNet cash generated from operating activities decreased from $31.5 million in fiscal year 2019 to $28.2 million in fiscal year 2020 which is primarily attributable to more net income (after excluding non-cash charges) before operating assets and liabilities changes of $4.8 million offset by negative net operating assets and liabilities changes of $8.2 million, lower net interest received of $0.2 million and lower taxation paid of $0.4 million. Net cash generated from operating activities during fiscal year 2020 consisted of our net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $52.3 million, a net reduction in operating assets and liabilities investments of $18.8 million, net interest received of $0.5 million and taxes paid of $5.8 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2018 was $24.5 million. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2018 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $24.8 million. Capital expenditures during the year included purchases of intangible assets of $6.5 million, which included internal-use software of $4.0 million, customer relationships of $0.4 million, as well as computer software, technology and other intangibles of $2.1 million, and cash paid to purchase property, and equipment of $18.3 million, which included in-vehicle devices of $17.7 million. Offset by proceeds on sale of property and equipment and intangible assets of $0.3 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2019 decreased to $19.2 million from $24.5 million in fiscal year 2018. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2019 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $19.4 million. Capital expenditures during the year included purchases of intangible assets of $4.8 million, which included internal-use software of $3.5 million, as well as computer software, technology and other intangibles of $1.3 million, and cash paid to purchase property and equipment of $14.6 million, which included in-vehicle devices of $13.9 million. Offset by proceeds on sale of property and equipment and intangible assets of $0.2 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2020 increased to $19.4 million from $19.2 million in fiscal year 2019. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2020 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $20.4 million. Capital expenditures during the year included purchases of intangible assets of $5.7 million, which included internal-use software of $3.4 million as well as computer software, technology and other intangibles of $2.3 million, and cash paid to purchase property and equipment of $14.7 million, which included in-vehicle devices of $13.6 million. Net cash used in investing activities also included $0.3 million loan advanced to third parties offset by proceeds on sale of property and equipment and intangible assets of $1.3 million.\nFinancing Activities\nIn fiscal year 2018, the cash used in financing activities of $4.8 million consists of share repurchases of $1.4 million, dividends paid of $4.1 million and acquisition of non-controlling interest of $0.1 million, offset by proceeds from the issuance of shares in respect of employee stock options of $0.8 million.\nIn fiscal year 2019, the cash used in financing activities of $8.6 million includes share repurchases of $5.3 million, dividends paid of $4.9 million, offset by proceeds from issuance of shares in respect of employee stock options of $1.0 million and proceeds from the increase in short-term debt of $0.7 million.\nIn fiscal year 2020, the cash used in financing activities of $15.5 million includes share repurchases of $9.8 million, dividends paid of $6.0 million, offset by proceeds from short-term debt of $0.3 million.\nCredit Facilities\nAt March 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were net cash balances of $15.6 million (consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $18.0 million less short-term debt (bank overdraft)) of $2.4 million) and unutilized borrowing capacity of $3.6 million available through our credit facilities.\nOur principal sources of credit are our facilities with Standard Bank Limited and Nedbank Limited. We have an overdraft facility and an unutilized vehicle and asset finance facility of R8.5 million (equivalent of $0.5 million as of March 31, 2020) with Standard Bank Limited that bear interest at South African Prime less 1.2%. The Standard bank facility was amended during fiscal 2020, the overdraft was reduced from R70.0 million (equivalent of $3.9 million as of March 31, 2020) to R64.0 million (equivalent of $3.6 million as of March 31, 2020) and a working capital facility of R25.0 million (equivalent of $1.4 million as of March 31, 2020) was added. The working capital facility remains undrawn as of March 31, 2020.\nAt March 31, 2020, $2.4 million was utilized under the overdraft facility. We use this facility as part of our foreign currency hedging strategy. We draw down on this facility in the applicable foreign currency in order to fix the exchange rate on existing balance sheet foreign currency exposure that we anticipate settling in that foreign currency. Our obligations under the overdraft facility with Standard Bank Limited are guaranteed by the Company and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, MiX Telematics Africa Proprietary Limited and MiX Telematics International Proprietary Limited, and secured by a pledge of accounts receivable by the Company and MiX Telematics International Proprietary Limited.\nDuring fiscal year 2014, we entered into a R10.0 million (equivalent of $0.6 million as of March 31, 2020) facility from Nedbank Limited that bears interest at South African Prime less 2%. As of March 31, 2020, the facility was undrawn. We use this facility for working capital purposes in our Africa operations.\nOur credit facilities with Standard Bank Limited and Nedbank Limited contain certain restrictive clauses, including without limitation, those limiting our and our guarantor subsidiaries', as applicable, ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, or sell or acquire assets or businesses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain of our significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates are summarized below. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, the amortization period for deferred commissions, allowances for doubtful accounts, the assessment of expected cash flows used in evaluating goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, the determination of useful lives of the Company's customer relationships, contingencies, the classification of devices and other hardware as in-vehicle devices (equipment) versus inventory based on the future expectation of the different types of customer contracts, income and deferred taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. Our actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nEffective April 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d) using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Comparatives were not restated. The adoption resulted in the recognition of deferred commission assets of $3.8 million, an additional recurring commissions liability of $0.6 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $0.4 million, a contract asset of $0.1 million in respect of fixed escalations, and an increase in net deferred tax liabilities of $0.5 million, as of April 1, 2018. The net impact on retained earnings as of April 1, 2018 was $2.4 million. The impact of adoption on the Statement of Income for the year ended March 31, 2019 was not significant.\nSignificant Judgments\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of distinct promised products and/or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and/or services. We enter into contracts that include the supply of fleet and mobile asset management equipment. For such contracts, we utilize significant judgment to determine whether control of the equipment has transferred to the customer, and in instances where it does, we recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606. When control of the equipment does not transfer to the customer, which is when legal title does not transfer to the customer, our judgement is that the customer does not have the right to direct the use of the equipment when the customer does not operate the equipment or make any significant decisions about its use. In these instances the Company uses the equipment to provide fleet and mobile asset management services to the customer. Accordingly, these arrangements, which comprise virtually all of the transactions in which legal title does not pass to the customer, are not within the scope of ASC 842, Leases ( ASC 842\u201d). Instead, for such contracts we have concluded that they are service contracts comprising a single performance obligation, and revenue is recognized over time pursuant to ASC 606.\nRecognition and measurement\nWe provide fleet and mobile asset management solutions to our customers, and our principal revenue streams are (1) Subscription and (2) Hardware and other. Subscription revenue is recognized over time and hardware and other revenue is recognized at a point-in-time.\nTo provide services to customers, a device is required which collects and transmits information collected from the vehicle or other asset. Fleet customers may also obtain other items of hardware, virtually all of which are functionally-dependent on the device. Some customers obtain control of the device and other hardware (where legal title transfers to the customer); while other customers do not (where legal title remains with the Company). A contract arises on the acceptance of a customer's purchase order, which is typically executed in writing.\nWe distribute devices and other hardware to certain small fleet operators and consumers through distributors. Distributors act as agents and hardware revenue is only recognized when the distributor sells the hardware unit to the end customer. Once a unit is sold to a customer, the customer enters into a service agreement directly with the Company. The obligation to supply the service and the credit risk rests with us. The subscription revenue is recognized when the service is rendered.\nWe also sell hardware to motor vehicle dealerships for fitment into their vehicle trading stock. These dealerships purchase the hardware from us and are considered to act as a principal in the contract because they obtain title to the hardware, bear the risks and rewards of ownership and accordingly control the hardware purchased. The buyer of the vehicle then enters into a service-only contract with us. Revenue is recognized upon sale of the hardware to the dealership and subscription revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the customer.\nWe distribute devices and other hardware to enterprise fleet customers through dealers. Dealers are considered to act as a principal for the sale of hardware to the end customer, and revenue is recognized by us upon sale of the hardware unit to\nthe dealer. Dealers are also considered to act as a principal for the provision of the service to end customers because, even though the dealers do not provide the service themselves, the dealers control the right to receive the service before that right is transferred to the end customer, the dealers have the primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide the service to the end customer, and the dealers have full discretion in establishing the prices charged to the end customer. Accordingly, subscription revenue is recognized as the service is provided to the dealers.\nDeferred commissions\nCommissions incurred to acquire contracts are capitalized and amortized, unless the amortization period is 12 months or less. The commission capitalized is attributed to the specific performance obligations in the related contract. Commission is considered commensurate with respect to a particular contract when equivalent/comparable commission is payable upon the extension or renewal of such a contract or upon the customer entering into a new contract. To the extent commission capitalized is commensurate, the commission attributable to service will be amortized over the minimum contractual period or, if shorter, the expected life of the contract. To the extent it is not commensurate, the commission capitalized that is attributable to service is amortized over the expected life of the contract. Typically, with regard to month-to-month contracts, commission payable is not considered commensurate for such contracts because no commission is payable as and when the customer extends each month by not giving notice. Accordingly, commission incurred on such contracts that is attributable to service is amortized over the expected life of the contract taking account of expected extensions/renewals.\nRecurring commission is commission which is payable for each month the customer remains with us. The amount capitalized reflects the total commission payable over the minimum contractual period or, if shorter, the expected life of the contract, together with the effect of the time value of money, where significant.\nAmortization expense of external commissions capitalized is recognized in cost of sales, while that of internal commissions is recognized in sales and marketing costs. Commissions not capitalized under the 12-month practical expedient are also classified in the same manner.\nPrior to the adoption of ASC 606, commissions incurred to acquire contracts were recognized as expenses as incurred.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivables is calculated by considering all relevant information, internal and external about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to appropriately reflect the risk of losses over the remaining contractual life of an asset. Historical loss rates, calculated as actual losses over a period as a percentage of revenue, are adjusted for current conditions and management's expectations about future economic conditions.\nThe allowance is measured on a collective basis where management groups their customers appropriately based on their credit risk characteristics.\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is a valuation account and the asset's carrying amount is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Actual write-downs are recorded when the asset is deemed uncollectible after all efforts to recover have yielded no results.\nWe have adopted ASC 326 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses ( ASC 326\u201d) effective April 1, 2019. Prior to this date the allowance for doubtful accounts was determined on an incurred-loss basis.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for possible impairment at least annually, or when circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Goodwill is allocated to a reporting unit for the purpose of impairment testing. No impairments of goodwill existed as of the last testing date, March 31, 2020 or the previous testing, March 31, 2019. The changes in the carrying value of goodwill during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 are attributable only to foreign currency translation adjustments.\nAlthough there were no impairments of goodwill as of March 31, 2020, significant judgement was exercised in determining the fair value of each reporting unit, especially in light of COVID-19, which has had and, we believe, will continue to have an adverse impact on global economies and financial markets. In particular, to the extent that anticipated new contracts do not materialize and the business strategy does not come to fruition, or key personnel are not retained, the forecasts on which the impairment tests were performed could be negatively impacted.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nIntangible assets that are not ready for use are not subject to amortization but are assessed annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired.\nLong-lived assets that are subject to amortization or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nAn asset is written down immediately to its fair value if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its future undiscounted cash flows. Recognized impairment losses are not reversed.\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.\nIntangible Assets\nInternal-use software and technology\nJudgements and estimates occur in the calculation and capitalization of internal-use software and technology. We capitalize as intangible assets, internal-use software acquired or developed solely to meet our internal needs. Costs, excluding general and administrative costs, are capitalized from the date on which management implicitly or explicitly authorizes, or commits to fund, the project, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will perform the intended function (application development stage). All costs incurred during the preliminary development stage are expensed. Capitalization ceases when the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended use.\nCosts, including annual licenses, associated with maintaining computer software programs, and training costs are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred for upgrades and enhancements (modifications to existing internal-use software that provides additional functionality) are capitalized during the application development stage.\nSoftware capitalized is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life ranging from 1 to 18 years, commencing on the date when the software is ready for its intended use. Judgements and estimates are used in the determination of these useful lives.\nComputer Software for External Use\nJudgements and estimates occur in the calculation and capitalization of computer software for external use. Computer software for external use refers to the firmware that is developed for the devices and other hardware provided us to our customers. The costs of developing firmware are expensed as incurred prior to the establishment of its technological feasibility, from which point the development costs are capitalized and recognized as intangible assets. For the periods presented, technological feasibility could only be demonstrated shortly before the release of the firmware, and as a result, the development costs that meet the requirements for capitalization are not material.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\nThe cost of in-vehicle devices installed in vehicles (including installation and shipping costs) as well as the cost of uninstalled in-vehicle devices, is capitalized as property and equipment. We depreciate installed in-vehicle devices on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, commencing upon installation, whereas uninstalled in-vehicle devices are not depreciated until installed. The related depreciation expense is recorded as part of cost of revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nDepreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to reduce their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives.\nThe assets' useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.\nRight-of-use assets are included in property and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nTaxation\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. Where applicable tax legislation is subject to interpretation, management makes assessments, based on expert tax advice, of the relevant tax that is more likely than not to be paid and provides accordingly.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Income tax expense is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. The Company uses the portfolio approach for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income.\nThe current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws and tax rates enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Interest, and penalties, incurred on the underpayment of income taxes is classified as interest expense, and administration expenses, respectively.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax is measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Uncertainty generated by the current economic environment may affect the valuation of our deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax balances and associated valuation allowances represent management's best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimate.\nManagement periodically evaluates its tax positions with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. For uncertainties in income tax positions if it is more likely than not that some tax benefit will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position, then the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more likely than not that some tax benefit will be sustained, then zero tax benefit is recognized. As of March 31, 2018 and 2019, there was an uncertain tax position in respect of certain tax deductions, related to tax years prior to 2017, that were disallowed. No tax benefit was recognized because it was not considered more likely than not that the tax benefit would be realized. After a lengthy legal process, approval for the tax deductions was received in January 2020, resulting in the recognition of a current tax asset of $0.5 million. There were no material uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2020.\nDeferred tax liabilities arising on investments in domestic subsidiaries are not recognized to the extent that the investment can be recovered on a tax-free basis; and on investments in foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the undistributed earnings will be invested indefinitely or will be remitted in a tax-free liquidation.\nQuarterly results of operations\nThe table below sets out our quarterly results for each of the eight quarters in the period ending March 31, 2020.\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>

Subscription revenue growth is primarily due to increases in the number of total subscribers in each quarter.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe do not engage in any off-balance sheet financing activities. We do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities, which include special purpose entities and other structured finance entities which are not consolidated.\nTabular disclosure of contractual obligations\nAs a smaller reporting company\u201d, we are not required to provide this information.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our future results may vary materially from those indicated as a result of the risks that affect our business, including, among others, those identified in Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nOverview\nWe are a leading global provider of fleet and mobile asset management solutions delivered as SaaS. Our solutions deliver a measurable return by enabling our customers to manage, optimize and protect their investments in commercial fleets, mobile assets or personal vehicles. We generate actionable intelligence that enables a wide range of customers, from large enterprise fleets to small fleet operators and consumers, to reduce fuel and other operating costs, improve efficiency, enhance regulatory compliance, promote driver safety, manage risk and mitigate theft. Our solutions mostly rely on our proprietary, highly scalable technology platforms, which allows us to collect, analyze and deliver information based on data from our customers' vehicles. Using intuitive, web-based interface, reports or mobile applications, our fleet customers can access large volumes of real-time and historical data, monitor the location and status of their drivers and vehicles and analyze a wide number of key metrics across their fleet operations.\nIn fiscal year 2020, we collected data on an average of approximately 193 million trips per month representing as many as 10.1 billion vehicle locations per month. We have a global presence, with subscribers located in over 120 countries across six continents for whom we collectively tracked and managed over 818,000 subscribers at March 31, 2020.\nWe were founded in 1996 and we have offices in South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uganda, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, Romania, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates as well as a network of more than 130 fleet partners worldwide. MiX Telematics shares are publicly traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE: MIX) and MiX Telematics American Depositary Shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: MIXT).\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from subscriptions to our fleet and mobile asset management solutions. Our subscriptions generally include access to our SaaS solutions, connectivity, and in many cases, use of an in-vehicle device. We also generate revenues from the sale of in-vehicle devices, which enable customers to use our subscription-based solutions, installation services of our in-vehicle-devices and driver training for fleet customers. We generate sales through the efforts of our direct sales teams, staffed in our regional sales offices, and through our global network of distributors and dealers. Our direct sales teams focus on marketing our fleet solutions to global and multinational enterprise accounts and to other large customer accounts located in regions of the world where we maintain a direct sales presence. Our direct sales teams have industry expertise across multiple industries, including oil and gas, transportation and logistics, government and municipal, bus and coach, rental and leasing, and utilities. In some markets, we rely on a network of distributors and dealers to sell our solutions on our behalf. Our distributors and dealers also install our in-vehicle devices and provide training, technical support and ongoing maintenance for the customers they support.\nThrough March 31, 2020, we were subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act applicable to foreign private issuers ( FPIs\u201d). We therefore prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ( IFRS\u201d). As of April 1, 2020 we transitioned to domestic filer status and, therefore, our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2020 were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The financial information for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 in the discussion below has been presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nWe believe the large and growing market for fleet and mobile asset management solutions will provide us with significant growth opportunities going forward. We seek to capitalize on these growth opportunities and manage the factors affecting our performance, including the level of subscription and hardware revenues, fluctuations in the value of the South African Rand (our functional currency), an evolving mix of subscribers with different revenue and cost economics, varying economic conditions in our markets (e.g., the oil and gas sector), changing customer needs and long\nsales cycles for our enterprise fleet management solutions. See Factors Affecting Our Performance\u201d, for more information on these factors.\nWe intend to grow our revenue by adding new customers, selling more subscriptions to existing customers, and expanding our customer base to include industry sectors, customer segments and geographic regions beyond those that we currently serve. We will also continue to evolve our portfolio of products and services by introducing new innovative solutions.\nImpact of COVID-19\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported in China ( COVID-19\u201d). In January 2020, the World Health Organization ( WHO\u201d) declared this outbreak a Public Health Emergency of international concern and, subsequently, it was declared a pandemic in March 2020. The outbreak continued to spread globally, affecting global economic activity and financial markets. We are unable to accurately predict the impact that COVID-19 will have due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact on our customers and other factors identified in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors - The extent to which the coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) outbreak and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict.\" in this Form 10-K.\nBusiness, employees and operations\nDue to extensive measures implemented by various governments, all of our employees were required to work remotely, with the exception of our staff working in our monitoring centers, which were classified as an essential service. We have implemented appropriate safeguards for these centers. In addition, we have modified certain business and workforce practices (including extended work from home requirements, suspension of certain business travel and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) and implemented new protocols to promote social distancing and enhance sanitary measures in our offices and facilities to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by governmental and regulatory authorities.\nCOVID-19 has disrupted the operations of our customers and channel partners, our operations and the results of our operations. COVID-19 currently has had and, we believe, will continue to have an adverse impact on global economies and financial markets. For example the continued economic uncertainty in the oil and gas sector has resulted in significant declines in our customer's fleet sizes whilst similar disruption is evident in our bus and coach vertical following significantly reduced demand for public transport as a result of various governmental shut downs in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate in. This has and will continue to have a negative impact on our revenue and our results of operations, the size and duration of which we are currently unable to predict. During the last month of fiscal 2020 we experienced a small contraction in our subscriber base as a result of the impact of COVID 19, we expect this net contraction to continue into fiscal year 2021, and this together with certain pricing concessions, is likely to result in a decrease in reported subscription revenues.\nCash resources and liquidity\nBased on our internal projections we believe that we have sufficient cash reserves to support us for the foreseeable future. Further details on our cash resources and borrowings available under our credit facilities are provided in the liquidity and capital resources section below.\nFinancial position and impairments\nWe have taken into account the impact of COVID-19, to the extent possible, on our financial statements as at reporting date. However, future changes in economic conditions related to COVID-19 could have an impact on future estimates and judgements used, particularly those relating to Goodwill sensitivities and impairment assessments, as well as expected credit losses. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition.\nKey Financial Measures and Operating Metrics\nIn addition to financial measures based on our consolidated financial statements, we monitor our business operations using various financially and non-financially derived metrics.\nSubscription Revenue\nSubscription revenue represents subscription fees for our solutions, which include the use of our SaaS fleet management solutions, connectivity, and in many cases, our in-vehicle devices. Our subscription revenue is driven primarily by the number of subscribers and the monthly price per subscriber, which varies depending on the services and features customers require, hardware options, customer size and geographic location.\nSubscription revenue has increased as a percentage of total revenue. In fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020, subscription revenue represented 83.8%, 85.7% and 87.6% respectively, of our total revenue. In fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020, our top 10 customers represented 24.5%, 24.9% and 23.7% respectively, of our subscription revenue.\nSubscribers\nSubscribers represent the total number of discrete services we provide to customers at the end of the period.\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscribers </td> <td> </td> <td>676,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>750,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>818,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nLevel of Subscription Revenue and Hardware Revenue\nWe have historically been focused on growing our recurring subscription revenue base and entering into more fully bundled deals. As a result of an increase in the total subscriber base, and due to new and existing subscribers moving to fully-bundled subscriptions, subscription revenue has increased as a percentage of revenue. In fiscal year 2020, subscription-based revenues accounted for 87.6% of our total revenues, up from 85.7% in 2019 and 83.8% in 2018. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the level of business disruption as a result of the spread of COVID-19, the Company suspended its practice of issuing financial guidance and expects that subscription revenue could decline in fiscal 2021.\nAs market conditions improve globally, we believe that we will be well positioned to grow our base of subscribers, by adding both fully-bundled subscriptions; subscriptions where the hardware has been purchased upfront and various add-on solutions that can drive incremental average revenue per user ( ARPU\u201d) expansion over time. We intend to maintain our investment in sales and marketing and continue to attract new subscribers by introducing attractive new features and services.\nAdditionally, we believe we have the opportunity to expand our fleet management market share among our existing customer base by demonstrating our value proposition, growing with the customer, introducing new and innovative value-added solutions and displacing legacy fleet management solutions.\nFluctuations in Exchange Rates\nRevenue from our international operations has historically represented a substantial portion of our total revenue. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect our reported income and expenses as expressed in U.S. dollars (our reporting currency). The South African Rand is the functional currency for the Company. Currency fluctuations in the South African Rand may positively or negatively impact our reported income and expenses due to the effects of translating the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries into Rand at different average exchange rates and then translating into our reporting currency of U.S. Dollars.\nIn fiscal year 2020, the Rand weakened by 7.5% against the U.S. Dollar and by 4.2% against the British Pound, as shown in the table below.\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Average exchange rate for Fiscal Year Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South African Rand for U.S. Dollars (per $1.00) </td> <td>12.99 </td> <td> </td> <td>13.75 </td> <td> </td> <td>14.78 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% movement </td> <td>(7.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South African Rand for British Pound (per \u00a31.00) </td> <td>17.21 </td> <td> </td> <td>18.03 </td> <td> </td> <td>18.78 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% movement </td> <td>(6.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect continued exchange rate volatility in the South African Rand against other major currencies. The South African Rand has been even more volatile due to the uncertain economic conditions including the effect of COVID-19 and it is uncertain how long this will continue. As of July 21, 2020, the South African Rand/U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 16.51, 11.7% weaker than the average exchange rate for fiscal 2020. We expect a near-term impact on our financial results based on the more than 20% weakening of the South African Rand year-over-year.\nMix of Subscribers with Different Revenue and Cost Economics\nWe offer services to a wide range of customers, from large enterprise vehicle fleets to small fleet operators and consumers. The subscription revenue and cost per subscriber and the subscriber retention pattern differ by type of subscriber. For example, our entry-level consumer solution, Beam-e, is characterized by lower revenue and lower cost per subscriber compared to our large enterprise solutions. Small fleet and consumer customers will enter into and terminate contracts much more frequently than our enterprise customers, thereby affecting subscriber retention. As the mix of our subscriber base evolves, the average revenue per subscriber and average cost per subscriber is likely to change.\nVarying Economic Conditions in our Markets\nWe seek to capitalize on opportunities and manage risks in our key markets, which are geographically dispersed with subscribers located in more than 120 countries worldwide. Overall, we believe that our presence across multiple geographic markets and our exposure to multiple economies provides us with diversification from the risk of changing economic conditions in any one country or region. Other macroeconomic factors, such as expectations for future crude oil and natural gas prices, affect our customers' spending habits. Prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil and/or natural gas prices, or the perception that such prices will decrease in the future, negatively impacts our net subscriber growth and hardware sales in this sector. In addition to macroeconomic changes, performance in any given region may vary due to multiple factors, including growth in subscribers, the overall profile of the customer base (for example, in Africa, we have a significant consumer subscriber base), the services and hardware options selected by particular subscribers and our distribution strategy in the region.\nChanges in regional conditions require management to formulate strategic responses that safeguard our financial position and maintain our balanced approach to producing revenue growth, profitability and cash flow.\nChanging Customer Needs and Ongoing Investment in Technology\nWe continuously analyze market trends and opportunities in the various geographies in which we operate and have identified an opportunity to increase subscription revenue growth by the addition of new products and services in certain of the regions in which we operate. Our investment in software development is core to our business strategy. Our software teams employ an agile software development methodology. We have made a significant investment in product development, and we have routinely been among the first to market with innovative solutions and features that cater to the needs of our customers. For example, in fiscal 2019 we launched MiX Now our self-service, plug and play offering for small fleet operators. This easy to use system helps companies monitor and manage the behavior and performance of their vehicles and drivers.\nLong Sales Cycle for Our Enterprise Fleet Management Solutions\nFrom period to period, our revenues may fluctuate depending upon the customer contracts we have secured. The typical sales cycle for large enterprise fleet management solutions contracts may be long, especially by comparison to the sales cycle for our consumer solutions. It may also be difficult for us to predict the timing of when we will enter into enterprise fleet management contracts.\nLonger sales cycles for large contracts, for both customers who purchase in-vehicle devices and those who opt for the fully bundled option, may affect the comparability of financial results in certain segments. Our revenue may fluctuate from period to period depending on the level and timing of hardware sales, while subscription revenue growth is also impacted by the timing of the rollout of large enterprise fleets. We are focused on mitigating these long sales cycles and the associated volatility by enhancing our sales pipeline management process, by increasing our sales and marketing investment levels (due to investments in the Americas) and by diversifying our customer segment focus.\nInvestment in Sales and Marketing\nWe offer our solutions in over 120 countries through a combination of our direct and indirect marketing efforts. Our sales and marketing strategy is segmented by geographic region and customer type in order to cost effectively target and acquire new customers. In certain regions, we sell subscriptions of our fleet management solutions to large enterprise fleets through our direct sales force. In other regions, and for sales to small fleet operators and consumers, we work with an extensive distribution network of regional partners and national distribution dealers. Through our central services organization headquartered in South Africa, we provide common marketing, product management, technical and distribution support to each of our regional sales and marketing operations. We continue to focus on growth and expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our customer base and to expand within existing customers.\nBasis of Presentation and Key Components of Our Results of Operations\nIn fiscal year 2020, we managed our business in six segments which include Africa, Americas, Brazil, Europe and the Middle East and Australasia (our regional sales offices ( RSOs\u201d)), and our CSO. CSO is our central services organization that wholesales our products and services to our RSOs which, in turn, interface with our end-customers, distributors and dealers. CSO is also responsible for the development of our hardware and software platforms and provides common marketing, product management, technical and distribution support to each of our other operating segments.\nThe CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the reportable segments, has been identified collectively as the executive committee and the Chief Executive Officer who make strategic decisions. Segment performance is measured and evaluated by the CODM using Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure which uses net income, determined under International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS\u201d) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, as a starting point. Prior to the publication of the financial results for the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company published results under IFRS only, which is the reason for the CODM using a segment performance measure based on IFRS.\nIn determining Segment Adjusted EBITDA, the margin generated by CSO, net of any unrealized intercompany profit, is allocated to the geographic region where the external revenue is recorded by our RSOs. The costs remaining in CSO relate mainly to research and development of hardware and software platforms, common marketing, product management and technical and distribution support to each of the RSOs.\nEach RSO's results therefore reflects the external revenue earned, as well as the Segment Adjusted EBITDA earned (or loss incurred) before the remaining CSO and corporate costs allocations. Segment assets are not disclosed as this information is not reviewed by the CODM.\nRevenue\nThe majority of our revenue is subscription-based. Consequently, growth in subscribers influences our subscription revenue growth. However, other factors, including, but not limited to, the types of new subscribers we add and the timing of entry into subscription contracts also play a significant role. The price and terms of our customer subscription contracts vary based on a number of factors, including fleet size, hardware options, geographic region and distribution channel. In addition, we derive revenue from the sale of in-vehicle devices, which are used to collect, generate and transmit the data used to enable our SaaS solutions.\nOur customer contracts typically have a three to five year initial term. Following the initial term, most fleet customers elect to renew for fixed terms ranging from one to five years. Our third party dealers are typically billed monthly based on active connections. Some of our customer agreements, including our consumer subscriptions, provide for automatic monthly or yearly renewals unless the customer elects not to renew its subscription. Our consumer customer contracts in South Africa are governed by the Consumer Protection Act, which allows customers to cancel without paying\nthe full balance of the contract amount. Our fleet contracts and our customer contracts outside of South Africa are generally non-cancellable.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue associated with our subscription revenue consists primarily of costs related to cellular communications, infrastructure hosting, third-party data providers, service contract maintenance costs, commission expense related to third party dealers or distributors (commission is capitalized and amortized unless the amortization period is 12 months or less) and depreciation of our capitalized installed in-vehicle devices. Cost of sales associated with our hardware revenue includes the cost of the in-vehicle devices, cost of hardware warranty, shipping costs, custom duties, and commission expense related to third party dealers or distributors. We capitalize the cost of in-vehicle devices utilized to service customers, for customers selecting our bundled option, and we depreciate these costs from the date of installation over their expected useful lives.\nWe expect that cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue will vary from period to period depending on our revenue mix, including the proportion of our revenue attributable to our subscription-based services. The majority of the other components of our cost of revenue are variable and are affected by the number of subscribers, the composition of our subscriber base, and the number of new subscriptions sold in the period.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages to sales and marketing employees, commissions paid to employees, travel-related expenses, and advertising and promotional costs. We pay our sales employees commissions based on achieving subscription targets and we capitalize commission and amortize it (unless the amortization period is 12 months or less). Advertising costs consist primarily of costs for print, radio and television advertising, promotions, public relations, customer events, tradeshows and sponsorships. We expense advertising costs as incurred. We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing in order to grow our sales and build brand and category awareness.\nAdministration and Other Charges\nAdministration and other charges consist primarily of salaries and wages for administrative staff, travel costs, professional fees (including audit and legal fees), real estate leasing costs, expensed research and development costs and depreciation of fixed assets including vehicles and office equipment and amortization of intangible assets. We expect that administration and other charges will increase in absolute terms as we continue to grow our business.\nResearch and Development\nFor additional disclosures in respect of research and development, technology and intellectual property please refer to Item 1. Business\u201d\nTaxes\nIn fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020 our effective tax rates were 15.4%, 39.9% and 47.2% respectively, compared to a South African statutory rate of 28%. Taxation mainly consists of normal statutory income tax paid or payable and deferred tax on any temporary differences.\nOur effective tax rate may vary primarily according to the mix of profits made in various jurisdictions and the impact of certain non-deductible/(non-taxable) foreign exchange movements. A reconciliation of the actual tax rate to the South African tax rate of 28% is disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. As a result, significant variances in future periods may occur.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nWe use certain measures to assess the financial performance of its business. Certain of these measures are termed non-GAAP measures\u201d because they exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or are calculated using financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share.\nAn explanation of the relevance of each of the non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and a discussion of their limitations is set out below. We do not regard these non-GAAP measures as a substitute for, or superior to, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP or those calculated using financial measures that are calculated in accordance with U.S.GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are two of the profit measures reviewed by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM\u201d). We define Adjusted EBITDA as the income before income taxes, net interest income, net foreign exchange gains/(losses), depreciation of property and equipment including capitalized customer in-vehicle devices, amortization of intangible assets including capitalized internal-use software development costs and intangible assets identified as part of a business combination, stock-based compensation costs, restructuring costs and profits/(losses) on the disposal or impairments of assets or subsidiaries. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in this annual report because they are key measures that the Company's management and Board of Directors use to understand and evaluate its core operating performance and trends; to prepare and approve its annual budget; and to develop short and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of the Company's core business. Accordingly, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results.\nA reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the year, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with U.S GAAP is presented below.\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income for the year\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,987 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Income tax expense\n</td> <td>2,536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,829 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net interest income\n</td> <td>(385) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(233) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(67) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus/(less): Foreign exchange losses/(gains)\n</td> <td>390\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(28) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>610 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Depreciation (1)\n</td> <td>11,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,149 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Amortization (2)\n</td> <td>3,831 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,876 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,823 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Impairment of long-lived assets\n</td> <td>199\n</td> <td> </td> <td>62\n</td> <td> </td> <td>6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Stock-based compensation costs\n</td> <td>797\n</td> <td> </td> <td>511\n</td> <td> </td> <td>660\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net profit on sale of property and equipment\n</td> <td>(98) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(43) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(270) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Less)/Plus: Restructuring costs\n</td> <td>(57) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>221\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,726 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA margin\n</td> <td>24.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>28.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>28.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes depreciation of owned property and equipment (including in-vehicle devices).\n(2) Includes amortization of intangible assets (including intangible assets identified as part of a business combination).\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these performance measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.\nSome of these limitations are:\n\u2022although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to the Company;\n\u2022other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure; and\n\u2022certain of the adjustments (such as restructuring costs, impairment of long-lived assets and others) made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA are those that management believes are not representative of our underlying operations and, therefore, are subjective in nature.\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial performance measures, including income from operations, net income and our other results.\nBasic and Diluted non-GAAP Net Income per share\nNon-GAAP net income is defined as net income excluding net foreign exchange gains/(losses) net of tax.\nWe have included non-GAAP earnings per share in this annual report because it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business by excluding net foreign exchange gains/(losses) net of tax and associated tax consequences from earnings. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP earnings per share provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of non-GAAP net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended March 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income for the year\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,987 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net foreign exchange losses/(gains)\n</td> <td>390\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(28) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>610 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax effect of net foreign exchange losses/(gains)\n</td> <td>(2,263) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,028 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP net income\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,079 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,625 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic ('000)\n</td> <td>561,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>563,578 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>553,653 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted ('000)\n</td> <td>572,824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>583,741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>567,879 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConstant Currency Information\nConstant currency information has been presented in the sections below to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on the Company's results. The constant currency information has been determined by adjusting the current financial reporting year's results to the prior year's average exchange rates, determined as the average of the monthly exchange rates applicable to the year. The measurement has been performed for each of the Company's currencies, including the South African Rand and British Pound. The constant currency growth percentage has been calculated by utilizing the constant currency results compared to the prior year results.\nThe constant currency information represents non-GAAP information. We believe this provides a useful basis to measure the performance of our business as it removes distortion from the effects of foreign currency movements during the period.\nDue to the significant portion of our customers who are invoiced in non-U.S. Dollar denominated currencies, we also calculate our subscription revenue growth rate on a constant currency basis, thereby removing the effect of currency fluctuation on our results of operations.\nRefer to discussion below for the annual constant currency growth. The following tables provide the constant currency reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for the fiscal years shown:\nSubscription Revenue\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>

The principal factors affecting our revenue growth included:\n\u2022Subscription revenue grew by $4.4 million, or 3.6% from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. Subscription revenue represented 87.6% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020 compared to 85.7% for the prior year. Our growth in subscription revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in subscribers, which increased by 9.1% from 750,455 at March 31, 2019, to 818,487 at March 31, 2020. There was no material movement in ARPUs from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020.

On a constant currency basis, the growth in subscription revenue was 18.0%. Subscribers increased by 10.8% since April 1, 2019 and additional growth is attributable to an increase in high ARPU bundled subscribers. Despite the increase in subscription revenue total revenue declined by $0.2 million, or 1.5%, due to $1.7 million lower hardware and other revenues compared to fiscal 2019. Total revenue increased by 1.7% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the Brazil segment subscription revenue increased by $0.5 million, or 11.3%. On a constant currency basis, the increase in subscription revenue was 20.9%. The increase was due to an increase in subscribers of 25.9% since April 1, 2019.

This resulted in a lower gross profit margin of 63.6% in fiscal year 2020 compared to 67.4% in fiscal year 2019.\nDuring fiscal 2020, subscription revenue gross profit margins were lower than in fiscal 2019, mainly due to accelerated depreciation of in-vehicle devices following contraction in certain fleets in the oil and gas vertical in the Americas segment.\nDuring fiscal 2020, hardware and other margins were lower than in fiscal 2019, mainly due to the geographical sales mix and the distribution channels. Hardware sales via our dealer channel attract lower gross margins.

Our inability to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nWe believe that our cash and borrowings available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.\nThe following tables provide a summary of our cash flows for each of the three years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020:\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash generated from operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,530) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,223) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,422) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,832) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,604) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,451) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exchange gains/(losses) on cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>2,171 </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,624) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,491) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>($1,173) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($9,186) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has minimum liquidity risk due to the recurring nature of its income and the availability of the cash resources set out below:\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, and cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of the year </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,652 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe fund our operations, capital expenditure and acquisitions through cash generated from operating activities, cash on hand and our undrawn borrowing facilities.\nAs of March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Company had approved, but not yet contracted, capital commitments for intangible assets of $4.8 million, $3.6 million and $3.0 million respectively.\nAs of March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Company had approved, and contracted, capital commitments for property and equipment of $1.0 million, $2.8 million and $1.8 million, respectively; and for intangible assets of $1.4 million, $1.3 million and $0.9 million respectively.\nCapital commitments will be funded out of a mixture of working capital and cash and cash equivalents.\nFollowing the completion of our IPO of ADSs in fiscal year 2014, we discontinued our then policy of declaring regular dividends in order to increase the funds available to pursue opportunities for more rapid growth. During fiscal year 2016, after a strategic review, the Board decided to reintroduce the Company's policy of paying regular dividends, which are considered on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\nOn May 23, 2017, the MiX Telematics Limited Board approved a share repurchase program of up to R270 million (equivalent of $15 million as of March 31, 2020) under which the Company may repurchase its ordinary shares, including ADSs. We expect any repurchases under this share repurchase program to be funded out of existing cash resources. Refer to Item 5. Market for Registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities\u201d for information regarding our share repurchase program.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash generated from operating activities during fiscal year 2018 consisted of our net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $36.9 million, a net investment in operating assets and liabilities of $6.3 million, net interest received of $0.4 million and taxes paid of $5.0 million.\nNet cash generated from operating activities increased from from $26.0 million in fiscal year 2018 to $31.5 million in fiscal year 2019, which is primarily attributable to improved net income (after excluding non-cash charges) before operating assets and liabilities changes of $10.7 million offset by negative net operating assets and liabilities changes of $4.4 million, higher net interest received of $0.3 million and increased taxation paid of $1.2 million. Net cash generated from operating activities during fiscal year 2019 consisted of our net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $47.6 million, a net investment in operating assets and liabilities of $10.6 million, net interest received of $0.7 million and taxes paid of $6.2 million.\nNet cash generated from operating activities decreased from $31.5 million in fiscal year 2019 to $28.2 million in fiscal year 2020 which is primarily attributable to more net income (after excluding non-cash charges) before operating assets and liabilities changes of $4.8 million offset by negative net operating assets and liabilities changes of $8.2 million, lower net interest received of $0.2 million and lower taxation paid of $0.4 million. Net cash generated from operating activities during fiscal year 2020 consisted of our net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $52.3 million, a net reduction in operating assets and liabilities investments of $18.8 million, net interest received of $0.5 million and taxes paid of $5.8 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2018 was $24.5 million. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2018 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $24.8 million. Capital expenditures during the year included purchases of intangible assets of $6.5 million, which included internal-use software of $4.0 million, customer relationships of $0.4 million, as well as computer software, technology and other intangibles of $2.1 million, and cash paid to purchase property, and equipment of $18.3 million, which included in-vehicle devices of $17.7 million. Offset by proceeds on sale of property and equipment and intangible assets of $0.3 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2019 decreased to $19.2 million from $24.5 million in fiscal year 2018. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2019 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $19.4 million. Capital expenditures during the year included purchases of intangible assets of $4.8 million, which included internal-use software of $3.5 million, as well as computer software, technology and other intangibles of $1.3 million, and cash paid to purchase property and equipment of $14.6 million, which included in-vehicle devices of $13.9 million. Offset by proceeds on sale of property and equipment and intangible assets of $0.2 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2020 increased to $19.4 million from $19.2 million in fiscal year 2019. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2020 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $20.4 million. Capital expenditures during the year included purchases of intangible assets of $5.7 million, which included internal-use software of $3.4 million as well as computer software, technology and other intangibles of $2.3 million, and cash paid to purchase property and equipment of $14.7 million, which included in-vehicle devices of $13.6 million. Net cash used in investing activities also included $0.3 million loan advanced to third parties offset by proceeds on sale of property and equipment and intangible assets of $1.3 million.\nFinancing Activities\nIn fiscal year 2018, the cash used in financing activities of $4.8 million consists of share repurchases of $1.4 million, dividends paid of $4.1 million and acquisition of non-controlling interest of $0.1 million, offset by proceeds from the issuance of shares in respect of employee stock options of $0.8 million.\nIn fiscal year 2019, the cash used in financing activities of $8.6 million includes share repurchases of $5.3 million, dividends paid of $4.9 million, offset by proceeds from issuance of shares in respect of employee stock options of $1.0 million and proceeds from the increase in short-term debt of $0.7 million.\nIn fiscal year 2020, the cash used in financing activities of $15.5 million includes share repurchases of $9.8 million, dividends paid of $6.0 million, offset by proceeds from short-term debt of $0.3 million.\nCredit Facilities\nAt March 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were net cash balances of $15.6 million (consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $18.0 million less short-term debt (bank overdraft)) of $2.4 million) and unutilized borrowing capacity of $3.6 million available through our credit facilities.\nOur principal sources of credit are our facilities with Standard Bank Limited and Nedbank Limited. We have an overdraft facility and an unutilized vehicle and asset finance facility of R8.5 million (equivalent of $0.5 million as of March 31, 2020) with Standard Bank Limited that bear interest at South African Prime less 1.2%. The Standard bank facility was amended during fiscal 2020, the overdraft was reduced from R70.0 million (equivalent of $3.9 million as of March 31, 2020) to R64.0 million (equivalent of $3.6 million as of March 31, 2020) and a working capital facility of R25.0 million (equivalent of $1.4 million as of March 31, 2020) was added. The working capital facility remains undrawn as of March 31, 2020.\nAt March 31, 2020, $2.4 million was utilized under the overdraft facility. We use this facility as part of our foreign currency hedging strategy. We draw down on this facility in the applicable foreign currency in order to fix the exchange rate on existing balance sheet foreign currency exposure that we anticipate settling in that foreign currency. Our obligations under the overdraft facility with Standard Bank Limited are guaranteed by the Company and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, MiX Telematics Africa Proprietary Limited and MiX Telematics International Proprietary Limited, and secured by a pledge of accounts receivable by the Company and MiX Telematics International Proprietary Limited.\nDuring fiscal year 2014, we entered into a R10.0 million (equivalent of $0.6 million as of March 31, 2020) facility from Nedbank Limited that bears interest at South African Prime less 2%. As of March 31, 2020, the facility was undrawn. We use this facility for working capital purposes in our Africa operations.\nOur credit facilities with Standard Bank Limited and Nedbank Limited contain certain restrictive clauses, including without limitation, those limiting our and our guarantor subsidiaries', as applicable, ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, or sell or acquire assets or businesses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain of our significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates are summarized below. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, the amortization period for deferred commissions, allowances for doubtful accounts, the assessment of expected cash flows used in evaluating goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, the determination of useful lives of the Company's customer relationships, contingencies, the classification of devices and other hardware as in-vehicle devices (equipment) versus inventory based on the future expectation of the different types of customer contracts, income and deferred taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. Our actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nEffective April 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d) using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Comparatives were not restated. The adoption resulted in the recognition of deferred commission assets of $3.8 million, an additional recurring commissions liability of $0.6 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $0.4 million, a contract asset of $0.1 million in respect of fixed escalations, and an increase in net deferred tax liabilities of $0.5 million, as of April 1, 2018. The net impact on retained earnings as of April 1, 2018 was $2.4 million. The impact of adoption on the Statement of Income for the year ended March 31, 2019 was not significant.\nSignificant Judgments\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of distinct promised products and/or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and/or services. We enter into contracts that include the supply of fleet and mobile asset management equipment. For such contracts, we utilize significant judgment to determine whether control of the equipment has transferred to the customer, and in instances where it does, we recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606. When control of the equipment does not transfer to the customer, which is when legal title does not transfer to the customer, our judgement is that the customer does not have the right to direct the use of the equipment when the customer does not operate the equipment or make any significant decisions about its use. In these instances the Company uses the equipment to provide fleet and mobile asset management services to the customer. Accordingly, these arrangements, which comprise virtually all of the transactions in which legal title does not pass to the customer, are not within the scope of ASC 842, Leases ( ASC 842\u201d). Instead, for such contracts we have concluded that they are service contracts comprising a single performance obligation, and revenue is recognized over time pursuant to ASC 606.\nRecognition and measurement\nWe provide fleet and mobile asset management solutions to our customers, and our principal revenue streams are (1) Subscription and (2) Hardware and other. Subscription revenue is recognized over time and hardware and other revenue is recognized at a point-in-time.\nTo provide services to customers, a device is required which collects and transmits information collected from the vehicle or other asset. Fleet customers may also obtain other items of hardware, virtually all of which are functionally-dependent on the device. Some customers obtain control of the device and other hardware (where legal title transfers to the customer); while other customers do not (where legal title remains with the Company). A contract arises on the acceptance of a customer's purchase order, which is typically executed in writing.\nWe distribute devices and other hardware to certain small fleet operators and consumers through distributors. Distributors act as agents and hardware revenue is only recognized when the distributor sells the hardware unit to the end customer. Once a unit is sold to a customer, the customer enters into a service agreement directly with the Company. The obligation to supply the service and the credit risk rests with us. The subscription revenue is recognized when the service is rendered.\nWe also sell hardware to motor vehicle dealerships for fitment into their vehicle trading stock. These dealerships purchase the hardware from us and are considered to act as a principal in the contract because they obtain title to the hardware, bear the risks and rewards of ownership and accordingly control the hardware purchased. The buyer of the vehicle then enters into a service-only contract with us. Revenue is recognized upon sale of the hardware to the dealership and subscription revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the customer.\nWe distribute devices and other hardware to enterprise fleet customers through dealers. Dealers are considered to act as a principal for the sale of hardware to the end customer, and revenue is recognized by us upon sale of the hardware unit to\nthe dealer. Dealers are also considered to act as a principal for the provision of the service to end customers because, even though the dealers do not provide the service themselves, the dealers control the right to receive the service before that right is transferred to the end customer, the dealers have the primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide the service to the end customer, and the dealers have full discretion in establishing the prices charged to the end customer. Accordingly, subscription revenue is recognized as the service is provided to the dealers.\nDeferred commissions\nCommissions incurred to acquire contracts are capitalized and amortized, unless the amortization period is 12 months or less. The commission capitalized is attributed to the specific performance obligations in the related contract. Commission is considered commensurate with respect to a particular contract when equivalent/comparable commission is payable upon the extension or renewal of such a contract or upon the customer entering into a new contract. To the extent commission capitalized is commensurate, the commission attributable to service will be amortized over the minimum contractual period or, if shorter, the expected life of the contract. To the extent it is not commensurate, the commission capitalized that is attributable to service is amortized over the expected life of the contract. Typically, with regard to month-to-month contracts, commission payable is not considered commensurate for such contracts because no commission is payable as and when the customer extends each month by not giving notice. Accordingly, commission incurred on such contracts that is attributable to service is amortized over the expected life of the contract taking account of expected extensions/renewals.\nRecurring commission is commission which is payable for each month the customer remains with us. The amount capitalized reflects the total commission payable over the minimum contractual period or, if shorter, the expected life of the contract, together with the effect of the time value of money, where significant.\nAmortization expense of external commissions capitalized is recognized in cost of sales, while that of internal commissions is recognized in sales and marketing costs. Commissions not capitalized under the 12-month practical expedient are also classified in the same manner.\nPrior to the adoption of ASC 606, commissions incurred to acquire contracts were recognized as expenses as incurred.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivables is calculated by considering all relevant information, internal and external about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to appropriately reflect the risk of losses over the remaining contractual life of an asset. Historical loss rates, calculated as actual losses over a period as a percentage of revenue, are adjusted for current conditions and management's expectations about future economic conditions.\nThe allowance is measured on a collective basis where management groups their customers appropriately based on their credit risk characteristics.\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is a valuation account and the asset's carrying amount is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Actual write-downs are recorded when the asset is deemed uncollectible after all efforts to recover have yielded no results.\nWe have adopted ASC 326 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses ( ASC 326\u201d) effective April 1, 2019. Prior to this date the allowance for doubtful accounts was determined on an incurred-loss basis.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for possible impairment at least annually, or when circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Goodwill is allocated to a reporting unit for the purpose of impairment testing. No impairments of goodwill existed as of the last testing date, March 31, 2020 or the previous testing, March 31, 2019. The changes in the carrying value of goodwill during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 are attributable only to foreign currency translation adjustments.\nAlthough there were no impairments of goodwill as of March 31, 2020, significant judgement was exercised in determining the fair value of each reporting unit, especially in light of COVID-19, which has had and, we believe, will continue to have an adverse impact on global economies and financial markets. In particular, to the extent that anticipated new contracts do not materialize and the business strategy does not come to fruition, or key personnel are not retained, the forecasts on which the impairment tests were performed could be negatively impacted.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nIntangible assets that are not ready for use are not subject to amortization but are assessed annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired.\nLong-lived assets that are subject to amortization or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nAn asset is written down immediately to its fair value if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its future undiscounted cash flows. Recognized impairment losses are not reversed.\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.\nIntangible Assets\nInternal-use software and technology\nJudgements and estimates occur in the calculation and capitalization of internal-use software and technology. We capitalize as intangible assets, internal-use software acquired or developed solely to meet our internal needs. Costs, excluding general and administrative costs, are capitalized from the date on which management implicitly or explicitly authorizes, or commits to fund, the project, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will perform the intended function (application development stage). All costs incurred during the preliminary development stage are expensed. Capitalization ceases when the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended use.\nCosts, including annual licenses, associated with maintaining computer software programs, and training costs are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred for upgrades and enhancements (modifications to existing internal-use software that provides additional functionality) are capitalized during the application development stage.\nSoftware capitalized is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life ranging from 1 to 18 years, commencing on the date when the software is ready for its intended use. Judgements and estimates are used in the determination of these useful lives.\nComputer Software for External Use\nJudgements and estimates occur in the calculation and capitalization of computer software for external use. Computer software for external use refers to the firmware that is developed for the devices and other hardware provided us to our customers. The costs of developing firmware are expensed as incurred prior to the establishment of its technological feasibility, from which point the development costs are capitalized and recognized as intangible assets. For the periods presented, technological feasibility could only be demonstrated shortly before the release of the firmware, and as a result, the development costs that meet the requirements for capitalization are not material.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\nThe cost of in-vehicle devices installed in vehicles (including installation and shipping costs) as well as the cost of uninstalled in-vehicle devices, is capitalized as property and equipment. We depreciate installed in-vehicle devices on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, commencing upon installation, whereas uninstalled in-vehicle devices are not depreciated until installed. The related depreciation expense is recorded as part of cost of revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nDepreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to reduce their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives.\nThe assets' useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.\nRight-of-use assets are included in property and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nTaxation\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. Where applicable tax legislation is subject to interpretation, management makes assessments, based on expert tax advice, of the relevant tax that is more likely than not to be paid and provides accordingly.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Income tax expense is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. The Company uses the portfolio approach for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income.\nThe current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws and tax rates enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Interest, and penalties, incurred on the underpayment of income taxes is classified as interest expense, and administration expenses, respectively.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax is measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Uncertainty generated by the current economic environment may affect the valuation of our deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax balances and associated valuation allowances represent management's best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimate.\nManagement periodically evaluates its tax positions with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. For uncertainties in income tax positions if it is more likely than not that some tax benefit will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position, then the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more likely than not that some tax benefit will be sustained, then zero tax benefit is recognized. As of March 31, 2018 and 2019, there was an uncertain tax position in respect of certain tax deductions, related to tax years prior to 2017, that were disallowed. No tax benefit was recognized because it was not considered more likely than not that the tax benefit would be realized. After a lengthy legal process, approval for the tax deductions was received in January 2020, resulting in the recognition of a current tax asset of $0.5 million. There were no material uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2020.\nDeferred tax liabilities arising on investments in domestic subsidiaries are not recognized to the extent that the investment can be recovered on a tax-free basis; and on investments in foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the undistributed earnings will be invested indefinitely or will be remitted in a tax-free liquidation.\nQuarterly results of operations\nThe table below sets out our quarterly results for each of the eight quarters in the period ending March 31, 2020.\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>

Subscription revenue growth is primarily due to increases in the number of total subscribers in each quarter.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe do not engage in any off-balance sheet financing activities. We do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities, which include special purpose entities and other structured finance entities which are not consolidated.\nTabular disclosure of contractual obligations\nAs a smaller reporting company\u201d, we are not required to provide this information.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our future results may vary materially from those indicated as a result of the risks that affect our business, including, among others, those identified in Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nOverview\nWe are a leading global provider of fleet and mobile asset management solutions delivered as SaaS. Our solutions deliver a measurable return by enabling our customers to manage, optimize and protect their investments in commercial fleets, mobile assets or personal vehicles. We generate actionable intelligence that enables a wide range of customers, from large enterprise fleets to small fleet operators and consumers, to reduce fuel and other operating costs, improve efficiency, enhance regulatory compliance, promote driver safety, manage risk and mitigate theft. Our solutions mostly rely on our proprietary, highly scalable technology platforms, which allows us to collect, analyze and deliver information based on data from our customers' vehicles. Using intuitive, web-based interface, reports or mobile applications, our fleet customers can access large volumes of real-time and historical data, monitor the location and status of their drivers and vehicles and analyze a wide number of key metrics across their fleet operations.\nIn fiscal year 2020, we collected data on an average of approximately 193 million trips per month representing as many as 10.1 billion vehicle locations per month. We have a global presence, with subscribers located in over 120 countries across six continents for whom we collectively tracked and managed over 818,000 subscribers at March 31, 2020.\nWe were founded in 1996 and we have offices in South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uganda, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, Romania, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates as well as a network of more than 130 fleet partners worldwide. MiX Telematics shares are publicly traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE: MIX) and MiX Telematics American Depositary Shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: MIXT).\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from subscriptions to our fleet and mobile asset management solutions. Our subscriptions generally include access to our SaaS solutions, connectivity, and in many cases, use of an in-vehicle device. We also generate revenues from the sale of in-vehicle devices, which enable customers to use our subscription-based solutions, installation services of our in-vehicle-devices and driver training for fleet customers. We generate sales through the efforts of our direct sales teams, staffed in our regional sales offices, and through our global network of distributors and dealers. Our direct sales teams focus on marketing our fleet solutions to global and multinational enterprise accounts and to other large customer accounts located in regions of the world where we maintain a direct sales presence. Our direct sales teams have industry expertise across multiple industries, including oil and gas, transportation and logistics, government and municipal, bus and coach, rental and leasing, and utilities. In some markets, we rely on a network of distributors and dealers to sell our solutions on our behalf. Our distributors and dealers also install our in-vehicle devices and provide training, technical support and ongoing maintenance for the customers they support.\nThrough March 31, 2020, we were subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act applicable to foreign private issuers ( FPIs\u201d). We therefore prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ( IFRS\u201d). As of April 1, 2020 we transitioned to domestic filer status and, therefore, our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2020 were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The financial information for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 in the discussion below has been presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nWe believe the large and growing market for fleet and mobile asset management solutions will provide us with significant growth opportunities going forward. We seek to capitalize on these growth opportunities and manage the factors affecting our performance, including the level of subscription and hardware revenues, fluctuations in the value of the South African Rand (our functional currency), an evolving mix of subscribers with different revenue and cost economics, varying economic conditions in our markets (e.g., the oil and gas sector), changing customer needs and long\nsales cycles for our enterprise fleet management solutions. See Factors Affecting Our Performance\u201d, for more information on these factors.\nWe intend to grow our revenue by adding new customers, selling more subscriptions to existing customers, and expanding our customer base to include industry sectors, customer segments and geographic regions beyond those that we currently serve. We will also continue to evolve our portfolio of products and services by introducing new innovative solutions.\nImpact of COVID-19\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported in China ( COVID-19\u201d). In January 2020, the World Health Organization ( WHO\u201d) declared this outbreak a Public Health Emergency of international concern and, subsequently, it was declared a pandemic in March 2020. The outbreak continued to spread globally, affecting global economic activity and financial markets. We are unable to accurately predict the impact that COVID-19 will have due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact on our customers and other factors identified in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors - The extent to which the coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) outbreak and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict.\" in this Form 10-K.\nBusiness, employees and operations\nDue to extensive measures implemented by various governments, all of our employees were required to work remotely, with the exception of our staff working in our monitoring centers, which were classified as an essential service. We have implemented appropriate safeguards for these centers. In addition, we have modified certain business and workforce practices (including extended work from home requirements, suspension of certain business travel and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) and implemented new protocols to promote social distancing and enhance sanitary measures in our offices and facilities to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by governmental and regulatory authorities.\nCOVID-19 has disrupted the operations of our customers and channel partners, our operations and the results of our operations. COVID-19 currently has had and, we believe, will continue to have an adverse impact on global economies and financial markets. For example the continued economic uncertainty in the oil and gas sector has resulted in significant declines in our customer's fleet sizes whilst similar disruption is evident in our bus and coach vertical following significantly reduced demand for public transport as a result of various governmental shut downs in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate in. This has and will continue to have a negative impact on our revenue and our results of operations, the size and duration of which we are currently unable to predict. During the last month of fiscal 2020 we experienced a small contraction in our subscriber base as a result of the impact of COVID 19, we expect this net contraction to continue into fiscal year 2021, and this together with certain pricing concessions, is likely to result in a decrease in reported subscription revenues.\nCash resources and liquidity\nBased on our internal projections we believe that we have sufficient cash reserves to support us for the foreseeable future. Further details on our cash resources and borrowings available under our credit facilities are provided in the liquidity and capital resources section below.\nFinancial position and impairments\nWe have taken into account the impact of COVID-19, to the extent possible, on our financial statements as at reporting date. However, future changes in economic conditions related to COVID-19 could have an impact on future estimates and judgements used, particularly those relating to Goodwill sensitivities and impairment assessments, as well as expected credit losses. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition.\nKey Financial Measures and Operating Metrics\nIn addition to financial measures based on our consolidated financial statements, we monitor our business operations using various financially and non-financially derived metrics.\nSubscription Revenue\nSubscription revenue represents subscription fees for our solutions, which include the use of our SaaS fleet management solutions, connectivity, and in many cases, our in-vehicle devices. Our subscription revenue is driven primarily by the number of subscribers and the monthly price per subscriber, which varies depending on the services and features customers require, hardware options, customer size and geographic location.\nSubscription revenue has increased as a percentage of total revenue. In fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020, subscription revenue represented 83.8%, 85.7% and 87.6% respectively, of our total revenue. In fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020, our top 10 customers represented 24.5%, 24.9% and 23.7% respectively, of our subscription revenue.\nSubscribers\nSubscribers represent the total number of discrete services we provide to customers at the end of the period.\n\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nLevel of Subscription Revenue and Hardware Revenue\nWe have historically been focused on growing our recurring subscription revenue base and entering into more fully bundled deals. As a result of an increase in the total subscriber base, and due to new and existing subscribers moving to fully-bundled subscriptions, subscription revenue has increased as a percentage of revenue. In fiscal year 2020, subscription-based revenues accounted for 87.6% of our total revenues, up from 85.7% in 2019 and 83.8% in 2018. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the level of business disruption as a result of the spread of COVID-19, the Company suspended its practice of issuing financial guidance and expects that subscription revenue could decline in fiscal 2021.\nAs market conditions improve globally, we believe that we will be well positioned to grow our base of subscribers, by adding both fully-bundled subscriptions; subscriptions where the hardware has been purchased upfront and various add-on solutions that can drive incremental average revenue per user ( ARPU\u201d) expansion over time. We intend to maintain our investment in sales and marketing and continue to attract new subscribers by introducing attractive new features and services.\nAdditionally, we believe we have the opportunity to expand our fleet management market share among our existing customer base by demonstrating our value proposition, growing with the customer, introducing new and innovative value-added solutions and displacing legacy fleet management solutions.\nFluctuations in Exchange Rates\nRevenue from our international operations has historically represented a substantial portion of our total revenue. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect our reported income and expenses as expressed in U.S. dollars (our reporting currency). The South African Rand is the functional currency for the Company. Currency fluctuations in the South African Rand may positively or negatively impact our reported income and expenses due to the effects of translating the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries into Rand at different average exchange rates and then translating into our reporting currency of U.S. Dollars.\nIn fiscal year 2020, the Rand weakened by 7.5% against the U.S. Dollar and by 4.2% against the British Pound, as shown in the table below.\n\nWe expect continued exchange rate volatility in the South African Rand against other major currencies. The South African Rand has been even more volatile due to the uncertain economic conditions including the effect of COVID-19 and it is uncertain how long this will continue. As of July 21, 2020, the South African Rand/U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 16.51, 11.7% weaker than the average exchange rate for fiscal 2020. We expect a near-term impact on our financial results based on the more than 20% weakening of the South African Rand year-over-year.\nMix of Subscribers with Different Revenue and Cost Economics\nWe offer services to a wide range of customers, from large enterprise vehicle fleets to small fleet operators and consumers. The subscription revenue and cost per subscriber and the subscriber retention pattern differ by type of subscriber. For example, our entry-level consumer solution, Beam-e, is characterized by lower revenue and lower cost per subscriber compared to our large enterprise solutions. Small fleet and consumer customers will enter into and terminate contracts much more frequently than our enterprise customers, thereby affecting subscriber retention. As the mix of our subscriber base evolves, the average revenue per subscriber and average cost per subscriber is likely to change.\nVarying Economic Conditions in our Markets\nWe seek to capitalize on opportunities and manage risks in our key markets, which are geographically dispersed with subscribers located in more than 120 countries worldwide. Overall, we believe that our presence across multiple geographic markets and our exposure to multiple economies provides us with diversification from the risk of changing economic conditions in any one country or region. Other macroeconomic factors, such as expectations for future crude oil and natural gas prices, affect our customers' spending habits. Prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil and/or natural gas prices, or the perception that such prices will decrease in the future, negatively impacts our net subscriber growth and hardware sales in this sector. In addition to macroeconomic changes, performance in any given region may vary due to multiple factors, including growth in subscribers, the overall profile of the customer base (for example, in Africa, we have a significant consumer subscriber base), the services and hardware options selected by particular subscribers and our distribution strategy in the region.\nChanges in regional conditions require management to formulate strategic responses that safeguard our financial position and maintain our balanced approach to producing revenue growth, profitability and cash flow.\nChanging Customer Needs and Ongoing Investment in Technology\nWe continuously analyze market trends and opportunities in the various geographies in which we operate and have identified an opportunity to increase subscription revenue growth by the addition of new products and services in certain of the regions in which we operate. Our investment in software development is core to our business strategy. Our software teams employ an agile software development methodology. We have made a significant investment in product development, and we have routinely been among the first to market with innovative solutions and features that cater to the needs of our customers. For example, in fiscal 2019 we launched MiX Now our self-service, plug and play offering for small fleet operators. This easy to use system helps companies monitor and manage the behavior and performance of their vehicles and drivers.\nLong Sales Cycle for Our Enterprise Fleet Management Solutions\nFrom period to period, our revenues may fluctuate depending upon the customer contracts we have secured. The typical sales cycle for large enterprise fleet management solutions contracts may be long, especially by comparison to the sales cycle for our consumer solutions. It may also be difficult for us to predict the timing of when we will enter into enterprise fleet management contracts.\nLonger sales cycles for large contracts, for both customers who purchase in-vehicle devices and those who opt for the fully bundled option, may affect the comparability of financial results in certain segments. Our revenue may fluctuate from period to period depending on the level and timing of hardware sales, while subscription revenue growth is also impacted by the timing of the rollout of large enterprise fleets. We are focused on mitigating these long sales cycles and the associated volatility by enhancing our sales pipeline management process, by increasing our sales and marketing investment levels (due to investments in the Americas) and by diversifying our customer segment focus.\nInvestment in Sales and Marketing\nWe offer our solutions in over 120 countries through a combination of our direct and indirect marketing efforts. Our sales and marketing strategy is segmented by geographic region and customer type in order to cost effectively target and acquire new customers. In certain regions, we sell subscriptions of our fleet management solutions to large enterprise fleets through our direct sales force. In other regions, and for sales to small fleet operators and consumers, we work with an extensive distribution network of regional partners and national distribution dealers. Through our central services organization headquartered in South Africa, we provide common marketing, product management, technical and distribution support to each of our regional sales and marketing operations. We continue to focus on growth and expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our customer base and to expand within existing customers.\nBasis of Presentation and Key Components of Our Results of Operations\nIn fiscal year 2020, we managed our business in six segments which include Africa, Americas, Brazil, Europe and the Middle East and Australasia (our regional sales offices ( RSOs\u201d)), and our CSO. CSO is our central services organization that wholesales our products and services to our RSOs which, in turn, interface with our end-customers, distributors and dealers. CSO is also responsible for the development of our hardware and software platforms and provides common marketing, product management, technical and distribution support to each of our other operating segments.\nThe CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the reportable segments, has been identified collectively as the executive committee and the Chief Executive Officer who make strategic decisions. Segment performance is measured and evaluated by the CODM using Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure which uses net income, determined under International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS\u201d) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, as a starting point. Prior to the publication of the financial results for the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company published results under IFRS only, which is the reason for the CODM using a segment performance measure based on IFRS.\nIn determining Segment Adjusted EBITDA, the margin generated by CSO, net of any unrealized intercompany profit, is allocated to the geographic region where the external revenue is recorded by our RSOs. The costs remaining in CSO relate mainly to research and development of hardware and software platforms, common marketing, product management and technical and distribution support to each of the RSOs.\nEach RSO's results therefore reflects the external revenue earned, as well as the Segment Adjusted EBITDA earned (or loss incurred) before the remaining CSO and corporate costs allocations. Segment assets are not disclosed as this information is not reviewed by the CODM.\nRevenue\nThe majority of our revenue is subscription-based. Consequently, growth in subscribers influences our subscription revenue growth. However, other factors, including, but not limited to, the types of new subscribers we add and the timing of entry into subscription contracts also play a significant role. The price and terms of our customer subscription contracts vary based on a number of factors, including fleet size, hardware options, geographic region and distribution channel. In addition, we derive revenue from the sale of in-vehicle devices, which are used to collect, generate and transmit the data used to enable our SaaS solutions.\nOur customer contracts typically have a three to five year initial term. Following the initial term, most fleet customers elect to renew for fixed terms ranging from one to five years. Our third party dealers are typically billed monthly based on active connections. Some of our customer agreements, including our consumer subscriptions, provide for automatic monthly or yearly renewals unless the customer elects not to renew its subscription. Our consumer customer contracts in South Africa are governed by the Consumer Protection Act, which allows customers to cancel without paying\nthe full balance of the contract amount. Our fleet contracts and our customer contracts outside of South Africa are generally non-cancellable.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue associated with our subscription revenue consists primarily of costs related to cellular communications, infrastructure hosting, third-party data providers, service contract maintenance costs, commission expense related to third party dealers or distributors (commission is capitalized and amortized unless the amortization period is 12 months or less) and depreciation of our capitalized installed in-vehicle devices. Cost of sales associated with our hardware revenue includes the cost of the in-vehicle devices, cost of hardware warranty, shipping costs, custom duties, and commission expense related to third party dealers or distributors. We capitalize the cost of in-vehicle devices utilized to service customers, for customers selecting our bundled option, and we depreciate these costs from the date of installation over their expected useful lives.\nWe expect that cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue will vary from period to period depending on our revenue mix, including the proportion of our revenue attributable to our subscription-based services. The majority of the other components of our cost of revenue are variable and are affected by the number of subscribers, the composition of our subscriber base, and the number of new subscriptions sold in the period.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages to sales and marketing employees, commissions paid to employees, travel-related expenses, and advertising and promotional costs. We pay our sales employees commissions based on achieving subscription targets and we capitalize commission and amortize it (unless the amortization period is 12 months or less). Advertising costs consist primarily of costs for print, radio and television advertising, promotions, public relations, customer events, tradeshows and sponsorships. We expense advertising costs as incurred. We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing in order to grow our sales and build brand and category awareness.\nAdministration and Other Charges\nAdministration and other charges consist primarily of salaries and wages for administrative staff, travel costs, professional fees (including audit and legal fees), real estate leasing costs, expensed research and development costs and depreciation of fixed assets including vehicles and office equipment and amortization of intangible assets. We expect that administration and other charges will increase in absolute terms as we continue to grow our business.\nResearch and Development\nFor additional disclosures in respect of research and development, technology and intellectual property please refer to Item 1. Business\u201d\nTaxes\nIn fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020 our effective tax rates were 15.4%, 39.9% and 47.2% respectively, compared to a South African statutory rate of 28%. Taxation mainly consists of normal statutory income tax paid or payable and deferred tax on any temporary differences.\nOur effective tax rate may vary primarily according to the mix of profits made in various jurisdictions and the impact of certain non-deductible/(non-taxable) foreign exchange movements. A reconciliation of the actual tax rate to the South African tax rate of 28% is disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. As a result, significant variances in future periods may occur.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nWe use certain measures to assess the financial performance of its business. Certain of these measures are termed non-GAAP measures\u201d because they exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or are calculated using financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share.\nAn explanation of the relevance of each of the non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and a discussion of their limitations is set out below. We do not regard these non-GAAP measures as a substitute for, or superior to, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP or those calculated using financial measures that are calculated in accordance with U.S.GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are two of the profit measures reviewed by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM\u201d). We define Adjusted EBITDA as the income before income taxes, net interest income, net foreign exchange gains/(losses), depreciation of property and equipment including capitalized customer in-vehicle devices, amortization of intangible assets including capitalized internal-use software development costs and intangible assets identified as part of a business combination, stock-based compensation costs, restructuring costs and profits/(losses) on the disposal or impairments of assets or subsidiaries. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in this annual report because they are key measures that the Company's management and Board of Directors use to understand and evaluate its core operating performance and trends; to prepare and approve its annual budget; and to develop short and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of the Company's core business. Accordingly, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results.\nA reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the year, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with U.S GAAP is presented below.\n\n(1) Includes depreciation of owned property and equipment (including in-vehicle devices).\n(2) Includes amortization of intangible assets (including intangible assets identified as part of a business combination).\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these performance measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.\nSome of these limitations are:\n\u2022although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to the Company;\n\u2022other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure; and\n\u2022certain of the adjustments (such as restructuring costs, impairment of long-lived assets and others) made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA are those that management believes are not representative of our underlying operations and, therefore, are subjective in nature.\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial performance measures, including income from operations, net income and our other results.\nBasic and Diluted non-GAAP Net Income per share\nNon-GAAP net income is defined as net income excluding net foreign exchange gains/(losses) net of tax.\nWe have included non-GAAP earnings per share in this annual report because it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business by excluding net foreign exchange gains/(losses) net of tax and associated tax consequences from earnings. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP earnings per share provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results.\n\nConstant Currency Information\nConstant currency information has been presented in the sections below to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on the Company's results. The constant currency information has been determined by adjusting the current financial reporting year's results to the prior year's average exchange rates, determined as the average of the monthly exchange rates applicable to the year. The measurement has been performed for each of the Company's currencies, including the South African Rand and British Pound. The constant currency growth percentage has been calculated by utilizing the constant currency results compared to the prior year results.\nThe constant currency information represents non-GAAP information. We believe this provides a useful basis to measure the performance of our business as it removes distortion from the effects of foreign currency movements during the period.\nDue to the significant portion of our customers who are invoiced in non-U.S. Dollar denominated currencies, we also calculate our subscription revenue growth rate on a constant currency basis, thereby removing the effect of currency fluctuation on our results of operations.\nRefer to discussion below for the annual constant currency growth. The following tables provide the constant currency reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for the fiscal years shown:\nSubscription Revenue\n\nHardware and Other Revenue\n\nTotal Revenue\n\nThe table below shows our year over year subscription revenue growth rate per quarter on both an actual and constant currency basis.\nSubscription Revenue\n\nThe following tables provide the constant currency reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for the quarters shown:\nSubscription Revenue\n\n\n\n\nResults of operations\nThe following table sets forth certain Consolidated Statement of Income data:\n\nResults of Operations for Fiscal Year 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020\nRevenue\n\nOur total revenue increased by $1.9 million or 1.4%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased by 6.3% from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. The principal factors affecting our revenue growth included:\n\u2022Subscription revenue grew by $4.4 million, or 3.6% from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. Subscription revenue represented 87.6% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020 compared to 85.7% for the prior year. Our growth in subscription revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in subscribers, which increased by 9.1% from 750,455 at March 31, 2019, to 818,487 at March 31, 2020. There was no material movement in ARPUs from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue increased by 8.7% from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020.\n\u2022Hardware and other revenue decreased by $2.5 million, or 12.0%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020.\nA breakdown of third party revenue by segment is shown in the table below:\n\nIn the Africa segment, subscription revenue increased by $0.4 million, or 0.5%. On a constant currency basis, the growth in subscription revenue was 7.5% as a result of a 8.6% increase in subscribers since April 1, 2019. Total revenue increased by $0.8 million or 1.0%. Hardware and other revenue increased by $0.4 million or 7.6%. On a constant currency basis, total revenue growth was 8.0%.\nIn the Americas segment subscription revenue growth was $1.0 million or 4.9%. Subscribers increased by 1.5% since April 1, 2019. Total revenue improved by $0.6 million, or 2.5%.\nSubscription revenue in the Middle East and Australasia segment increased by $1.0 million or 5.8%. On a constant currency basis, the increase in subscription revenue was 9.3%. Subscribers increased by 10.5% since April 1, 2019. Total revenue declined by $0.4 million, or 1.7%. Hardware and other revenue declined by $1.4 million, or 19.0%. Total revenue in constant currency improved by 1.7%.\nIn the Europe segment subscription revenue growth was $1.5 million, or 14.3%. On a constant currency basis, the growth in subscription revenue was 18.0%. Subscribers increased by 10.8% since April 1, 2019 and additional growth is attributable to an increase in high ARPU bundled subscribers. Despite the increase in subscription revenue total revenue declined by $0.2 million, or 1.5%, due to $1.7 million lower hardware and other revenues compared to fiscal 2019. Total revenue increased by 1.7% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the Brazil segment subscription revenue increased by $0.5 million, or 11.3%. On a constant currency basis, the increase in subscription revenue was 20.9%. The increase was due to an increase in subscribers of 25.9% since April 1, 2019. Total revenue increased by $0.8 million, or 16.5%. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased by 26.5%.\nCost of Revenue\n\nCompared to an increase in total revenue of $1.9 million, or 1.4%, cost of revenues increased by $6.1 million, or 13.1%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. This resulted in a lower gross profit margin of 63.6% in fiscal year 2020 compared to 67.4% in fiscal year 2019.\nDuring fiscal 2020, subscription revenue gross profit margins were lower than in fiscal 2019, mainly due to accelerated depreciation of in-vehicle devices following contraction in certain fleets in the oil and gas vertical in the Americas segment.\nDuring fiscal 2020, hardware and other margins were lower than in fiscal 2019, mainly due to the geographical sales mix and the distribution channels. Hardware sales via our dealer channel attract lower gross margins. In addition there is pricing pressure on hardware pries as customers look to reduce the upfront cost of their investment.\nSales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing costs decreased by $1.2 million, or 8.0%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020 against a 1.4% increase in total revenue. The decrease in fiscal year 2020 was primarily as a result of a $0.5 million decrease in bonuses, a $0.5 million decrease in salaries and wages, a $0.1 million decrease in foreign travel costs and other decreases of $0.1 million, none of which were individually significant. In fiscal year 2020, sales and marketing costs represented 9.1% of revenue compared to 10.1% of revenue in fiscal year 2019.\nAdministration and Other Expenses\n\nAdministration and other expenses increased by $0.2 million, or 0.4%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020.\nThe increase mainly relates to increases in expected credit loss provision primarily in the South Africa business of $1.9 million mainly, professional fees of $0.9 million, offset by saving in bonuses of $1.3 million primarily due to lower subscription revenue growth being achieved, salaries and wages of $0.8 million and operating lease costs of $0.4 million.\nTaxation\n\nIncome tax expense increased by 0.1%, while our effective tax rate increased by 7.3% to 47.2% in fiscal year 2020. A reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the South African corporate tax rate of 28% for both fiscal years 2020 and 2019, is presented in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. In fiscal year 2020 the effective tax rate increased by 19.6% as a result of certain non-deductible foreign exchange movements on intercompany loans which have lead to deferred tax charges being recognized in the Income Statement. In fiscal 2019 non-deductible foreign exchange differences increased the tax rate by 14.0%.\nResults of Operations for Fiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019\nRevenue\n\nOur total revenue increased by $11.9 million, or 9.0%, from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased by 13.5% from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019. The principal factors affecting our revenue growth included:\n\u2022Subscription revenue grew by $12.8 million, or 11.5% from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019. Subscription revenue represented 85.7% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2019 compared to 83.8% for the prior year. Our\ngrowth in subscription revenue is primarily attributable to both an increase in subscribers, which increased by 10.9% from 676,866 at March 31, 2018, to 750,455 at March 31, 2019 and an increase in ARPU. We again saw ARPU expansion in certain regions such as Brazil and the Americas, where our fleet ARPUs have continued to increase as a result of bundled deals. Further information in this regard is shown below as part of the discussion of third party revenue and subscription revenue by geography. On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue increased by 16.3% from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019.\n\u2022Hardware and other revenue decreased by $0.8 million, or 3.9%, from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019.\nA breakdown of third party revenue by segment is shown in the table below:\n\nIn the Africa segment, subscription revenue increased by $3.4 million, or 5.0%. On a constant currency basis, the growth in subscription revenue was 11.1% as a result of a 10.4% increase in subscribers since April 1, 2018. Total revenue increased by $2.3 million, or 3.1%. Hardware and other revenue declined by $1.1 million, or 16.4%. On a constant currency basis, total revenue growth was 9.1%.\nThe Americas was the fastest growing geographical region during fiscal 2019 at a subscription revenue level. Subscription revenue growth was $6.3 million, or 41.9%. Subscribers increased by 15.7% since April 1, 2018. Subscription revenue received assistance from the market's ongoing preference for bundled deals across new and existing customers. Total revenue improved by $6.4 million, or 36.6%.\nSubscription revenue in the Middle East and Australasia segment increased by $1.0 million, or 6.7%. On a constant currency basis, the increase in subscription revenue was 9.6%. Subscribers increased by 8.1% since April 1, 2018. Total revenue improved by $2.1 million, or 9.7%. Hardware and other revenue increased by $1.1 million, or 17.5%. Total revenue in constant currency improved by 13.0%.\nIn the Europe segment subscription revenue growth was $1.4 million, or 15.3%. On a constant currency basis, the growth in subscription revenue was 16.4%. However, total revenue only increased by $0.4 million, or 2.6% due to $1.0 million lower hardware and other revenues compared to fiscal 2018. Total revenue increased by 3.6% on a constant currency basis. Subscribers increased by 9.0% since April 1, 2018.\nIn the Brazil segment subscription revenue increased by $0.7 million, or 19.2%. On a constant currency basis, the increase in subscription revenue was 40.1%. The increase was due to the market's preference for bundled deals and an increase in subscribers of 28.2% since April 1, 2018. Total revenue increased by $0.8 million, or 18.8%. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased by 39.6%.\nCost of Revenue\n\nCompared to an increase in total revenue of $11.9 million, or 9.0%, cost of revenues increased by $2.8 million, or 6.3%, from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019. This resulted in a higher gross profit margin of 67.4% in fiscal year 2019 compared to 66.5% in fiscal year 2018.\nSubscription revenue, which generates a higher gross profit margin than hardware and other revenue, contributed 85.7% of total revenue compared to 83.8% in fiscal year 2018.\nSales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing costs increased by $0.3 million, or 1.8%, from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019 against a 9.0% increase in total revenue. This was as a result of strict cost management as the Company achieved greater economies of scale. The increase in fiscal year 2019 was primarily as a result of a $0.2 million increase in advertising spend and other increases of $0.1 million, none of which were individually significant. In fiscal year 2019, sales and marketing costs represented 10.1% of revenue compared to 10.8% of revenue in fiscal year 2018.\nOn a constant currency basis sales and marketing costs increased by $1.1 million, or 7.7%. During fiscal year 2019, the increases in sales and marketing costs related primarily to our additional investments in the Americas segment, which were incurred to enhance our growth outside of the oil and gas vertical in such segment.\nAdministration and Other Expenses\n\nAdministration and other expenses increased by $0.8 million, or 1.3%, from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019.The increase mainly relates to increases in IT costs of $0.5 million and professional fees of $0.4 million.\nTaxation\n\nTaxation expense increased by $7.3 million, or 287%, while our effective tax rate increased by 24.5% to 39.9% in fiscal year 2019. A reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the South African corporate tax rate of 28% for both fiscal years 2019 and 2018, is presented in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. In fiscal year 2019 the effective tax rate increased by 14.0% as a result of certain non-deductible foreign exchange movements. In fiscal 2018 non-taxable foreign exchange differences decreased the tax rate by 13.2%. Further information is set out in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the last three fiscal years. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset these higher costs through price increases. Our inability to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nWe believe that our cash and borrowings available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.\nThe following tables provide a summary of our cash flows for each of the three years ended March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020:\n\nThe Company has minimum liquidity risk due to the recurring nature of its income and the availability of the cash resources set out below:\n\nWe fund our operations, capital expenditure and acquisitions through cash generated from operating activities, cash on hand and our undrawn borrowing facilities.\nAs of March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Company had approved, but not yet contracted, capital commitments for intangible assets of $4.8 million, $3.6 million and $3.0 million respectively.\nAs of March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Company had approved, and contracted, capital commitments for property and equipment of $1.0 million, $2.8 million and $1.8 million, respectively; and for intangible assets of $1.4 million, $1.3 million and $0.9 million respectively.\nCapital commitments will be funded out of a mixture of working capital and cash and cash equivalents.\nFollowing the completion of our IPO of ADSs in fiscal year 2014, we discontinued our then policy of declaring regular dividends in order to increase the funds available to pursue opportunities for more rapid growth. During fiscal year 2016, after a strategic review, the Board decided to reintroduce the Company's policy of paying regular dividends, which are considered on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\nOn May 23, 2017, the MiX Telematics Limited Board approved a share repurchase program of up to R270 million (equivalent of $15 million as of March 31, 2020) under which the Company may repurchase its ordinary shares, including ADSs. We expect any repurchases under this share repurchase program to be funded out of existing cash resources. Refer to Item 5. Market for Registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities\u201d for information regarding our share repurchase program.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash generated from operating activities during fiscal year 2018 consisted of our net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $36.9 million, a net investment in operating assets and liabilities of $6.3 million, net interest received of $0.4 million and taxes paid of $5.0 million.\nNet cash generated from operating activities increased from from $26.0 million in fiscal year 2018 to $31.5 million in fiscal year 2019, which is primarily attributable to improved net income (after excluding non-cash charges) before operating assets and liabilities changes of $10.7 million offset by negative net operating assets and liabilities changes of $4.4 million, higher net interest received of $0.3 million and increased taxation paid of $1.2 million. Net cash generated from operating activities during fiscal year 2019 consisted of our net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $47.6 million, a net investment in operating assets and liabilities of $10.6 million, net interest received of $0.7 million and taxes paid of $6.2 million.\nNet cash generated from operating activities decreased from $31.5 million in fiscal year 2019 to $28.2 million in fiscal year 2020 which is primarily attributable to more net income (after excluding non-cash charges) before operating assets and liabilities changes of $4.8 million offset by negative net operating assets and liabilities changes of $8.2 million, lower net interest received of $0.2 million and lower taxation paid of $0.4 million. Net cash generated from operating activities during fiscal year 2020 consisted of our net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $52.3 million, a net reduction in operating assets and liabilities investments of $18.8 million, net interest received of $0.5 million and taxes paid of $5.8 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2018 was $24.5 million. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2018 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $24.8 million. Capital expenditures during the year included purchases of intangible assets of $6.5 million, which included internal-use software of $4.0 million, customer relationships of $0.4 million, as well as computer software, technology and other intangibles of $2.1 million, and cash paid to purchase property, and equipment of $18.3 million, which included in-vehicle devices of $17.7 million. Offset by proceeds on sale of property and equipment and intangible assets of $0.3 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2019 decreased to $19.2 million from $24.5 million in fiscal year 2018. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2019 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $19.4 million. Capital expenditures during the year included purchases of intangible assets of $4.8 million, which included internal-use software of $3.5 million, as well as computer software, technology and other intangibles of $1.3 million, and cash paid to purchase property and equipment of $14.6 million, which included in-vehicle devices of $13.9 million. Offset by proceeds on sale of property and equipment and intangible assets of $0.2 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2020 increased to $19.4 million from $19.2 million in fiscal year 2019. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2020 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $20.4 million. Capital expenditures during the year included purchases of intangible assets of $5.7 million, which included internal-use software of $3.4 million as well as computer software, technology and other intangibles of $2.3 million, and cash paid to purchase property and equipment of $14.7 million, which included in-vehicle devices of $13.6 million. Net cash used in investing activities also included $0.3 million loan advanced to third parties offset by proceeds on sale of property and equipment and intangible assets of $1.3 million.\nFinancing Activities\nIn fiscal year 2018, the cash used in financing activities of $4.8 million consists of share repurchases of $1.4 million, dividends paid of $4.1 million and acquisition of non-controlling interest of $0.1 million, offset by proceeds from the issuance of shares in respect of employee stock options of $0.8 million.\nIn fiscal year 2019, the cash used in financing activities of $8.6 million includes share repurchases of $5.3 million, dividends paid of $4.9 million, offset by proceeds from issuance of shares in respect of employee stock options of $1.0 million and proceeds from the increase in short-term debt of $0.7 million.\nIn fiscal year 2020, the cash used in financing activities of $15.5 million includes share repurchases of $9.8 million, dividends paid of $6.0 million, offset by proceeds from short-term debt of $0.3 million.\nCredit Facilities\nAt March 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were net cash balances of $15.6 million (consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $18.0 million less short-term debt (bank overdraft)) of $2.4 million) and unutilized borrowing capacity of $3.6 million available through our credit facilities.\nOur principal sources of credit are our facilities with Standard Bank Limited and Nedbank Limited. We have an overdraft facility and an unutilized vehicle and asset finance facility of R8.5 million (equivalent of $0.5 million as of March 31, 2020) with Standard Bank Limited that bear interest at South African Prime less 1.2%. The Standard bank facility was amended during fiscal 2020, the overdraft was reduced from R70.0 million (equivalent of $3.9 million as of March 31, 2020) to R64.0 million (equivalent of $3.6 million as of March 31, 2020) and a working capital facility of R25.0 million (equivalent of $1.4 million as of March 31, 2020) was added. The working capital facility remains undrawn as of March 31, 2020.\nAt March 31, 2020, $2.4 million was utilized under the overdraft facility. We use this facility as part of our foreign currency hedging strategy. We draw down on this facility in the applicable foreign currency in order to fix the exchange rate on existing balance sheet foreign currency exposure that we anticipate settling in that foreign currency. Our obligations under the overdraft facility with Standard Bank Limited are guaranteed by the Company and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, MiX Telematics Africa Proprietary Limited and MiX Telematics International Proprietary Limited, and secured by a pledge of accounts receivable by the Company and MiX Telematics International Proprietary Limited.\nDuring fiscal year 2014, we entered into a R10.0 million (equivalent of $0.6 million as of March 31, 2020) facility from Nedbank Limited that bears interest at South African Prime less 2%. As of March 31, 2020, the facility was undrawn. We use this facility for working capital purposes in our Africa operations.\nOur credit facilities with Standard Bank Limited and Nedbank Limited contain certain restrictive clauses, including without limitation, those limiting our and our guarantor subsidiaries', as applicable, ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, or sell or acquire assets or businesses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain of our significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates are summarized below. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, the amortization period for deferred commissions, allowances for doubtful accounts, the assessment of expected cash flows used in evaluating goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, the determination of useful lives of the Company's customer relationships, contingencies, the classification of devices and other hardware as in-vehicle devices (equipment) versus inventory based on the future expectation of the different types of customer contracts, income and deferred taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. Our actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nEffective April 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d) using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Comparatives were not restated. The adoption resulted in the recognition of deferred commission assets of $3.8 million, an additional recurring commissions liability of $0.6 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $0.4 million, a contract asset of $0.1 million in respect of fixed escalations, and an increase in net deferred tax liabilities of $0.5 million, as of April 1, 2018. The net impact on retained earnings as of April 1, 2018 was $2.4 million. The impact of adoption on the Statement of Income for the year ended March 31, 2019 was not significant.\nSignificant Judgments\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of distinct promised products and/or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and/or services. We enter into contracts that include the supply of fleet and mobile asset management equipment. For such contracts, we utilize significant judgment to determine whether control of the equipment has transferred to the customer, and in instances where it does, we recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606. When control of the equipment does not transfer to the customer, which is when legal title does not transfer to the customer, our judgement is that the customer does not have the right to direct the use of the equipment when the customer does not operate the equipment or make any significant decisions about its use. In these instances the Company uses the equipment to provide fleet and mobile asset management services to the customer. Accordingly, these arrangements, which comprise virtually all of the transactions in which legal title does not pass to the customer, are not within the scope of ASC 842, Leases ( ASC 842\u201d). Instead, for such contracts we have concluded that they are service contracts comprising a single performance obligation, and revenue is recognized over time pursuant to ASC 606.\nRecognition and measurement\nWe provide fleet and mobile asset management solutions to our customers, and our principal revenue streams are (1) Subscription and (2) Hardware and other. Subscription revenue is recognized over time and hardware and other revenue is recognized at a point-in-time.\nTo provide services to customers, a device is required which collects and transmits information collected from the vehicle or other asset. Fleet customers may also obtain other items of hardware, virtually all of which are functionally-dependent on the device. Some customers obtain control of the device and other hardware (where legal title transfers to the customer); while other customers do not (where legal title remains with the Company). A contract arises on the acceptance of a customer's purchase order, which is typically executed in writing.\nWe distribute devices and other hardware to certain small fleet operators and consumers through distributors. Distributors act as agents and hardware revenue is only recognized when the distributor sells the hardware unit to the end customer. Once a unit is sold to a customer, the customer enters into a service agreement directly with the Company. The obligation to supply the service and the credit risk rests with us. The subscription revenue is recognized when the service is rendered.\nWe also sell hardware to motor vehicle dealerships for fitment into their vehicle trading stock. These dealerships purchase the hardware from us and are considered to act as a principal in the contract because they obtain title to the hardware, bear the risks and rewards of ownership and accordingly control the hardware purchased. The buyer of the vehicle then enters into a service-only contract with us. Revenue is recognized upon sale of the hardware to the dealership and subscription revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the customer.\nWe distribute devices and other hardware to enterprise fleet customers through dealers. Dealers are considered to act as a principal for the sale of hardware to the end customer, and revenue is recognized by us upon sale of the hardware unit to\nthe dealer. Dealers are also considered to act as a principal for the provision of the service to end customers because, even though the dealers do not provide the service themselves, the dealers control the right to receive the service before that right is transferred to the end customer, the dealers have the primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide the service to the end customer, and the dealers have full discretion in establishing the prices charged to the end customer. Accordingly, subscription revenue is recognized as the service is provided to the dealers.\nDeferred commissions\nCommissions incurred to acquire contracts are capitalized and amortized, unless the amortization period is 12 months or less. The commission capitalized is attributed to the specific performance obligations in the related contract. Commission is considered commensurate with respect to a particular contract when equivalent/comparable commission is payable upon the extension or renewal of such a contract or upon the customer entering into a new contract. To the extent commission capitalized is commensurate, the commission attributable to service will be amortized over the minimum contractual period or, if shorter, the expected life of the contract. To the extent it is not commensurate, the commission capitalized that is attributable to service is amortized over the expected life of the contract. Typically, with regard to month-to-month contracts, commission payable is not considered commensurate for such contracts because no commission is payable as and when the customer extends each month by not giving notice. Accordingly, commission incurred on such contracts that is attributable to service is amortized over the expected life of the contract taking account of expected extensions/renewals.\nRecurring commission is commission which is payable for each month the customer remains with us. The amount capitalized reflects the total commission payable over the minimum contractual period or, if shorter, the expected life of the contract, together with the effect of the time value of money, where significant.\nAmortization expense of external commissions capitalized is recognized in cost of sales, while that of internal commissions is recognized in sales and marketing costs. Commissions not capitalized under the 12-month practical expedient are also classified in the same manner.\nPrior to the adoption of ASC 606, commissions incurred to acquire contracts were recognized as expenses as incurred.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivables is calculated by considering all relevant information, internal and external about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to appropriately reflect the risk of losses over the remaining contractual life of an asset. Historical loss rates, calculated as actual losses over a period as a percentage of revenue, are adjusted for current conditions and management's expectations about future economic conditions.\nThe allowance is measured on a collective basis where management groups their customers appropriately based on their credit risk characteristics.\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is a valuation account and the asset's carrying amount is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Actual write-downs are recorded when the asset is deemed uncollectible after all efforts to recover have yielded no results.\nWe have adopted ASC 326 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses ( ASC 326\u201d) effective April 1, 2019. Prior to this date the allowance for doubtful accounts was determined on an incurred-loss basis.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for possible impairment at least annually, or when circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Goodwill is allocated to a reporting unit for the purpose of impairment testing. No impairments of goodwill existed as of the last testing date, March 31, 2020 or the previous testing, March 31, 2019. The changes in the carrying value of goodwill during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 are attributable only to foreign currency translation adjustments.\nAlthough there were no impairments of goodwill as of March 31, 2020, significant judgement was exercised in determining the fair value of each reporting unit, especially in light of COVID-19, which has had and, we believe, will continue to have an adverse impact on global economies and financial markets. In particular, to the extent that anticipated new contracts do not materialize and the business strategy does not come to fruition, or key personnel are not retained, the forecasts on which the impairment tests were performed could be negatively impacted.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nIntangible assets that are not ready for use are not subject to amortization but are assessed annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired.\nLong-lived assets that are subject to amortization or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nAn asset is written down immediately to its fair value if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its future undiscounted cash flows. Recognized impairment losses are not reversed.\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.\nIntangible Assets\nInternal-use software and technology\nJudgements and estimates occur in the calculation and capitalization of internal-use software and technology. We capitalize as intangible assets, internal-use software acquired or developed solely to meet our internal needs. Costs, excluding general and administrative costs, are capitalized from the date on which management implicitly or explicitly authorizes, or commits to fund, the project, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will perform the intended function (application development stage). All costs incurred during the preliminary development stage are expensed. Capitalization ceases when the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended use.\nCosts, including annual licenses, associated with maintaining computer software programs, and training costs are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred for upgrades and enhancements (modifications to existing internal-use software that provides additional functionality) are capitalized during the application development stage.\nSoftware capitalized is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life ranging from 1 to 18 years, commencing on the date when the software is ready for its intended use. Judgements and estimates are used in the determination of these useful lives.\nComputer Software for External Use\nJudgements and estimates occur in the calculation and capitalization of computer software for external use. Computer software for external use refers to the firmware that is developed for the devices and other hardware provided us to our customers. The costs of developing firmware are expensed as incurred prior to the establishment of its technological feasibility, from which point the development costs are capitalized and recognized as intangible assets. For the periods presented, technological feasibility could only be demonstrated shortly before the release of the firmware, and as a result, the development costs that meet the requirements for capitalization are not material.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\nThe cost of in-vehicle devices installed in vehicles (including installation and shipping costs) as well as the cost of uninstalled in-vehicle devices, is capitalized as property and equipment. We depreciate installed in-vehicle devices on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, commencing upon installation, whereas uninstalled in-vehicle devices are not depreciated until installed. The related depreciation expense is recorded as part of cost of revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nDepreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to reduce their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives.\nThe assets' useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.\nRight-of-use assets are included in property and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nTaxation\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. Where applicable tax legislation is subject to interpretation, management makes assessments, based on expert tax advice, of the relevant tax that is more likely than not to be paid and provides accordingly.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Income tax expense is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. The Company uses the portfolio approach for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income.\nThe current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws and tax rates enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Interest, and penalties, incurred on the underpayment of income taxes is classified as interest expense, and administration expenses, respectively.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax is measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Uncertainty generated by the current economic environment may affect the valuation of our deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax balances and associated valuation allowances represent management's best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimate.\nManagement periodically evaluates its tax positions with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. For uncertainties in income tax positions if it is more likely than not that some tax benefit will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position, then the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more likely than not that some tax benefit will be sustained, then zero tax benefit is recognized. As of March 31, 2018 and 2019, there was an uncertain tax position in respect of certain tax deductions, related to tax years prior to 2017, that were disallowed. No tax benefit was recognized because it was not considered more likely than not that the tax benefit would be realized. After a lengthy legal process, approval for the tax deductions was received in January 2020, resulting in the recognition of a current tax asset of $0.5 million. There were no material uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2020.\nDeferred tax liabilities arising on investments in domestic subsidiaries are not recognized to the extent that the investment can be recovered on a tax-free basis; and on investments in foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the undistributed earnings will be invested indefinitely or will be remitted in a tax-free liquidation.\nQuarterly results of operations\nThe table below sets out our quarterly results for each of the eight quarters in the period ending March 31, 2020.\n\nSubscription revenue historically has been our largest and fastest growing component of total revenue. Subscription revenue growth is primarily due to increases in the number of total subscribers in each quarter.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe do not engage in any off-balance sheet financing activities. We do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities, which include special purpose entities and other structured finance entities which are not consolidated.\nTabular
