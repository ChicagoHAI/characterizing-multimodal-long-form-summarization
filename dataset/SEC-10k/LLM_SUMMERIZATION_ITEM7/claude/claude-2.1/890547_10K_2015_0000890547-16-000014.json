Perelman.\nThe Company's vision is to establish Revlon as the quintessential and most innovative beauty company in the world by offering products that make consumers feel attractive and beautiful. We want to inspire our consumers to express themselves boldly and confidently. The Company operates in three segments: the consumer division ( Consumer\u201d); the professional division ( Professional\u201d); and Other (as described below). The Company manufactures, markets and sells an extensive array of beauty and personal care products worldwide, including color cosmetics, hair color, hair care and hair treatments, beauty tools, men's grooming products, anti-perspirant deodorants, fragrances, skincare and other beauty care products.\nFor additional information regarding our business, see \"Part 1, Item 1 - Business\" in this Form 10-K.\nDiscontinued Operations Presentation\nAs a result of the Company's decision on December 30, 2013 to exit its direct manufacturing, warehousing and sales business operations in mainland China, effective December 31, 2013, the Company is reporting the results of its former China operations within income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. Unless otherwise stated, financial results discussed within \"Overview\" and \"Results of Operations\" refer only to continuing operations. See Note 4, \"Discontinued Operations\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nOverview of Net Sales and Earnings Results\nConsolidated net sales in 2015 were $1,914.3 million, a decrease of $26.7 million, or 1.4%, compared to $1,941.0 million in 2014. Excluding the $121.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, consolidated net sales increased $94.5 million, or 4.9%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by an increase in Consumer segment net sales of $53.9 million, or 3.7%, and the inclusion of $28.4 million of net sales as a result of the CBB Acquisition.\nConsolidated income from continuing operations, net of taxes, in 2015 was $65.3 million, compared to consolidated income from continuing operations, net of taxes, of $46.0 million in 2014. The $19.3 million increase in 2015 was primarily due to:\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $26.4 million decrease in the provision for income taxes in 2015, primarily due to the favorable impact as a result of the net reduction of the Company's deferred tax valuation allowance on the Company's net deferred tax assets for certain foreign jurisdictions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$10.5 million in restructuring charges and other, net, in 2015, which primarily includes $9.5 million in restructuring charges recognized in 2015 related to the 2015 Efficiency Program, as compared to $21.3 million of restructuring charges and other, net recognized in 2014, primarily due to the Integration Program;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$9.3 million of favorable variance in foreign currency (gains) losses, net, as a result of $15.7 million in foreign currency losses, net, recognized during 2015, compared to $25.0 million in foreign currency losses, net, recognized during 2014; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $6.2 million reduction in SG&A expenses, primarily driven by the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which was partially offset by higher brand support within both the Consumer and Professional segments and increases in general and administrative expenses primarily due to $10.2 million of the 2015 pension lump sum settlement charge that was recorded as a component of SG&A expenses, as well as higher severance costs and incentive compensation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table> with the foregoing partially offset by:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$26.2 million of lower gross profit in 2015 primarily due to a $26.7 million decrease in consolidated net sales, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the unfavorable impact of a $10.5 million portion of the 2015 pension lump sum settlement charge in 2015 recorded within cost of sales; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $9.7 million non-cash impairment loss on goodwill for the Company's Global Color Brands reporting unit.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> These items are discussed in more detail within \"Results of Operations\" and within \"Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below.\nRecent Events\n2015 Efficiency Program\nIn September 2015, the Company initiated the 2015 Efficiency Program, consisting of restructuring actions to drive certain organizational efficiencies across the Company's Consumer and Professional segments. These actions are designed to reduce general and administrative expenses within the Consumer and Professional segments, and the Company expects that they will be completed by the end of 2017. The Company recognized $9.5 million of restructuring and related charges in 2015 for the 2015 Efficiency Program, of which $6.0 million related to the Consumer segment and $3.2 million related to the Professional segment, with the remaining charges included within unallocated corporate expenses, and expects to recognize total restructuring and related charges of $10.1 million by the end of 2017. By implementing the 2015 Efficiency Program, the Company expects to achieve annualized cost reductions of approximately $10.0 million to $15.0 million by the end of 2018, with approximately $3.0 million of cost reductions included in 2015 results.\nIn connection with the restructuring actions initiated in 2015 for the 2015 Efficiency Program, the Company expects to pay cash in an amount of approximately $10.3 million, including $0.2 million for capital expenditures (which capital expenditures are excluded from total restructuring and related charges expected to be recognized for the 2015 Efficiency Program), of which $2.8 million was paid in 2015, $5.8 million is expected to be paid in 2016, and the remaining balance is expected to be paid in 2017.\nSee Note 3, \"Restructuring Charges,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details.\nAcquisition of CBBeauty Group\nOn the CBB Acquisition Date, the Company completed the CBB Acquisition for total cash consideration of $48.6 million. CBB develops, manufactures, markets and distributes fragrances and other beauty products under various celebrity, lifestyle and fashion brands licensed from third parties, principally through department stores and selective distribution in international territories. CBB is expected to provide the Company with a platform to develop the Company's presence in the fragrance category. On the CBB Acquisition Date, the Company used cash on hand to pay 70% of the total cash consideration, or $34.6 million. The remaining $14.0 million of the total cash consideration is payable in equal installments over four years from the CBB Acquisition Date, subject to the selling shareholders' compliance with certain service conditions. These remaining installments are being recorded as a component of SG&A expenses ratably over the four year installment period. The results of operations of the CBB business were included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements commencing on the CBB Acquisition Date. See Note 2, \"Business Combinations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details on the CBB Acquisition.\nPension Lump Sum Settlement Charge\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company offered certain former employees who had vested benefits in the Company's U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (the Revlon Employees' Retirement Plan) the option of receiving the present value of the participant's pension benefit in a one-time cash lump sum payment. Based on the participants' acceptance of that offer, $53.4\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nmillion was paid from the plan's assets to settle $66.9 million of pension liabilities, resulting in a $13.5 million net reduction of the Company's pension plan liabilities in 2015. In addition, the Company recorded a charge of $20.7 million as a result of the pension lump sum settlement accounting within costs of sales and SG&A expense in 2015. This charge was the result of accelerating a portion of the losses that were deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which are required to be recognized in the period in which the pension plan liabilities were settled. See Note 14, \"Savings Plan, Pension and Post-retirement Benefits,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details on this pension lump sum settlement.\nNon-cash Impairment Charge\nFor purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company's Pure Ice nail enamel brand, which was acquired in July 2012, is included within the Company's Global Color Brands reporting unit. Despite improvements in the net sales of Pure Ice nail enamel in 2015 and the realization of margin improvements through integrating the production of Pure Ice nail enamel within the Company's existing manufacturing processes, the Company continued to experience declines in the promotional activity for the Pure Ice brand at retailers. As a result, in conjunction with the Company's annual goodwill impairment test, the Company recorded a $9.7 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge during the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the Company's expectations regarding the future performance of the Global Color Brands reporting unit in relation to its carrying amount. See Note 8, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details on this non-cash goodwill impairment charge.\n2015 Debt Related Transaction\nIn March 2015, Products Corporation prepaid $24.6 million of term loan indebtedness, representing 50% of its 2014 \"excess cash flow\" in accordance with the terms of its Amended Term Loan Agreement. The prepayment was applied on a ratable basis between the principal amounts outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan and the Acquisition Term Loan. The amount of the prepayment that was applied to the 2011 Term Loan reduced the principal amount outstanding by $12.1 million to $662.9 million (as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan had been paid). The $12.5 million applied to the Acquisition Term Loan reduced Products Corporation's future regularly scheduled quarterly amortization payments under the Acquisition Term Loan on a ratable basis from $1.8 million prior to the prepayment to $1.7 million after giving effect to the prepayment and through its maturity on October 8, 2019. See Note 11, \"Long-Term Debt,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details.\nOperating Segments\nThe Company primarily operates in three segments: the Consumer segment, the Professional segment and the Other segment:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Consumer segment is comprised of the Company's consumer brands, which primarily include Revlon, Almay, SinfulColors and Pure Ice in color cosmetics; Revlon ColorSilk in women's hair color; Revlon in beauty tools; and Mitchum in anti-perspirant deodorants. The Company's principal customers for its consumer products include large volume retailers, chain drug and food stores, chemist shops, hypermarkets, general merchandise stores, the Internet/e-commerce, television shopping, department stores, one-stop shopping beauty retailers, specialty cosmetics stores and perfumeries in the U.S. and internationally. The Consumer segment also includes a skincare line and a hair color line sold to large volume retailers and other retailers, primarily in Spain.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Professional segment is comprised primarily of the Company's professional brands, which include Revlon Professional in hair color and hair care; CND-branded products in nail polishes and nail enhancements; and American Crew in men's grooming products, all of which are sold worldwide to professional salons. The Company's principal customers for its professional products include hair and nail salons and distributors to professional salons in the U.S. and internationally. The Professional segment also includes a multi-cultural hair care line consisting of Creme of Nature hair care products sold to professional salons, large volume retailers and other retailers, primarily in the U.S.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Other segment primarily includes the operating results of the CBB business and related purchase accounting for the CBB Acquisition. CBB develops, manufactures, markets and distributes fragrances and other beauty products under various celebrity, lifestyle and fashion brands licensed from third parties, principally through department stores and selective distribution in international territories. The results included within the Other segment are not material to the Company's consolidated results of operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nResults of Operations\nIn the tables below, all amounts are in millions and numbers in parentheses ( ) denote unfavorable variances.\nConsolidated Net Sales:\nConsolidated net sales in 2015 were $1,914.3 million, a decrease of $26.7 million, or 1.4%, compared to $1,941.0 million in 2014. Excluding the $121.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, consolidated net sales increased $94.5 million, or 4.9%, during 2015, primarily driven by an increase in Consumer segment net sales of $53.9 million, or 3.7%, and the inclusion of $28.4 million of net sales as a result of the CBB Acquisition.\nConsolidated net sales in 2014 were $1,941.0 million, an increase of $446.3 million, or 29.9% as compared to $1,494.7 million in 2013. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations of $60.1 million, consolidated net sales increased $506.4 million, or 33.9% during 2014, primarily driven by the increase in net sales of $460.9 million as a result of the Colomer Acquisition in October 2013.\nSee \"Segment Results\" below for further discussion.\nSegment Results:\nThe Company's management evaluates segment profit, which is defined as income from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gains/losses on foreign currency fluctuations, gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt and miscellaneous expenses, for each of the Company's reportable segments. Segment profit also excludes unallocated corporate expenses and the impact of certain items that are not directly attributable to the segments' underlying operating performance, which includes the impact of: (i) restructuring and related charges; (ii) acquisition and integration costs; (iii) goodwill impairment charges; (iv) pension lump sum settlement charge; (v) costs of sales resulting from fair value adjustments to inventory acquired in acquisitions; (vi) deferred compensation related to the CBB Acquisition; (vii) insurance proceeds received in 2013 related to the 2011 fire that destroyed the Company's facility in Venezuela; and (viii) an accrual for estimated clean-up costs related to the Company's facility in Venezuela. Unallocated corporate expenses primarily include general and administrative expenses related to the corporate organization. These expenses are recorded in unallocated corporate expenses as these items are centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company removed pension-related costs for its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans from the measurement of its operating segment results. As a result, $8.2 million and $4.9 million of pension-related costs were reclassified from the measurement of Consumer segment profit and included as a component of unallocated corporate expenses for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company does not have any material inter-segment sales. For a reconciliation of segment profit to income from continuing operations before income taxes, see Note 18, \"Segment Data and Related Information\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe following tables provide a comparative summary of the Company's segment results for each of 2015, 2014 and 2013. In the tables below, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. Consumer segment net sales and segment profit include the results of retail brands acquired in the Colomer Acquisition, which had previously been included in the Professional segment.\nTable 117:

Excluding the $77.4 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations (referred to herein as on an \"XFX basis\"), total Consumer net sales increased $53.9 million, or 3.7%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products, Revlon ColorSilk hair color and Cutex nail products, partially offset by lower net sales of Almay color cosmetics. Consumer segment net sales were negatively impacted in connection with the Company's exit of its business operations in Venezuela in the second quarter of 2015 and change to a distributor model, as such change resulted in $1.0 million of net sales in Venezuela in 2015, compared to $16.3 million of net sales in Venezuela in 2014. Excluding Venezuela, on an XFX basis, Consumer net sales would have increased by 4.4% in 2015, compared to 2014.\nConsumer segment profit in 2015 was $360.2 million, an increase of $20.8 million, or 6.1%, compared to $339.4 million in 2014. Excluding the $9.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, Consumer segment profit increased $30.0 million, or 8.8%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher gross profit as a result of the increases in net sales discussed above, partially offset by $8.7 million of higher brand support expenses for the Company's Consumer brands. In connection with the Company's exit of its business operations in Venezuela in the second quarter of 2015 and change to a distributor model, there was no profit in Venezuela in 2015, compared to $6.6 million of profit in Venezuela in 2014. Excluding Venezuela, on an XFX basis, Consumer segment profit would have increased by 11.1% in 2015, compared to 2014.\nConsumer segment net sales in 2014 were $1,438.3 million, an increase of $44.1 million, or 3.2%, compared to $1,394.2 million in 2013. Excluding the $54.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, total Consumer net sales increased $98.3 million, or 7.1%, in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily driven by: (i) the inclusion of $52.8 million of increased net sales from Consumer brands acquired in the Colomer Acquisition; (ii) $15.1 million of favorable sales returns reserve adjustments in the U.S. during 2014, as a result of lower expected discontinued products in the future related to the Company's strategy to focus on fewer, bigger and better innovations, partially offset by increased sales returns expense for 2014 sales returns; and (iii) higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, Revlon ColorSilk hair color and Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products. The increases in Consumer segment net sales in 2014 were partially offset by lower net sales of fragrances, as well as lower net sales of Almay, SinfulColors and Pure Ice color cosmetics.\nConsumer segment profit in 2014 was $339.4 million, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 0.8%, compared to $342.3 million in 2013, primarily due to lower gross profit as a result of $33.0 million of higher advertising expense to support the Company's Consumer brands, and approximately $17.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by the increase in net sales, including the $15.1 million of favorable sales returns reserve adjustments.\nProfessional Segment\nProfessional segment net sales in 2015 were $471.1 million, a decrease of $31.6 million, or 6.3%, compared to $502.7 million in 2014. Excluding the $43.8 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, total Professional net sales increased $12.2 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of higher net sales of American Crew men's grooming products, Revlon Professional hair products and Creme of Nature hair products, partially offset by lower net sales of CND nail products in the U.S.\nProfessional segment profit in 2015 was $103.9 million, a decrease of $0.9 million, or 0.9%, compared to $104.8 million in 2014. Excluding the $3.7 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, Professional segment profit increased $2.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to higher net sales, partially offset by $5.1 million of higher brand support\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nexpenses for the Company's Professional brands. In addition, Professional segment profit in 2014 included a favorable adjustment of $3.4 million related to the inventory obsolescence reserve, with no similar adjustment in 2015.\nThe Company's Professional segment is comprised of most of the operations acquired by the Company in the Colomer Acquisition in October 2013 (with the exception of the retail brands acquired in the Colomer Acquisition, which the Company has included within the Consumer segment, as noted above). As Colomer was acquired in October 2013, there are no full year comparable prior years' net sales or segment profit for the Professional segment to facilitate a comparison of 2014 and 2013 Professional segment results. Therefore, an analysis of net sales and segment profit for the Professional segment in 2014, compared to 2013, is not included in this Form 10-K. Professional net sales were $502.7 million for the full year of 2014 and $100.5 million from the October 2013 Colomer Acquisition Date through the end of 2013. Professional net sales during each period consisted primarily of the net sales of CND products worldwide, including CND Shellac; Revlon Professional products, primarily in Europe; and American Crew products and other professional brands world-wide.\nProfessional segment profit was $104.8 million for the full year of 2014 and $5.1 million from the October 2013 Colomer Acquisition Date through the end of 2013 and is comprised of the operating results of substantially all of the operations acquired in the Colomer Acquisition.\nGeographic Results:\nIn connection with changes that the organization made to its management reporting structure following the Colomer Acquisition, beginning in 2014, the Company combined its former Latin America and Canada; Asia Pacific; and Europe, Middle East and Africa operating regions into the International region for reporting purposes. The Company has modified its net sales discussion to conform to the manner by which the Company's management reviews the business, and, accordingly, prior year amounts have been restated to conform to this presentation.\nThe following tables provide a comparative summary of the Company's net sales by region for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>XFX Change (a)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,043.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,021.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>870.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>919.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total Net Sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,914.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,941.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>XFX Change (a)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,021.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>832.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>919.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>661.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>257.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>317.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total Net Sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,941.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,494.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>446.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>506.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) XFX excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nUnited States\nIn the U.S., net sales in 2015 increased $21.8 million, or 2.1%, to $1,043.7 million, compared to $1,021.9 million in 2014, primarily due to higher Consumer segment net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products and Revlon ColorSilk hair color, partially offset by lower net sales of Almay color cosmetics. Net sales in the U.S. decreased in the Professional segment primarily due to lower net sales of CND nail products.\nIn the U.S., net sales in 2014 increased $189.1 million, or 22.7%, to $1,021.9 million, as compared to $832.8 million in 2013, primarily due to the inclusion of $157.1 million of increased net sales as a result of the Colomer Acquisition. 2014 net sales in the U.S. were also impacted by $15.1 million of favorable sales returns reserve adjustments during 2014, as a result of lower expected discontinued products in the future related to the Company's strategy to focus on fewer, bigger and better innovations, partially offset by increased sales returns expense for 2014 sales returns. In addition, 2014 had higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, Revlon ColorSilk hair color and Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products, partially offset by lower net sales of Almay, SinfulColors and Pure Ice color cosmetics.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nInternational\nInternational net sales in 2015 decreased by $48.5 million, or 5.3%, to $870.6 million, as compared to $919.1 million in 2014. Excluding the $121.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, International net sales increased by $72.7 million, or 7.9%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics in the Consumer segment. International net sales increased in the Professional segment primarily due to higher net sales of American Crew men's grooming products and Revlon Professional hair products. From a geographic perspective, the increase in international net sales was throughout most of the Company's International region. The Company's exit of its business operations in Venezuela in 2015 negatively impacted International net sales. Excluding Venezuela, on an XFX basis, International net sales would have increased by 9.0% in 2015, compared to 2014.\nInternational net sales in 2014 increased $257.2 million, or 38.9%, to $919.1 million, as compared to $661.9 million in 2013. Excluding the $60.1 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, International net sales increased by $317.3 million, or 47.9%, primarily due to the inclusion of $303.8 million of increased net sales as a result of the Colomer Acquisition. Additionally, 2014 net sales were impacted by higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics in Venezuela and Japan and Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products primarily in the U.K., partially offset by lower net sales of Revlon color cosmetics in certain distributor markets and fragrances in the U.K. and Italy. Results in Venezuela for 2014 benefited from the increased availability of U.S. Dollars to import finished goods for sale, as compared to 2013.\nGross profit:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,246.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,272.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>949.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>323.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales\n</td> <td>65.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit decreased as a percentage of net sales by 0.5 percentage points, decreasing by $26.2 million in 2015, as compared to 2014.

The lower average debt outstanding was the result of: (i) regularly scheduled quarterly amortization payments made towards the Acquisition Term Loan through December 31, 2015; (ii) the favorable benefit to 2015 as a result of the May 1, 2014 prepayment of the remaining $58.4 million principal amount outstanding under the Non-Contributed Loan; and (iii) the $24.6 million March 2015 excess cash flow prepayment, of which $12.1 million was applied to the principal amount outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan. The remaining $12.5 million of the excess cash flow prepayment that was applied to the Acquisition Term Loan reduced Products Corporation's future regularly scheduled quarterly amortization payments under the Acquisition Term Loan on a ratable basis from $1.8 million prior to such prepayment to $1.7 million after giving effect to such prepayment and through its maturity on October 8, 2019. The higher weighted average borrowing rates were primarily due to the impact of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap going into effect in May 2015.\nThe $5.8 million increase in interest expense in 2014, as compared to 2013, was primarily due to higher average debt as a result of Products Corporation's Acquisition Term Loan that was used to fund the Colomer Acquisition, partially offset by lower weighted average borrowing rates.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nForeign currency losses, net:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency losses, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in foreign currency losses, net, of $9.3 million during 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily driven by:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $6.0 million foreign currency loss recognized in 2014 as a result of the re-measurement of Revlon Venezuela's balance sheet, as compared to a $1.9 million foreign currency loss recognized in 2015;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $3.8 million gain in 2015, compared to a $0.5 million gain in 2014, related to the Company's foreign currency forward exchange contracts;

(ii) certain expenses related to the Colomer Acquisition; (iii) the favorable resolution of tax matters in a foreign jurisdiction; (iv) increased pre-tax income; and (v) establishing a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets in the Professional segment in 2014 (each of which in the case of (i), (ii) and (iii) favorably affected the provision for income taxes in 2013 and each of which did not recur in 2014), partially offset by the favorable impact of certain discrete items in 2014, including the favorable resolution of tax matters in certain jurisdictions and return-to-provision adjustments.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for 2015 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35% due principally to: (i) foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to operations outside the U.S.; (ii) state and local taxes; and (iii) foreign dividends and earnings taxable in the U.S., partially offset by the net reduction of valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for 2014 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35% due principally to: (i) state and local taxes, net of U.S federal income tax benefit; (ii) establishing a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets in the Professional segment; (iii) foreign dividends and earnings taxable in the U.S.; and (iv) foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to operations outside the U.S.\nThe Company expects that its tax provision and effective tax rate in any individual quarter and year-to-date period will vary and may not be indicative of the Company's tax provision and effective tax rate for the full year.\nIn assessing the recoverability of its deferred tax assets, management regularly considers whether some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized based on the recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is generally dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\ntaxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. See Note 16, Income Taxes,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had a liquidity position of $473.6 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents (net of any outstanding checks) of $307.4 million, as well as $166.2 million in available borrowings under Products Corporation's $175.0 million Amended Revolving Credit Facility, based upon the borrowing base less $8.8 million of undrawn outstanding letters of credit and no other borrowing outstanding under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility at such date.\nThe Company's foreign operations held $97.3 million out of the total $307.4 million in cash and cash equivalents (net of any outstanding checks) as of December 31, 2015. The cash held by the Company's foreign operations is primarily used to fund such operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources of cash to fund these needs. As part of this assessment, the Company determines the amount of foreign earnings, if any, that it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs, including for the Company's debt service obligations, and pays applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes, if any, on such earnings to the extent repatriated, and otherwise records a tax liability for the estimated cost of repatriation in a future period. The Company believes that the cash generated by its domestic operations and availability under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility and other permitted lines of credit should be sufficient to meet its domestic liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. Therefore, the Company currently anticipates that restrictions and/or taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings will not have a material effect on the Company's liquidity during such period.\nChanges in Cash Flows\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $326.9 million, compared with $275.3 million at December 31, 2014.

The decrease in cash from operating activities in 2015, compared to the 2014, was primarily driven by higher inventory and tax payments, partially offset by less cash used in discontinued operations, as well as lower payments for restructuring and interest in 2015 compared to 2014. The cash provided by operating activities in 2014, compared to 2013, was favorably impacted by cash provided by the operations of the Professional segment, as a result of the Colomer Acquisition, partially offset by higher interest payments and unfavorable changes in working capital, including higher tax payments and higher payments for restructuring actions primarily related to both the Integration Program and the restructuring actions that included exiting the Company's direct manufacturing, warehousing and sales business operations in mainland China, as well as implementing other immaterial restructuring actions outside the U.S. that are expected to generate other operating efficiencies (the \"December 2013 Program\").\nSee Note 3, \"Restructuring Charges\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion related to the Company's restructuring programs.\nNet cash provided by operating activities related to discontinued operations, including restructuring payments, was approximately $0.1 million, $27 million and $10 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $83.8 million, $52.1 million and $639.4 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2015 included:\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$48.3 million of cash used for capital expenditures;

The prepayment was applied on a ratable basis between the principal amounts outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan and the Acquisition Term Loan. The amount of the prepayment applied to the 2011 Term Loan reduced the principal amount outstanding by $12.1 million to $662.9 million (as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan had been paid). The $12.5 million applied to the Acquisition Term Loan reduced Products Corporation's future regularly scheduled quarterly amortization payments under the Acquisition Term Loan on a ratable basis from $1.8 million prior to the prepayment to $1.7 million after giving effect to the prepayment and through its maturity on October 8, 2019.\n2014 Debt Related Transactions\nFebruary 2014 Term Loan Amendment\nIn February 2014, Products Corporation entered into an amendment (the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment\u201d) to its Amended Term Loan Agreement among Products Corporation, as borrower, a syndicate of lenders and Citicorp USA, Inc. ( CUSA\u201d), as administrative agent and collateral agent.\nPursuant to the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment, the interest rates applicable to Eurodollar Loans under the 2011 Term Loan bear interest at the Eurodollar Rate plus 2.5% per annum, with the Eurodollar Rate not to be less than 0.75% (compared to 3.0% and 1.0%, respectively, prior to the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment), while Alternate Base Rate Loans under the 2011 Term Loan bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus 1.5%, with the Alternate Base Rate not to be less than 1.75% (compared to 2.0% in each case prior to the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment) (and as each such term is defined in the Amended Term Loan Agreement).\nProducts Corporation's Acquisition Term Loan and Amended Revolving Credit Facility were not amended in connection with the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment.\nDuring 2014, the Company incurred approximately $1.1 million of fees and expenses in connection with the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment, which were expensed as incurred, and wrote-off $0.8 million of unamortized debt discount and deferred financing costs as a result of the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment. These amounts, totaling $1.9 million, were recognized within loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRepayment of Non-Contributed Loan\nOn May 1, 2014, Products Corporation used available cash on hand to optionally prepay in full the remaining $58.4 million principal amount then outstanding under the non-contributed loan portion of the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan Agreement (the \"Non-Contributed Loan\") that remained owing from Products Corporation to various third parties. The Non-Contributed Loan would have otherwise matured on October 8, 2014. In connection with such prepayment, the Company wrote-off $0.1 million of deferred financing costs, which were recognized within loss on early extinguishment of debt in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for 2014.\n2013 Debt Transactions\nTerm Loan and Revolving Credit Facility Amendments\n(i) February 2013 Term Loan Amendments\nIn February 2013, Products Corporation consummated amendments (the \"February 2013 Term Loan Amendments\") to its third amended and restated term loan agreement dated as of May 19, 2011 (as amended, the \"2011 Term Loan Agreement,\" or the 2011 Term Loan Facility\u201d or the \"2011 Term Loan\") among Products Corporation, as borrower, a syndicate of lenders and CUSA, as administrative agent and collateral agent.\nPursuant to the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments, Products Corporation reduced the total aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan at such time from $788.0 million to $675.0 million, using a portion of the proceeds from Products Corporation's issuance of its 5\u00be% Senior Notes (see 2013 Senior Notes Refinancing\u201d below), together with cash on hand. The February 2013 Term Loan Amendments also reduced the interest rates on the 2011 Term Loan such that (prior to giving effect to the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment) Eurodollar Loans bore interest at the Eurodollar Rate plus 3.00% per annum, with the Eurodollar Rate not to be less than 1.00% (compared to 3.50% and 1.25%, respectively, prior to the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments), while Alternate Base Rate Loans bore interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus 2.00%, with the Alternate Base Rate not to be less than 2.00% (compared to 2.50% and 2.25%, respectively, prior to the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments) (and as each such term is defined in the 2011 Term Loan Agreement).\nPursuant to the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments, Products Corporation, under certain circumstances, also has the right to request the 2011 Term Loan to be increased by up to the greater of: (i) $300 million; and (ii) an amount such that Products Corporation's First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2011 Term Loan Agreement) does not exceed 3.50:1.00 (compared to $300 million prior to the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments). The lenders are not committed to provide any such increase. Any such increase would be in addition to the Acquisition Term Loan.\n(ii) August 2013 Term Loan Amendments\nIn August 2013, in connection with the Colomer Acquisition, Products Corporation consummated further amendments (the \"August 2013 Term Loan Amendments\") to its 2011 Term Loan Agreement (as amended by the August 2013 Term Loan Amendments and the Incremental Amendment, the \"Amended Term Loan Agreement\" or the \"Amended Term Loan Facility\"), which permitted, among other things: (i) Products Corporation's consummation of the Colomer Acquisition; and (ii) Products Corporation's incurring up to $700 million of term loans which it used as a source of funds to consummate the Colomer Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses.\n(iii) Incremental Amendment\nIn August 2013, in connection with the Colomer Acquisition, Products Corporation entered into an incremental amendment (the \"Incremental Amendment\") resulting in the Amended Term Loan Agreement with Citibank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch (collectively, the \"Initial Acquisition Lenders\") and CUSA, as administrative agent and collateral agent, pursuant to which the Initial Acquisition Lenders committed to provide up to $700 million of term loans under the Amended Term Loan Agreement (the \"Acquisition Term Loan\"). The Acquisition Term Loan was issued on October 8, 2013 and Products Corporation used the net proceeds of $698.3 million as a source of funds to consummate the Colomer Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses.\n(iv) Amended Revolving Credit Facility\nIn August 2013, in connection with the Colomer Acquisition, Products Corporation consummated an amendment (the \"August 2013 Revolver Amendment\") to its third amended and restated revolving credit agreement dated June 16, 2011 (the \"2011 Revolving Credit Agreement\") which amended its then $140.0 million asset-backed, multi-currency revolving credit facility (the \"2011 Revolving Credit Facility\") to permit, among other things: (a) Products Corporation's consummation of the Colomer Acquisition; and (b) Products Corporation's incurring up to $700 million of the Acquisition Term Loan that Products Corporation used as a source of funds to consummate the Colomer Acquisition. Additionally, the August 2013 Revolver Amendment (1) reduced Products Corporation's interest rate spread over the LIBOR rate applicable to Eurodollar Loans under the facility from a range, based on availability, of 2.00% to 2.50%, to a range of 1.50% to 2.00%; (2) reduced the commitment fee on unused availability under the facility from 0.375% to 0.25%; and (3) extended the maturity of the facility, which was previously scheduled to mature in June 2016, to the earlier of (i) August 2018 or (ii) the date that is 90 days prior to the earliest maturity date of any term loans then outstanding under Products Corporation's bank term loan agreements, but not earlier than June 2016.\nAdditionally, in December 2013, Products Corporation entered into an incremental amendment (the \"December 2013 Revolver Amendment\" and together with the August 2013 Revolver Amendment, the \"2013 Revolver Amendments\") to its 2011 Revolving Credit Agreement (as amended by the 2013 Revolver Amendments, the \"Amended Revolving Credit Agreement\" and the \"Amended Revolving Credit Facility\"). Under the terms of the December 2013 Revolver Amendment, the lenders' commitment to provide borrowings to Products Corporation and its subsidiary borrowers under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility was increased from $140.0 million to $175.0 million.\n2013 Senior Notes Refinancing\nIn February 2013, Products Corporation issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5\u00be% Senior Notes due February 15, 2021 (the 5\u00be% Senior Notes\u201d) to investors at par. Products Corporation used $491.2 million of the net proceeds (net of underwriters' fees) from the issuance of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes to repay and redeem all of the $330.0 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its 9\u00be% Senior Secured Notes that were otherwise due November 2015 (the 9\u00be% Senior Secured Notes\"), as well as to pay an aggregate of $28.0 million for the applicable redemption and tender offer premiums, accrued interest and related fees and expenses. Products Corporation used a portion of the remaining proceeds, together with existing cash, to pay approximately $113.0 million of principal on its 2011 Term Loan in conjunction with the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments. Products Corporation used the remaining balance available from the issuance of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, debt reduction transactions, including the repayment of the Contributed Loan (as hereinafter defined) as described below.\nRepayment of the Contributed Loan\nOn October 8, 2013, Products Corporation paid to Revlon, Inc. at maturity the remaining $48.6 million portion of the principal amount then due under the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan Agreement (the \"Contributed Loan\"), which Revlon, Inc. used to pay the liquidation preference of Revlon, Inc.'s Series A Preferred Stock in connection with its mandatory redemption of such stock on such date.\n(b) Summary of Terms and Covenants\nAmended Credit Agreements\nThe following is a summary description of the Amended Term Loan Facility, which includes the 2011 Term Loan and the Acquisition Term Loan, and the Amended Revolving Credit Facility. Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms have the meanings given to them in the Amended Term Loan Agreement and/or the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement (the \"Amended Credit Agreements\"), as applicable. Investors should refer to the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement and/or the Amended Term Loan Agreement for complete terms and conditions, as these summary descriptions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions.\nAmended Term Loan Facility\nAs of December 31, 2015, term loans under the Amended Term Loan Facility bear interest at the following interest rates:\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Eurodollar Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Alternate Base Rate Loans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2011 Term Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Eurodollar Rate plus 2.50% per annum (with the Eurodollar Rate not to be less than 0.75%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Alternate Base Rate plus 1.50% (with the Alternate Base Rate not to be less than 1.75%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition Term Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Eurodollar Rate plus 3.00% per annum (with the Eurodollar Rate not to be less than 1.00%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Alternate Base Rate plus 2.00% (with the Alternate Base Rate not to be less than 2.00%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe term loans under the Amended Term Loan Facility are required to be prepaid with:\n(i) the net cash proceeds in excess of $10 million for each 12-month period ending on March 31 received during such period from sales of Term Loan First Lien Collateral by Products Corporation or any of its subsidiary guarantors with carryover of unused annual basket amounts up to a maximum of $25 million and with respect to certain specified dispositions up to an additional $25 million in the aggregate (subject to a reinvestment right for 365 days, or 545 days if the Company has within such 365-day period entered into a legally binding commitment to invest such funds);\n(ii) the net proceeds from the issuance by Products Corporation or any of its subsidiaries of certain additional debt; and\n(iii) 50% of Products Corporation's annual excess cash flow\u201d (as defined under the Amended Term Loan Agreement), which payments commenced with respect to Products Corporation's excess cash flow for the 2014 fiscal year; such payments are required to be made within the first 100 days after the applicable year end.\nPursuant to the August 2013 Term Loan Amendments, the Amended Term Loan Facility contains a financial covenant limiting Products Corporation's first lien senior secured leverage ratio (the ratio of Products Corporation's senior secured debt that has a lien on the collateral which secures the Amended Term Loan Facility that is not junior or subordinated to the liens securing the Amended Term Loan Facility (excluding debt outstanding under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility) to EBITDA, as each such term is defined in the Amended Term Loan Facility), to no more than 4.25 to 1.0 for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending during the period from June 30, 2011 to the maturity date of the Amended Term Loan Facility.\nProducts Corporation, under certain circumstances, also has the right to request the Amended Term Loan Facility to be increased by up to the greater of (i) $300 million and (ii) an amount such that Products Corporation's First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Term Loan Agreement) does not exceed 3.50:1.00 (compared to $300 million prior to the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments). The lenders are not committed to provide any such increase. Any such increase would be in addition to the Acquisition Term Loan that was issued in October 2013 and used as a source of funds to consummate the Colomer Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses.\nThe 2011 Term Loan outstanding under the Amended Term Loan Facility matures on November 19, 2017. The Acquisition Term Loan under the Amended Term Loan Facility has the same terms as the 2011 Term Loan, except that: (i) it matures on the sixth anniversary of the closing of the Acquisition Term Loan (or October 8, 2019); and (ii) it amortizes on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year, in an amount equal to 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of such Acquisition Term Loan.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Products Corporation is required to prepay, on or before 100 days following the last day of its fiscal year (i.e., by April 9, 2016), $23.2 million of indebtedness under the Amended Term Loan Facility, representing 50% of its 2015 \"excess cash flow\" (as defined under the Amended Term Loan Agreement). The prepayment will be applied on a ratable basis between the principal amounts outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan and the Acquisition Term Loan. The amount of the prepayment to be applied to the 2011 Term Loan will be used to reduce the aggregate principal amount outstanding (as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan have been paid), while the amount to be applied to the Acquisition Term Loan will be used to reduce Products Corporation's future annual amortization payments (which are payable in equal quarterly installments) on a ratable basis from $6.9 million prior to the prepayment to $6.8 million after giving effect to the prepayment and through its maturity on October 8, 2019.\nAmended Revolving Credit Facility\nAvailability under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility varies based on a borrowing base that is determined by the value of eligible trade receivables and eligible inventory in the U.S. and the U.K. and eligible real property and equipment in the U.S. from time to time.\nIn January 2014, the Colomer U.S. Subsidiaries became additional guarantors under Products Corporation's Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility and the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture. In January and May 2015, the New U.S. Subsidiaries became additional guarantors under such debt instruments. In connection with becoming guarantors, substantially all of the assets of such subsidiaries were pledged as collateral under Products Corporation's Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility, thereby increasing the value of the assets supporting the borrowing base under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility.\nIf the value of the eligible assets is not sufficient to support the $175.0 million borrowing base under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, Products Corporation will not have full access to the Amended Revolving Credit Facility. Products Corporation's ability to borrow under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility is also conditioned upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent and Products Corporation's compliance with other covenants in the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement.\nIn each case subject to borrowing base availability, the Amended Revolving Credit Facility is available to:\n(i) Products Corporation in revolving credit loans denominated in U.S. Dollars;\n(ii) Products Corporation in swing line loans denominated in U.S. Dollars up to $30.0 million;\n(iii) Products Corporation in standby and commercial letters of credit denominated in U.S. Dollars and other currencies up to $60.0 million; and\n(iv) Products Corporation and certain of its international subsidiaries designated from time to time in revolving credit loans and bankers' acceptances denominated in U.S. Dollars and other currencies.\nAs a result of the August 2013 Revolver Amendment, under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, borrowings (other than loans in foreign currencies) bear interest, if made as Eurodollar Loans, at the Eurodollar Rate plus the applicable margin set forth in the grid below and, if made as Alternate Base Rate Loans, at the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin set forth in the grid below.\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excess Availability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Alternate Base Rate Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Eurodollar Loans, Eurocurrency Loan or Local Rate Loans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than or equal to $92,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.50%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less than $92,000,000 but greater than or equal to $46,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.75%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.75%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less than $46,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.00%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLocal Loans (as defined in the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement) bear interest, if mutually acceptable to Products Corporation and the relevant foreign lenders, at the Local Rate, and otherwise (i) if in foreign currencies or in U.S. Dollars at the Eurodollar Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate plus the applicable margin set forth in the grid above or (ii) if in U.S. Dollars at the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin set forth in the grid above.\nPrior to the termination date of the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, revolving loans are required to be prepaid (without any permanent reduction in commitment) with:\n(i) the net cash proceeds from sales of Revolving Credit First Lien Collateral by Products Corporation or any of Products Corporation's subsidiary guarantors (other than dispositions in the ordinary course of business and certain other exceptions); and\n(ii) the net proceeds from the issuance by Products Corporation or any of its subsidiaries of certain additional debt, to the extent there remains any such proceeds after satisfying Products Corporation's repayment obligations under the Amended Term Loan Facility.\nAs a result of the August 2013 Revolver Amendment, Products Corporation pays to the lenders under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility a commitment fee of 0.25% of the average daily unused portion of the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, which fee is payable quarterly in arrears. Under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, Products Corporation also pays:\n(i) to foreign lenders a fronting fee of 0.25% per annum on the aggregate principal amount of specified Local Loans (which fee is retained by foreign lenders out of the portion of the Applicable Margin payable to such foreign lender);\n(ii) to foreign lenders an administrative fee of 0.25% per annum on the aggregate principal amount of specified Local Loans;\n(iii) to the multi-currency lenders a letter of credit commission equal to the product of (a) the Applicable Margin for revolving credit loans that are Eurodollar Rate loans (adjusted for the term that the letter of credit is outstanding) and (b) the aggregate undrawn face amount of letters of credit; and\n(iv) to the issuing lender, a letter of credit fronting fee of 0.25% per annum of the aggregate undrawn face amount of letters of credit, which fee is a portion of the Applicable Margin.\nAs a result of the August 2013 Revolver Amendment, under certain circumstances, Products Corporation has the right to request that the Amended Revolving Credit Facility be increased by up to $100.0 million. The lenders are not committed to provide any such increase.\nUnder certain circumstances, if and when the difference between (i) the borrowing base under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) the amounts outstanding under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility is less than $20.0 million for a period of two consecutive days or more, and until such difference is equal to or greater than $20.0 million for a period of 30 consecutive business days, the Amended Revolving Credit Facility requires Products Corporation to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (the ratio of EBITDA minus Capital Expenditures to Cash Interest Expense for such period) of a minimum of 1.0 to 1.0.\nThe Amended Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of August 14, 2018 and the date that is 90 days prior to the earliest maturity date of any term loans then outstanding under the Amended Term Loan Facility, but not earlier than June 16, 2016.\nCovenants and Defaults Applicable to the Amended Term Loan Facility and the Amended Revolving Credit Facility\nThe Amended Credit Agreements contain various restrictive covenants prohibiting Products Corporation and its subsidiaries from:\n(i) incurring additional indebtedness or guarantees, with certain exceptions;\n(ii) making dividend and other payments or loans to Revlon, Inc. or other affiliates, with certain exceptions, including among others:\n(a) exceptions permitting Products Corporation to pay dividends or make other payments to Revlon, Inc. to enable it to, among other things, pay expenses incidental to being a public holding company, including, among other things, professional fees such as legal, accounting and insurance fees, regulatory fees, such as SEC filing fees and NYSE listing fees, and other expenses related to being a public holding company;\n(b) subject to certain circumstances, to finance the purchase by Revlon, Inc. of its Class A Common Stock in connection with the delivery of such Class A Common Stock to grantees under the Fourth Amended and Restated Revlon, Inc. Stock Plan and/or the payment of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards under such plan;\n(c) subject to certain limitations, to pay dividends or make other payments to finance the purchase, redemption or other retirement for value by Revlon, Inc. of stock or other equity interests or equivalents in Revlon, Inc. held by any current or former director, employee or consultant in his or her capacity as such; and\n(d) subject to certain limitations, to make other restricted payments to Products Corporation's affiliates in an amount up to $10 million per year (plus $10 million for each calendar year commencing with 2011), other restricted payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $35 million and certain other restricted payments, including without limitation those based upon certain financial tests;\n(iii) creating liens or other encumbrances on Products Corporation's or its subsidiaries' assets or revenues, granting negative pledges or selling or transferring any of Products Corporation's or its subsidiaries' assets, all subject to certain limited exceptions;\n(iv) with certain exceptions, engaging in merger or acquisition transactions;\n(v) prepaying indebtedness and modifying the terms of certain indebtedness and specified material contractual obligations, subject to certain exceptions;\n(vi) making investments, subject to certain exceptions; and\n(vii) entering into transactions with Products Corporation's affiliates involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $10 million other than upon terms that are not materially less favorable when taken as a whole to Products Corporation or its subsidiaries as terms that would be obtainable at the time for a comparable transaction or series of similar transactions in arm's length dealings with an unrelated third person and where such payments or consideration exceed $20 million, unless such transaction has been approved by all of Products Corporation's independent directors, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe events of default under each of the Amended Term Loan Agreement and the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement include customary events of default for such types of agreements. For a description of the events of defaults, see Note 11, \"Long-Term Debt\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. If Products Corporation is in default under the senior secured leverage ratio under the Amended Term Loan Facility or the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio under the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement, Products Corporation may cure such default by issuing certain equity securities to, or receiving capital contributions from, Revlon, Inc. and applying such cash which is deemed to increase EBITDA for the purpose of calculating the applicable ratio. Products Corporation may exercise this cure right two times in any four-quarter period.\nProducts Corporation was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Amended Term Loan Agreement and the Amended Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, the aggregate principal amounts outstanding under the Acquisition Term Loan and the 2011 Term Loan were $673.7 million and $662.9 million, respectively, and availability under the $175.0 million Amended Revolving Credit Facility, based upon the calculated borrowing base less $8.8 million of outstanding undrawn letters of credit and nil then drawn on the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, was $166.2 million. There were no borrowings under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility during 2015.\n5\u00be% Senior Notes\nIn February 2013, Products Corporation completed its offering (the \"2013 Senior Notes Refinancing\"), pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the \"Securities Act\"), of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes. The 5\u00be% Senior Notes are unsecured and were issued under the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture to investors at par. The 5\u00be% Senior Notes mature on February 15, 2021. Interest on the 5\u00be% Senior Notes accrues at 5\u00be% per annum, paid every six months on February 15th and August 15th. The 5\u00be% Senior Notes were issued pursuant to the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture, dated as of February 8, 2013 (the Notes Closing Date\u201d), by and among Products Corporation, Products Corporation's domestic subsidiaries (the Guarantors\u201d), which also currently guarantee Products Corporation's Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Guarantors issued guarantees (the Guarantees\u201d) of Products Corporation's obligations under the 5\u00be% Senior Notes and the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture on a joint and several, senior unsecured basis. The Colomer U.S. Subsidiaries became additional guarantors in January 2014 and the New U.S. Subsidiaries became additional guarantors in January and May 2015, in each case under Products Corporation's Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility and the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture.\nIn December 2013, Products Corporation consummated an offer to exchange the original 5\u00be% Senior Notes for $500 million of new 5\u00be% Senior Notes, which have substantially the same terms as the original 5\u00be% Senior Notes, except that they are registered under the Securities Act (such registered new notes being the 5\u00be% Senior Notes\u201d).\nProducts Corporation used a portion of the $491.2 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes (net of underwriters' fees) to repay and redeem all of the $330.0 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its 9\u00be% Senior Secured Notes, as well as to pay $8.6 million of accrued interest. Products Corporation incurred an aggregate of $19.4 million of fees for the applicable redemption and tender offer premiums, related fees and expenses in connection with redemption and repayment of the 9\u00be% Senior Secured Notes and other fees and expenses in connection with the issuance of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes. Products Corporation used a portion of the remaining proceeds from the issuance of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes, together with existing cash, to pay approximately $113.0 million of principal on its 2011 Term Loan in conjunction with the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments. Products Corporation used the remaining balance available from the issuance of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, debt reduction transactions, such as repaying to Revlon, Inc. at maturity on October 8, 2013 the Contributed Loan, which Revlon, Inc. used to pay the liquidation preference of Revlon, Inc.'s then outstanding Series A Preferred Stock in connection with its mandatory redemption on such date.\nRanking\nThe 5\u00be% Senior Notes are Products Corporation's unsubordinated, unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated obligations of Products Corporation and rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior debt of Products Corporation. Similarly, each Guarantee is the relevant Guarantor's joint and several, unsubordinated and unsecured obligation and ranks senior in right of payment to any future subordinated obligations of such Guarantor and ranks pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior debt of such Guarantor. The Guarantees were issued on a joint and several basis.\nThe 5\u00be% Senior Notes and the Guarantees rank effectively junior to Products Corporation's Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility, which are secured, as well as indebtedness and preferred stock of Products Corporation's foreign and immaterial subsidiaries (the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries\u201d), none of which guarantee the 5\u00be% Senior Notes.\nOptional Redemption\nOn and after February 15, 2016, the 5\u00be% Senior Notes may be redeemed at Products Corporation's option, at any time as a whole, or from time to time in part, at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount), plus accrued interest to the date of redemption, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on February 15th of the years indicated below:\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.313\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.875\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101.438\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019 and thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.000\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProducts Corporation may redeem the 5\u00be% Senior Notes at its option at any time or from time to time prior to February 15, 2016, as a whole or in part, at a redemption price per 5\u00be% Senior Note equal to the sum of: (1) the then outstanding principal amount thereof; plus (2) accrued and unpaid interest (if any) to the date of redemption; and plus (3) the applicable premium based on the applicable treasury rate plus 75 basis points.\nPrior to February 15, 2016, Products Corporation may, from time to time, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes and any additional notes with, and to the extent Products Corporation actually receives, the net proceeds of one or more equity offerings from time to time, at 105.75%of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption.\nChange of Control\nUpon the occurrence of specified change of control events, Products Corporation is required to make an offer to purchase all of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the outstanding principal amount of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes as of the date of any such repurchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.\nCertain Covenants\nThe 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture limits Products Corporation's and the Guarantors' ability, and the ability of certain other subsidiaries, to:\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>incur or guarantee additional indebtedness ( Limitation on Debt\u201d);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>pay dividends, make repayments on indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the 5\u00be% Senior Notes and make other restricted payments\u201d ( Limitation on Restricted Payments\u201d);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make certain investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>create liens on their assets to secure debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>enter into transactions with affiliates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>merge, consolidate or amalgamate with another company ( Successor Company\u201d);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>transfer and sell assets ( Limitation on Asset Sales\u201d); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>permit restrictions on the payment of dividends by Products Corporation's subsidiaries ( Limitation on Dividends from Subsidiaries\u201d).\n</td> </tr>\n</table> These covenants are subject to important qualifications and exceptions. The 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture also contains customary affirmative covenants and events of default.\nIn addition, if during any period of time the 5\u00be% Senior Notes receive investment grade ratings from both Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture, Products Corporation and its subsidiaries will not be subject to the covenants on Limitation on Debt, Limitation on Restricted Payments, Limitation on Asset Sales, Limitation on Dividends from Subsidiaries and certain provisions of the Successor Company covenant.\nCovenants\nProducts Corporation was in compliance with all applicable covenants under its 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nSpanish Government Loan\nIn connection with the Colomer Acquisition, the Company acquired the Colomer Group's euro-denominated loan payable to the Spanish government (the \"Spanish Government Loan\"), which loan had $0.6 million aggregate principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2015 (based on foreign exchange rates in effect as of such date). The Spanish Government Loan does not bear interest and is payable in 10 equal installments on June 30th of each year beginning in 2016 through 2025.\nImpact of Foreign Currency Translation - Venezuela\nRevlon Venezuela's net sales are de minimis, representing approximately 1% of the Company's consolidated net sales for each 2015, 2014 and 2013. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, Revlon Venezuela's assets represented approximately 1% of the Company's total assets, respectively.\nVenezuela - Highly-Inflationary Economy: Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. As a result, beginning January 1, 2010, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency for the Company's subsidiary in Venezuela ( Revlon Venezuela\u201d). As Venezuela is designated as highly inflationary, foreign currency translation adjustments of Revlon Venezuela's balance sheet have been reflected in the Company's earnings.\nVenezuela - Currency Restrictions: Foreign currency restrictions enacted by the Venezuelan government since 2003 have become more restrictive and have impacted Revlon Venezuela's ability to obtain U.S. Dollars in exchange for Venezuelan Bolivars (\"Bolivars\") at the official foreign exchange rates from the Venezuelan government and its foreign exchange commission, the Comisi\u00f3n de Administracion de Divisas ( CADIVI\u201d). In May 2010, the Venezuelan government took control over the previously freely-traded foreign currency exchange market and, in June 2010, replaced it with a new foreign currency exchange system, the Sistema de Transacciones en Moneda Extranjera ( SITME\u201d). In the second quarter of 2011, the Company began using a SITME rate of 5.5 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar (the \"SITME Rate\") to translate Revlon Venezuela's financial statements, as this was the rate at which the Company accessed U.S. Dollars in the SITME market during this period. Through December 31, 2012, the Company continued using the SITME Rate to translate Revlon Venezuela's financial statements.\nVenezuela - 2013 Foreign Currency Devaluation: In February 2013, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of Bolivars relative to the U.S. Dollar, changing the official exchange rate to 6.3 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar (the \"Official Rate\"). The Venezuelan government also announced that the SITME foreign currency market administered by Venezuela's central bank would be eliminated, and as a result, the Company began using the Official Rate to translate Revlon Venezuela's financial statements beginning in 2013. To reflect the impact of the foreign currency devaluation, the Company recorded a one-time foreign currency loss of $0.6 million in earnings in the first quarter of 2013 as a result of the required re-measurement of Revlon Venezuela's monetary assets and liabilities.\nVenezuela - 2014 Foreign Currency Devaluation: In January 2014, the Venezuela government announced that the CADIVI would be replaced by the government-operated National Center of Foreign Commerce (the \"CENCOEX\"), and indicated that the Sistema Complementario de Administraci\u00f3n de Divisas ( SICAD\u201d) market would continue to be offered as an alternative foreign currency exchange. Additionally, a parallel foreign currency exchange system, SICAD II, started functioning in March 2014 and allowed companies to apply for the purchase of foreign currency and foreign currency denominated securities for any legal use or purpose. Throughout 2014, the Company exchanged Bolivars for U.S. Dollars to the extent permitted through the various foreign currency markets available based on its ability to participate in those markets. Prior to June 30, 2014, the Company utilized the Official Rate and following a consideration of the Company's specific facts and circumstances, which included its legal ability and intent to participate in the SICAD II exchange market to import finished goods into Venezuela, the Company determined that it was appropriate to utilize the SICAD II rate of 53 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar (the \"SICAD II Rate\") to translate Revlon Venezuela's financial statements beginning on June 30, 2014. As a result, the Company recorded a foreign currency loss of $6.0 million in the second quarter of 2014 related to the required re-measurement of Revlon Venezuela's monetary assets and liabilities. For 2014, the change to the SICAD II Rate of 53 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar, as compared to the Official Rate of 6.3 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar, had the impact of reducing the Company's consolidated net sales by $16.2 million and reducing the Company's consolidated operating income by $8.4 million.\nVenezuela - 2015 Foreign Currency Devaluation: In February 2015, the Venezuela government introduced a new foreign currency exchange platform, the Marginal Currency System (\"SIMADI\"), which created a third new mechanism to exchange Bolivars for U.S. Dollars through private brokers. SIMADI replaced the SICAD II system and started operating on February 12, 2015. As a result, the Company considered its specific facts and circumstances in order to determine the appropriate rate of exchange to translate Revlon Venezuela's financial statements. Through December 31, 2015, the Company has not participated in the SIMADI exchange market; however, given the elimination of the SICAD II system, the Company determined that it was appropriate to use the SIMADI rate of 193 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar (the \"SIMADI Rate\") to translate Revlon Venezuela's balance sheet beginning on March 31, 2015.\nAs a result of the change from the SICAD II Rate to the SIMADI Rate on March 31, 2015, the Company was required to re-measure all of Revlon Venezuela's monetary assets and liabilities at the SIMADI Rate. Using the SIMADI Rate, the Company recorded a foreign currency loss of $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2015 as a result of the required re-measurement of Revlon Venezuela's balance sheet. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company exited its business operations in Venezuela and changed to a distributor model. Current or additional governmental restrictions, worsening import authorization controls, price and profit controls or labor unrest in Venezuela could impact the Company's ability to sell to the distributor in Venezuela.\nSources and Uses\nThe Company's principal sources of funds are expected to be operating revenues, cash on hand and funds available for borrowing under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility and other permitted lines of credit. The Amended Credit Agreements, and the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture contain certain provisions that by their terms limit Products Corporation and its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur additional debt.\nThe Company's principal uses of funds are expected to be the payment of operating expenses, including expenses in connection with the continued execution of the Company's business strategy; purchases of permanent wall displays; capital expenditure requirements; debt service payments and costs; cash tax payments; pension and other post-retirement benefit plan contributions; payments in connection with the Company's restructuring programs; business and/or brand acquisitions (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), if any; severance not otherwise included in the Company's restructuring programs; debt and/or equity repurchases, if any; costs related to litigation; and payments in connection with discontinuing non-core business lines and/or exiting certain territories. The Company's cash contributions to its pension and post-retirement benefit plans in 2015 were $18.1 million. The Company expects cash contributions to its pension and post-retirement benefit plans to be approximately $20 million in the aggregate for 2016. The Company's cash taxes paid in 2015 were $25.2 million. The Company expects to pay cash taxes of approximately $55 million in the aggregate for 2016. The Company's purchases of permanent wall displays and capital expenditures in 2015 were $47.4 million and $48.3 million, respectively. The Company expects purchases of permanent wall displays and capital expenditures to be approximately $50.0 million and $55.0 million, respectively, in the aggregate for 2016. See also Note 2, \"Business Combinations,\" for discussion regarding the utilization of funds related to the Company's April 2015 CBB Acquisition.\nThe Company has undertaken, and continues to assess, refine and implement, a number of programs to efficiently manage its working capital, including, among other things, initiatives intended to optimize inventory levels over time; centralized procurement to secure discounts and efficiencies; prudent management of trade receivables and accounts payable; and controls on general and administrative spending. In the ordinary course of business, the Company's source or use of cash from operating activities may vary on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of working capital flows.\nContinuing to execute the Company's business strategy could include taking advantage of additional opportunities to reposition, repackage or reformulate one or more brands or product lines, launching additional new products, acquiring businesses or brands (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), divesting or discontinuing non-core business lines (which may include exiting certain territories), further refining the Company's approach to retail merchandising and/or taking further actions to optimize its manufacturing, sourcing and organizational size and structure, including optimizing the Colomer Acquisition and CBB Acquisition. Any of these actions, the intended purpose of which would be to create value through improving the Company's financial performance, could result in the Company making investments and/or recognizing charges related to executing against such opportunities. Any such activities may be funded with cash on hand, funds available under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility and/or other permitted additional sources of capital, which actions could increase the Company's total debt.\nThe Company may also, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt obligations and/or equity in open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise and may seek to refinance some or all of its indebtedness based upon market conditions. Any retirement or purchase of debt and/or equity may be funded with operating cash flows of the business or other sources and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may be material.\nThe Company expects that operating revenues, cash on hand and funds available for borrowing under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility and other permitted lines of credit will be sufficient to enable the Company to pay its operating expenses for 2016, including expenses in connection with the execution of the Company's business strategy, purchases of permanent wall displays, capital expenditure requirements, debt service payments and costs, cash tax payments, pension and other post-retirement plan contributions, payments in connection with the Company's restructuring programs, business and/or brand acquisitions (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), if any, severance not otherwise included in the Company's restructuring programs, debt and/or equity repurchases, if any, costs related to litigation and/or discontinuing non-core business lines and/or exiting certain territories.\nThere can be no assurance that available funds will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements on a consolidated basis. If the Company's anticipated level of revenues is not achieved because of, among other things, decreased consumer spending in response to weak economic conditions or weakness in the consumption of beauty care products in one or more of the Consumer, Professional and/or Other segments; adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency controls and/or government-mandated pricing controls; decreased sales of the Company's products as a result of increased competitive activities by the Company's competitors and/or decreased performance by third party suppliers; changes in consumer purchasing habits, including with respect to retailer preferences and/or among professional salons; inventory management by the Company's customers; space reconfigurations or reductions in display space by the Company's customers; changes in pricing, marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies by the Company's customers; or less than anticipated results from the Company's existing or new products or from its advertising, promotional, pricing and/or marketing plans; or if the Company's expenses, including, without limitation, for restructuring costs, acquisition and integration costs , costs related to litigation, advertising, promotional and marketing activities or for sales returns related to any reduction of space by the Company's customers, product discontinuances or otherwise, exceed the anticipated level of expenses, the Company's current sources of funds may be insufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements.\nAny such developments, if significant, could reduce the Company's revenues and operating income and could adversely affect Products Corporation's ability to comply with certain financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreements and in such event the Company could be required to take measures, including, among other things, reducing discretionary spending. (See Item 1A. \"Risk Factors - The Company's ability to service its debt and meet its cash requirements depends on many factors, including achieving anticipated levels of revenue and expenses. If such revenue or expense levels prove to be other than as anticipated, the Company may be unable to meet its cash requirements or Products Corporation may be unable to meet the requirements of the financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations\" and certain other risk factors discussing certain risks associated with the company's business and indebtedness).\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nForeign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts\nProducts Corporation enters into FX Contracts and option contracts from time to time to hedge certain net cash flows denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of the Company's foreign and domestic operations. The FX Contracts are entered into primarily for the purpose of hedging anticipated inventory purchases and certain intercompany payments denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of the Company's foreign and domestic operations and generally have maturities of less than one year. At December 31, 2015, the FX Contracts outstanding had a notional amount of $76.3 million and a net asset fair value of $1.4 million.\nInterest Rate Swap Transaction\nIn November 2013, Products Corporation executed a forward-starting floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction with a 1.00% floor, based on a notional amount of $400 million in respect of indebtedness under the Acquisition Term Loan over a period of three years (the \"2013 Interest Rate Swap\"). The Company designated the 2013 Interest Rate Swap as a cash flow hedge of the variability of the forecasted three-month LIBOR interest rate payments related to the $400 million notional amount under Products Corporation's Acquisition Term Loan over the three-year term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap. Commencing in May 2015, Products Corporation receives from the counterparty a floating interest rate based on the higher of three-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR or 1.00%, while paying a fixed interest rate payment to the counterparty equal to 2.0709% (which effectively fixes the interest rate on such notional amount at 5.0709% over the three-year term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap). For the year ended December 31, 2015, the 2013 Interest Rate Swap was deemed effective and therefore the changes in fair value related to the 2013 Interest Rate Swap have been recorded in Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair value of the Company's 2013 Interest Rate Swap at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was a liability of $6.5 million and $3.5 million, respectively.\nCredit Risk\nExposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of the derivative instruments in asset positions, which totaled $2.0 million and $0.2 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The Company attempts to minimize exposure to credit risk by generally entering into derivative contracts with counterparties that have investment-grade credit ratings and are major financial institutions. The Company also periodically monitors any changes in the credit ratings of its counterparties. Given the current credit standing of the counterparties to the Company's derivative instruments, the Company believes the risk of loss arising from any non-performance by any of the counterparties under these derivative instruments is remote.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nDisclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table aggregates all contractual obligations and commercial commitments that affect the Company's financial condition and liquidity position as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n(dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, including current portion (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,833.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>662.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>640.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>306.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term obligations (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,442.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>283.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>851.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>738.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>569.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Consists primarily of (i) the $662.9 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan as of December 31, 2015;

Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Company's most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts:\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical experience and ongoing evaluations of the Company's receivables and evaluations of the risks of payment. The allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against trade receivable balances when they are deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of trade receivables previously reserved are recorded in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss) when received.\nSales Returns:\nThe Company allows customers, primarily within its Consumer segment, to return their unsold products when they meet certain company-established criteria as outlined in the Company's trade terms. The Company regularly reviews and revises, when deemed necessary, the Company's estimates of sales returns based primarily upon historical product returns experience, planned product discontinuances and promotional sales, which would permit customers to return products based upon the Company's trade terms. The Company records estimated sales returns as a reduction to sales and cost of sales, and an increase in accrued liabilities and inventories.\nReturned products, which are recorded as inventories, are valued based upon the amount that the Company expects to realize upon their subsequent disposition. The physical condition and marketability of the returned products are the major factors the Company considers in estimating realizable value. Cost of sales includes the cost of refurbishment of returned products. Actual returns, as well as realized values on returned products, may differ significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the Company's estimates if factors such as product discontinuances, customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company's estimates and expectations and, in the case of actual product returns, if economic conditions differ significantly from the Company's estimates and expectations.\nTrade Support Costs:\nIn order to support the retail trade, the Company has various performance-based arrangements with retailers to reimburse them for all or a portion of their promotional activities related to the Company's products. The Company regularly reviews and revises, when deemed necessary, estimates of costs to the Company for these promotions based on estimates of what has been incurred by the retailers. Actual costs incurred by the Company may differ significantly if factors such as the level and success of the retailers' programs, as well as retailer participation levels, differ from the Company's estimates and expectations.\nInventories:\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is based on standard cost and production variances, which approximates actual cost on the first-in, first-out method. Cost components include direct materials, direct labor and direct overhead, as well as in-bound freight. The Company records adjustments to the value of inventory based upon its forecasted plans to sell its inventories, as well as planned discontinuances. The physical condition (e.g., age and quality) of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation. These adjustments are estimates, which could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the amounts that the Company may ultimately realize upon the disposition of inventories if future economic conditions, customer inventory levels, product discontinuances, sales return levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company's estimates and expectations.\nPension Benefits:\nThe Company sponsors both funded and unfunded pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering employees who meet the applicable eligibility requirements. The Company uses several statistical and other factors in an attempt to estimate future events in calculating the liability and net periodic benefit income/cost related to these plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected long-term return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined annually by the Company, within certain guidelines, which assumptions would be subject to revisions if significant events occur during the year. The Company uses December 31st as its measurement date for defined benefit pension plan obligations and plan assets.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company adopted an alternative approach to calculating the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other post-retirement benefits, the full yield curve\u201d approach. Under this method, the discount rate assumption was built through the application of specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for each of the Company's pension and other retirement plans. Prior to December 31, 2015, the Company estimated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. This change does not affect the measurement of the Company's total benefit obligations, as the change in service and interest costs is exactly offset in the actuarial loss (gain) recognized for each year. The Company made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. The change has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle, and accordingly, has been accounted for prospectively.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nThe Company utilized a 4.15% weighted average discount rate in 2015 for the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans, compared to a 3.89% weighted average discount rate in 2014. The Company utilized a 3.68% weighted average discount rate for the Company's international defined benefit pension plans in 2015, compared to a 3.74% weighted average discount rate selected in 2014. The discount rates are used to measure the benefit obligations at the measurement date and the net periodic benefit income/cost for the subsequent calendar year and are reset annually using data available at the measurement date. The changes in the discount rates used for 2015 were primarily due to observed increases in long-term interest yields on high-quality corporate bonds from 2014. At December 31, 2015, the increase in the discount rates from December 31, 2014 had the effect of decreasing the Company's projected pension benefit obligation by approximately $15 million.\nIn selecting its expected long-term rate of return on its plan assets, the Company considers a number of factors, including, without limitation, recent and historical performance of plan assets, the plan portfolios' asset allocations over a variety of time periods compared with third-party studies, the performance of the capital markets in recent years and other factors, as well as advice from various third parties, such as the plans' advisors, investment managers and actuaries. While the Company considered both the recent performance and the historical performance of plan assets, the Company's assumptions are based primarily on its estimates of long-term, prospective rates of return. The difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Those gains or losses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods. For the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the expected long-term rate of return on the pension plan assets used was 7.50% for 2015 and 7.75% for 2014. The weighted average expected long-term rate of return used for the Company's international plans was 6.00% for both 2015 and 2014. For 2015, the Company's pension plans assets realized a loss of $13.9 million, as compared with expected return on assets of $40.3 million. The resulting net deferred loss of $54.2 million, when combined with gains and losses from previous years, will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 10 to 30 years. The actual return on plan assets was below expectations, primarily due to lower returns in developed equity markets and bond yields.\nThe table below reflects the Company's estimates of the possible effects that changes in the discount rates and expected long-term rates of return would have had on its 2015 net periodic benefit costs and its projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2015 for the Company's principal defined benefit pension plans, with all other assumptions remaining constant:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25 basis points increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25 basis points decrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net periodic benefit costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Projected pension benefit obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net periodic benefit costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Projected pension benefit obligation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected long-term rate of return\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe rate of future compensation increases is another assumption used by the Company's third party actuarial consultants for pension accounting. The rate of future compensation increases used for the Company's projected pension benefit obligation in 2015 was 3.50%, as compared to 3.00% in 2014 for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Such increase was not applied to the Revlon Employees' Retirement Plan and the Revlon Pension Equalization Plan, as the rate of future compensation increases is no longer relevant to such plans due to plan amendments which effectively froze these plans as of December 31, 2009.\nIn addition, the Company's actuarial consultants also use other factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants, among other things. Differences from these assumptions could significantly impact the actual amount of net periodic benefit cost and liability recorded by the Company.\nTo determine the fiscal 2016 net periodic benefit income/cost, the Company is using the \"full yield curve approach\" described above to separately calculate discount rates for each of the service and interest components. The following table represents the weighted average discount rates used in calculating each component of service and interest costs for the Company's U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans:\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S.\nPlans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International\nPlans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest cost on projected benefit obligation\n</td> <td>3.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service cost\n</td> <td>4.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest cost on service cost\n</td> <td>4.32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nFor 2016, the Company is using long-term rates of return on pension plan assets of 7.00% and 6.00% for its U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans, respectively. The Company expects that the impact in 2016 of the change in calculating the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other post-retirement benefits following the adoption of the full yield curve approach as discussed above will result in net periodic benefit income of approximately $5.1 million for 2016. The Company expects that the impact of the changes in discount rates and the return on plan assets in 2016 will result in net periodic benefit expense of $3.4 million for 2016, compared to $1.9 million of net periodic benefit income in 2015.\nGoodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets:\nIn determining the fair values of net assets acquired, including trade names, customer relationships and other intangible assets, and resulting goodwill related to the Company's business acquisitions, the Company considers, among other factors, the analyses of historical financial performance and an estimate of the future performance of the acquired business. The fair values of the acquired intangible assets are primarily calculated using a discounted cash flow approach.\nDetermining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations. There are significant judgments inherent in a discounted cash flow approach, including, the selection of appropriate discount rates, hypothetical royalty rates, contributory asset capital charges, estimating the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and identification of appropriate terminal growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in discounted cash flow analyses are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the respective acquired intangible assets.\nDetermining an acquired intangible asset's useful life requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including the expected use of the asset, consumer awareness, trade name history and future expansion expectations, as well as any contractual provisions that could limit or extend an asset's useful life. The Company believes that an acquired trade name has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and the Company has the intent and ability to support the trade name with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If this indefinite-lived criteria is not met, acquired trade names are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from five to 20 years.\nGoodwill totaled $469.7 million and $464.1 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the goodwill of $210.1 million, $240.7 million and $18.9 million related to the Consumer, Professional and Other segments, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangibles totaled $95.0 million and $101.3 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but rather are reviewed annually for impairment using September 30th carrying values, or when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current carrying amounts may not be recovered. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to any such excess. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company establishes its reporting units based on its current reporting structure, product characteristics and management. Within the Consumer segment, the Company has identified two reporting units: (i) \"Global Color Brands,\" which include the SinfulColors and Pure Ice nail enamel brands; and (ii) \"Revlon, Almay and Other,\" which includes the remainder of the Company's Consumer brands and does not include brands of the Company's Other reportable segment. The Company's other reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 18, Segment Data and Related Information.\u201d For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to each reporting unit to the extent that goodwill relates to each reporting unit.\nFor 2015, the Company utilized the two-step process as prescribed by ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, in order to identify potential impairment for each of its reporting units. In the first step of this test, the Company compared the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units, determined based upon discounted estimated future cash flows, to the respective carrying amount, including goodwill. Where the fair value of such reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount, no further work was required and no impairment loss was recognized. The results of the step one test indicated that impairment indicators may have existed for the Company's Global Color Brands reporting unit as a result of the observed decline in sales of the Pure Ice nail enamel brand, primarily driven by the effects of declines in the promotional activity for the Pure Ice brand at retailers, and accordingly, the Company performed step two of the goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit.\nIn the second step, the Company measured the potential impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the Global Color Brands reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill at September 30, 2015. The implied fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination, where the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was allocated to all the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit (including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid. When the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of that reporting unit's goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized within operations. The Company determined the fair value of the Global Color Brands reporting unit using discounted estimated future cash flows. The weighted average cost of capital in testing the Global Color Brands reporting unit for impairment was 13.0% with a perpetual growth rate of 2.0%. As a result of this annual impairment test, the Company recognized a $9.7 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nthe Global Color Brands reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2015. Following the recognition of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge, the Global Color Brands reporting unit has remaining goodwill in the amount of $25.6 million at December 31, 2015.\nAs of the date of the latest impairment test, the fair values of the (i) Revlon, Almay and Other; (ii) Professional; and (iii) Other reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately $2.5 billion, $310.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively. The Company did not record any impairment of identified intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFor 2014 and 2013, the Company performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it would be necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test and to assess the Company's indefinite lived intangible assets for indicators of impairment, and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying amounts. The Company did not record any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2013.\nSee Note 2, Business Combinations\u201d and Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net\u201d for further discussion of the Company's goodwill and intangible assets.\nIncome Taxes:\nThe Company records income taxes based on amounts payable with respect to the current year and includes the effect of deferred taxes. The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax-planning opportunities that may be available in various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, and the Company's estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Determining the Company's effective tax rate and evaluating tax positions requires significant judgment.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which management expects that the Company will recover or settle those differences. The realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on forecasted future taxable income. The Company has established valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize a tax benefit. Any reduction in estimated forecasted future taxable income may require the Company to record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance was not previously established. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Provision for income taxes,\u201d for further discussion.\nThe Company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the merits of such position. The Company recognizes liabilities for unrecognized tax positions in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts is ultimately not required, the reversal of the liabilities would result in additional tax benefits recognized in the period in which the Company determines that the liabilities are no longer required. If the estimate of tax liabilities is ultimately less than the final assessment, this will result in a further charge to expense. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.\nThe Company provides for U.S. federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on foreign subsidiaries' cumulative undistributed earnings when it is not the Company's intent to indefinitely reinvest such earnings overseas. No provision is made for U.S. income taxes where the Company's plan is to indefinitely reinvest such undistributed earnings from the Company's foreign operations in its overseas operations. If these future foreign earnings are repatriated to the U.S., or if the Company determines that such foreign earnings will be remitted to the U.S. in the foreseeable future, additional U.S. tax provisions may be required.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-08, \"Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity,\" which changes the requirements for reporting discontinued operations under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 205. Under ASU No. 2014-08, a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. The standard states that a strategic shift could include a disposal of: (i) a major geographical area of operations; (ii) a major line of business; (iii) a major equity method investment; or (iv) other major parts of an entity. ASU No. 2014-08 no longer precludes presentation as a discontinued operation if: (i) there are operations and cash flows of the component that have not been eliminated from the reporting entity's ongoing operations; or (ii) there is significant continuing involvement with a component after its disposal. Additional disclosures about discontinued operations will also be required. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and is to be applied prospectively to new disposals and new classifications of disposal groups as held for sale after the effective date. The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-08 on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2015, and such adoption did not have an impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or financial statement disclosures.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards or Updates Not Yet Effective\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,\" which requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent within a company's balance sheet. Currently, the Company is required to separate deferred income tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts on its classified balance sheet, and this update will simplify the presentation by requiring a single, noncurrent amount. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-17 beginning on January 1, 2016 and the adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, \"Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments,\" which eliminates the current requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-16 beginning on January 1, 2016 and the adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, \"Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,\" which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by requiring inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value, rather than at the lower of cost or market. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt ASU No. 2015-11 beginning on January 1, 2017. The Company is evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and financial statement disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, \"Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\" which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the financial statements as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied retrospectively. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03 beginning on January 1, 2016 and the adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in the ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The core principle of ASU No. 2014-09 is for companies to recognize revenue from the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 also will result in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provide guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively (for example, service revenue and contract modifications) and improve guidance for multiple-element arrangements. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption prohibited. The Company expects to adopt ASU No. 2014-09 beginning January 1, 2018 and is in the process of assessing the impact that the new guidance will have on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and financial statement disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, \"Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,\" that will explicitly require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures if conditions give rise to substantial doubt. According to ASU No. 2014-15, substantial doubt exists if it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations within one year after the issuance date. The likelihood threshold of \"probable,\" similar to its current use in U.S. GAAP for loss contingencies, will be used to define substantial doubt. Disclosures will be required under ASU No. 2014-15 if conditions give rise to substantial doubt including whether and how management's plans will alleviate the substantial doubt. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption prohibited. The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-15 beginning January 1, 2016 and the adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.\nInflation\nThe Company's costs are affected by inflation and the effects of inflation that the Company may experience in future periods.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A is presented as follows:\n \u2022 Overview; \n \u2022 Operating Segments; \n \u2022 Results of Operations; \n \u2022 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources; \n \u2022 Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments; \n \u2022 Off-Balance Sheet Transactions (there are none); \n \u2022 Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies; \n \u2022 Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements; \n \u2022 Recently Issued Accounting Standards or Updates Not Yet Effective; and \n \u2022 Inflation. \nThe Company (as defined below) is providing this overview in accordance with the SEC's December 2003 interpretive guidance regarding MD&A.\nOverview\nOverview of the Business\nRevlon Consumer Products Corporation (\"Products Corporation\" and together with its subsidiaries, the \"Company\") is a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of Revlon, Inc., which is an indirect majority-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated (together with certain of its affiliates other than Revlon, Inc. and the Company, \"MacAndrews & Forbes\"), a corporation wholly-owned by Ronald O. Perelman.\nThe Company's vision is to establish Revlon as the quintessential and most innovative beauty company in the world by offering products that make consumers feel attractive and beautiful. We want to inspire our consumers to express themselves boldly and confidently. The Company operates in three segments: the consumer division ( Consumer\u201d); the professional division ( Professional\u201d); and Other (as described below). The Company manufactures, markets and sells an extensive array of beauty and personal care products worldwide, including color cosmetics, hair color, hair care and hair treatments, beauty tools, men's grooming products, anti-perspirant deodorants, fragrances, skincare and other beauty care products.\nFor additional information regarding our business, see \"Part 1, Item 1 - Business\" in this Form 10-K.\nDiscontinued Operations Presentation\nAs a result of the Company's decision on December 30, 2013 to exit its direct manufacturing, warehousing and sales business operations in mainland China, effective December 31, 2013, the Company is reporting the results of its former China operations within income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. Unless otherwise stated, financial results discussed within \"Overview\" and \"Results of Operations\" refer only to continuing operations. See Note 4, \"Discontinued Operations\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nOverview of Net Sales and Earnings Results\nConsolidated net sales in 2015 were $1,914.3 million, a decrease of $26.7 million, or 1.4%, compared to $1,941.0 million in 2014. Excluding the $121.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, consolidated net sales increased $94.5 million, or 4.9%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by an increase in Consumer segment net sales of $53.9 million, or 3.7%, and the inclusion of $28.4 million of net sales as a result of the CBB Acquisition.\nConsolidated income from continuing operations, net of taxes, in 2015 was $65.3 million, compared to consolidated income from continuing operations, net of taxes, of $46.0 million in 2014. The $19.3 million increase in 2015 was primarily due to:\n \u2022 a $26.4 million decrease in the provision for income taxes in 2015, primarily due to the favorable impact as a result of the net reduction of the Company's deferred tax valuation allowance on the Company's net deferred tax assets for certain foreign jurisdictions; \nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\n \u2022 $10.5 million in restructuring charges and other, net, in 2015, which primarily includes $9.5 million in restructuring charges recognized in 2015 related to the 2015 Efficiency Program, as compared to $21.3 million of restructuring charges and other, net recognized in 2014, primarily due to the Integration Program; \n \u2022 $9.3 million of favorable variance in foreign currency (gains) losses, net, as a result of $15.7 million in foreign currency losses, net, recognized during 2015, compared to $25.0 million in foreign currency losses, net, recognized during 2014; and \n \u2022 a $6.2 million reduction in SG&A expenses, primarily driven by the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which was partially offset by higher brand support within both the Consumer and Professional segments and increases in general and administrative expenses primarily due to $10.2 million of the 2015 pension lump sum settlement charge that was recorded as a component of SG&A expenses, as well as higher severance costs and incentive compensation;  with the foregoing partially offset by:\n \u2022 $26.2 million of lower gross profit in 2015 primarily due to a $26.7 million decrease in consolidated net sales, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the unfavorable impact of a $10.5 million portion of the 2015 pension lump sum settlement charge in 2015 recorded within cost of sales; and \n \u2022 a $9.7 million non-cash impairment loss on goodwill for the Company's Global Color Brands reporting unit.  These items are discussed in more detail within \"Results of Operations\" and within \"Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below.\nRecent Events\n2015 Efficiency Program\nIn September 2015, the Company initiated the 2015 Efficiency Program, consisting of restructuring actions to drive certain organizational efficiencies across the Company's Consumer and Professional segments. These actions are designed to reduce general and administrative expenses within the Consumer and Professional segments, and the Company expects that they will be completed by the end of 2017. The Company recognized $9.5 million of restructuring and related charges in 2015 for the 2015 Efficiency Program, of which $6.0 million related to the Consumer segment and $3.2 million related to the Professional segment, with the remaining charges included within unallocated corporate expenses, and expects to recognize total restructuring and related charges of $10.1 million by the end of 2017. By implementing the 2015 Efficiency Program, the Company expects to achieve annualized cost reductions of approximately $10.0 million to $15.0 million by the end of 2018, with approximately $3.0 million of cost reductions included in 2015 results.\nIn connection with the restructuring actions initiated in 2015 for the 2015 Efficiency Program, the Company expects to pay cash in an amount of approximately $10.3 million, including $0.2 million for capital expenditures (which capital expenditures are excluded from total restructuring and related charges expected to be recognized for the 2015 Efficiency Program), of which $2.8 million was paid in 2015, $5.8 million is expected to be paid in 2016, and the remaining balance is expected to be paid in 2017.\nSee Note 3, \"Restructuring Charges,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details.\nAcquisition of CBBeauty Group\nOn the CBB Acquisition Date, the Company completed the CBB Acquisition for total cash consideration of $48.6 million. CBB develops, manufactures, markets and distributes fragrances and other beauty products under various celebrity, lifestyle and fashion brands licensed from third parties, principally through department stores and selective distribution in international territories. CBB is expected to provide the Company with a platform to develop the Company's presence in the fragrance category. On the CBB Acquisition Date, the Company used cash on hand to pay 70% of the total cash consideration, or $34.6 million. The remaining $14.0 million of the total cash consideration is payable in equal installments over four years from the CBB Acquisition Date, subject to the selling shareholders' compliance with certain service conditions. These remaining installments are being recorded as a component of SG&A expenses ratably over the four year installment period. The results of operations of the CBB business were included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements commencing on the CBB Acquisition Date. See Note 2, \"Business Combinations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details on the CBB Acquisition.\nPension Lump Sum Settlement Charge\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company offered certain former employees who had vested benefits in the Company's U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (the Revlon Employees' Retirement Plan) the option of receiving the present value of the participant's pension benefit in a one-time cash lump sum payment. Based on the participants' acceptance of that offer, $53.4\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nmillion was paid from the plan's assets to settle $66.9 million of pension liabilities, resulting in a $13.5 million net reduction of the Company's pension plan liabilities in 2015. In addition, the Company recorded a charge of $20.7 million as a result of the pension lump sum settlement accounting within costs of sales and SG&A expense in 2015. This charge was the result of accelerating a portion of the losses that were deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which are required to be recognized in the period in which the pension plan liabilities were settled. See Note 14, \"Savings Plan, Pension and Post-retirement Benefits,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details on this pension lump sum settlement.\nNon-cash Impairment Charge\nFor purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company's Pure Ice nail enamel brand, which was acquired in July 2012, is included within the Company's Global Color Brands reporting unit. Despite improvements in the net sales of Pure Ice nail enamel in 2015 and the realization of margin improvements through integrating the production of Pure Ice nail enamel within the Company's existing manufacturing processes, the Company continued to experience declines in the promotional activity for the Pure Ice brand at retailers. As a result, in conjunction with the Company's annual goodwill impairment test, the Company recorded a $9.7 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge during the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the Company's expectations regarding the future performance of the Global Color Brands reporting unit in relation to its carrying amount. See Note 8, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details on this non-cash goodwill impairment charge.\n2015 Debt Related Transaction\nIn March 2015, Products Corporation prepaid $24.6 million of term loan indebtedness, representing 50% of its 2014 \"excess cash flow\" in accordance with the terms of its Amended Term Loan Agreement. The prepayment was applied on a ratable basis between the principal amounts outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan and the Acquisition Term Loan. The amount of the prepayment that was applied to the 2011 Term Loan reduced the principal amount outstanding by $12.1 million to $662.9 million (as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan had been paid). The $12.5 million applied to the Acquisition Term Loan reduced Products Corporation's future regularly scheduled quarterly amortization payments under the Acquisition Term Loan on a ratable basis from $1.8 million prior to the prepayment to $1.7 million after giving effect to the prepayment and through its maturity on October 8, 2019. See Note 11, \"Long-Term Debt,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details.\nOperating Segments\nThe Company primarily operates in three segments: the Consumer segment, the Professional segment and the Other segment:\n \u2022 The Consumer segment is comprised of the Company's consumer brands, which primarily include Revlon, Almay, SinfulColors and Pure Ice in color cosmetics; Revlon ColorSilk in women's hair color; Revlon in beauty tools; and Mitchum in anti-perspirant deodorants. The Company's principal customers for its consumer products include large volume retailers, chain drug and food stores, chemist shops, hypermarkets, general merchandise stores, the Internet/e-commerce, television shopping, department stores, one-stop shopping beauty retailers, specialty cosmetics stores and perfumeries in the U.S. and internationally. The Consumer segment also includes a skincare line and a hair color line sold to large volume retailers and other retailers, primarily in Spain. \n \u2022 The Professional segment is comprised primarily of the Company's professional brands, which include Revlon Professional in hair color and hair care; CND-branded products in nail polishes and nail enhancements; and American Crew in men's grooming products, all of which are sold worldwide to professional salons. The Company's principal customers for its professional products include hair and nail salons and distributors to professional salons in the U.S. and internationally. The Professional segment also includes a multi-cultural hair care line consisting of Creme of Nature hair care products sold to professional salons, large volume retailers and other retailers, primarily in the U.S. \n \u2022 The Other segment primarily includes the operating results of the CBB business and related purchase accounting for the CBB Acquisition. CBB develops, manufactures, markets and distributes fragrances and other beauty products under various celebrity, lifestyle and fashion brands licensed from third parties, principally through department stores and selective distribution in international territories. The results included within the Other segment are not material to the Company's consolidated results of operations. \nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nResults of Operations\nIn the tables below, all amounts are in millions and numbers in parentheses ( ) denote unfavorable variances.\nConsolidated Net Sales:\nConsolidated net sales in 2015 were $1,914.3 million, a decrease of $26.7 million, or 1.4%, compared to $1,941.0 million in 2014. Excluding the $121.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, consolidated net sales increased $94.5 million, or 4.9%, during 2015, primarily driven by an increase in Consumer segment net sales of $53.9 million, or 3.7%, and the inclusion of $28.4 million of net sales as a result of the CBB Acquisition.\nConsolidated net sales in 2014 were $1,941.0 million, an increase of $446.3 million, or 29.9% as compared to $1,494.7 million in 2013. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations of $60.1 million, consolidated net sales increased $506.4 million, or 33.9% during 2014, primarily driven by the increase in net sales of $460.9 million as a result of the Colomer Acquisition in October 2013.\nSee \"Segment Results\" below for further discussion.\nSegment Results:\nThe Company's management evaluates segment profit, which is defined as income from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gains/losses on foreign currency fluctuations, gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt and miscellaneous expenses, for each of the Company's reportable segments. Segment profit also excludes unallocated corporate expenses and the impact of certain items that are not directly attributable to the segments' underlying operating performance, which includes the impact of: (i) restructuring and related charges; (ii) acquisition and integration costs; (iii) goodwill impairment charges; (iv) pension lump sum settlement charge; (v) costs of sales resulting from fair value adjustments to inventory acquired in acquisitions; (vi) deferred compensation related to the CBB Acquisition; (vii) insurance proceeds received in 2013 related to the 2011 fire that destroyed the Company's facility in Venezuela; and (viii) an accrual for estimated clean-up costs related to the Company's facility in Venezuela. Unallocated corporate expenses primarily include general and administrative expenses related to the corporate organization. These expenses are recorded in unallocated corporate expenses as these items are centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company removed pension-related costs for its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans from the measurement of its operating segment results. As a result, $8.2 million and $4.9 million of pension-related costs were reclassified from the measurement of Consumer segment profit and included as a component of unallocated corporate expenses for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company does not have any material inter-segment sales. For a reconciliation of segment profit to income from continuing operations before income taxes, see Note 18, \"Segment Data and Related Information\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe following tables provide a comparative summary of the Company's segment results for each of 2015, 2014 and 2013. In the tables below, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. Consumer segment net sales and segment profit include the results of retail brands acquired in the Colomer Acquisition, which had previously been included in the Professional segment.\nTable 117:

Segment\nConsumer segment net sales in 2015 were $1,414.8 million, a decrease of $23.5 million, or 1.6%, compared to $1,438.3 million in 2014. Excluding the $77.4 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations (referred to herein as on an \"XFX basis\"), total Consumer net sales increased $53.9 million, or 3.7%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products, Revlon ColorSilk hair color and Cutex nail products, partially offset by lower net sales of Almay color cosmetics. Consumer segment net sales were negatively impacted in connection with the Company's exit of its business operations in Venezuela in the second quarter of 2015 and change to a distributor model, as such change resulted in $1.0 million of net sales in Venezuela in 2015, compared to $16.3 million of net sales in Venezuela in 2014. Excluding Venezuela, on an XFX basis, Consumer net sales would have increased by 4.4% in 2015, compared to 2014.\nConsumer segment profit in 2015 was $360.2 million, an increase of $20.8 million, or 6.1%, compared to $339.4 million in 2014. Excluding the $9.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, Consumer segment profit increased $30.0 million, or 8.8%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher gross profit as a result of the increases in net sales discussed above, partially offset by $8.7 million of higher brand support expenses for the Company's Consumer brands. In connection with the Company's exit of its business operations in Venezuela in the second quarter of 2015 and change to a distributor model, there was no profit in Venezuela in 2015, compared to $6.6 million of profit in Venezuela in 2014. Excluding Venezuela, on an XFX basis, Consumer segment profit would have increased by 11.1% in 2015, compared to 2014.\nConsumer segment net sales in 2014 were $1,438.3 million, an increase of $44.1 million, or 3.2%, compared to $1,394.2 million in 2013. Excluding the $54.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, total Consumer net sales increased $98.3 million, or 7.1%, in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily driven by: (i) the inclusion of $52.8 million of increased net sales from Consumer brands acquired in the Colomer Acquisition; (ii) $15.1 million of favorable sales returns reserve adjustments in the U.S. during 2014, as a result of lower expected discontinued products in the future related to the Company's strategy to focus on fewer, bigger and better innovations, partially offset by increased sales returns expense for 2014 sales returns; and (iii) higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, Revlon ColorSilk hair color and Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products. The increases in Consumer segment net sales in 2014 were partially offset by lower net sales of fragrances, as well as lower net sales of Almay, SinfulColors and Pure Ice color cosmetics.\nConsumer segment profit in 2014 was $339.4 million, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 0.8%, compared to $342.3 million in 2013, primarily due to lower gross profit as a result of $33.0 million of higher advertising expense to support the Company's Consumer brands, and approximately $17.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by the increase in net sales, including the $15.1 million of favorable sales returns reserve adjustments.\nProfessional Segment\nProfessional segment net sales in 2015 were $471.1 million, a decrease of $31.6 million, or 6.3%, compared to $502.7 million in 2014. Excluding the $43.8 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, total Professional net sales increased $12.2 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of higher net sales of American Crew men's grooming products, Revlon Professional hair products and Creme of Nature hair products, partially offset by lower net sales of CND nail products in the U.S.\nProfessional segment profit in 2015 was $103.9 million, a decrease of $0.9 million, or 0.9%, compared to $104.8 million in 2014. Excluding the $3.7 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, Professional segment profit increased $2.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to higher net sales, partially offset by $5.1 million of higher brand support\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nexpenses for the Company's Professional brands. In addition, Professional segment profit in 2014 included a favorable adjustment of $3.4 million related to the inventory obsolescence reserve, with no similar adjustment in 2015.\nThe Company's Professional segment is comprised of most of the operations acquired by the Company in the Colomer Acquisition in October 2013 (with the exception of the retail brands acquired in the Colomer Acquisition, which the Company has included within the Consumer segment, as noted above). As Colomer was acquired in October 2013, there are no full year comparable prior years' net sales or segment profit for the Professional segment to facilitate a comparison of 2014 and 2013 Professional segment results. Therefore, an analysis of net sales and segment profit for the Professional segment in 2014, compared to 2013, is not included in this Form 10-K. Professional net sales were $502.7 million for the full year of 2014 and $100.5 million from the October 2013 Colomer Acquisition Date through the end of 2013. Professional net sales during each period consisted primarily of the net sales of CND products worldwide, including CND Shellac; Revlon Professional products, primarily in Europe; and American Crew products and other professional brands world-wide.\nProfessional segment profit was $104.8 million for the full year of 2014 and $5.1 million from the October 2013 Colomer Acquisition Date through the end of 2013 and is comprised of the operating results of substantially all of the operations acquired in the Colomer Acquisition.\nGeographic Results:\nIn connection with changes that the organization made to its management reporting structure following the Colomer Acquisition, beginning in 2014, the Company combined its former Latin America and Canada; Asia Pacific; and Europe, Middle East and Africa operating regions into the International region for reporting purposes.

Net sales in the U.S. decreased in the Professional segment primarily due to lower net sales of CND nail products.\nIn the U.S., net sales in 2014 increased $189.1 million, or 22.7%, to $1,021.9 million, as compared to $832.8 million in 2013, primarily due to the inclusion of $157.1 million of increased net sales as a result of the Colomer Acquisition. 2014 net sales in the U.S. were also impacted by $15.1 million of favorable sales returns reserve adjustments during 2014, as a result of lower expected discontinued products in the future related to the Company's strategy to focus on fewer, bigger and better innovations, partially offset by increased sales returns expense for 2014 sales returns. In addition, 2014 had higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, Revlon ColorSilk hair color and Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products, partially offset by lower net sales of Almay, SinfulColors and Pure Ice color cosmetics.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nInternational\nInternational net sales in 2015 decreased by $48.5 million, or 5.3%, to $870.6 million, as compared to $919.1 million in 2014. Excluding the $121.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, International net sales increased by $72.7 million, or 7.9%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics in the Consumer segment. International net sales increased in the Professional segment primarily due to higher net sales of American Crew men's grooming products and Revlon Professional hair products. From a geographic perspective, the increase in international net sales was throughout most of the Company's International region. The Company's exit of its business operations in Venezuela in 2015 negatively impacted International net sales. Excluding Venezuela, on an XFX basis, International net sales would have increased by 9.0% in 2015, compared to 2014.\nInternational net sales in 2014 increased $257.2 million, or 38.9%, to $919.1 million, as compared to $661.9 million in 2013. Excluding the $60.1 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, International net sales increased by $317.3 million, or 47.9%, primarily due to the inclusion of $303.8 million of increased net sales as a result of the Colomer Acquisition. Additionally, 2014 net sales were impacted by higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics in Venezuela and Japan and Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products primarily in the U.K., partially offset by lower net sales of Revlon color cosmetics in certain distributor markets and fragrances in the U.K. and Italy.

The cash held by the Company's foreign operations is primarily used to fund such operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources of cash to fund these needs. As part of this assessment, the Company determines the amount of foreign earnings, if any, that it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs, including for the Company's debt service obligations, and pays applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes, if any, on such earnings to the extent repatriated, and otherwise records a tax liability for the estimated cost of repatriation in a future period. The Company believes that the cash generated by its domestic operations and availability under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility and other permitted lines of credit should be sufficient to meet its domestic liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. Therefore, the Company currently anticipates that restrictions and/or taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings will not have a material effect on the Company's liquidity during such period.\nChanges in Cash Flows\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $326.9 million, compared with $275.3 million at December 31, 2014.

The prepayment was applied on a ratable basis between the principal amounts outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan and the Acquisition Term Loan. The amount of the prepayment applied to the 2011 Term Loan reduced the principal amount outstanding by $12.1 million to $662.9 million (as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan had been paid). The $12.5 million applied to the Acquisition Term Loan reduced Products Corporation's future regularly scheduled quarterly amortization payments under the Acquisition Term Loan on a ratable basis from $1.8 million prior to the prepayment to $1.7 million after giving effect to the prepayment and through its maturity on October 8, 2019.\n2014 Debt Related Transactions\nFebruary 2014 Term Loan Amendment\nIn February 2014, Products Corporation entered into an amendment (the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment\u201d) to its Amended Term Loan Agreement among Products Corporation, as borrower, a syndicate of lenders and Citicorp USA, Inc. ( CUSA\u201d), as administrative agent and collateral agent.\nPursuant to the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment, the interest rates applicable to Eurodollar Loans under the 2011 Term Loan bear interest at the Eurodollar Rate plus 2.5% per annum, with the Eurodollar Rate not to be less than 0.75% (compared to 3.0% and 1.0%, respectively, prior to the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment), while Alternate Base Rate Loans under the 2011 Term Loan bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus 1.5%, with the Alternate Base Rate not to be less than 1.75% (compared to 2.0% in each case prior to the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment) (and as each such term is defined in the Amended Term Loan Agreement).\nProducts Corporation's Acquisition Term Loan and Amended Revolving Credit Facility were not amended in connection with the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment.\nDuring 2014, the Company incurred approximately $1.1 million of fees and expenses in connection with the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment, which were expensed as incurred, and wrote-off $0.8 million of unamortized debt discount and deferred financing costs as a result of the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment. These amounts, totaling $1.9 million, were recognized within loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRepayment of Non-Contributed Loan\nOn May 1, 2014, Products Corporation used available cash on hand to optionally prepay in full the remaining $58.4 million principal amount then outstanding under the non-contributed loan portion of the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan Agreement (the \"Non-Contributed Loan\") that remained owing from Products Corporation to various third parties. The Non-Contributed Loan would have otherwise matured on October 8, 2014. In connection with such prepayment, the Company wrote-off $0.1 million of deferred financing costs, which were recognized within loss on early extinguishment of debt in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for 2014.\n2013 Debt Transactions\nTerm Loan and Revolving Credit Facility Amendments\n(i) February 2013 Term Loan Amendments\nIn February 2013, Products Corporation consummated amendments (the \"February 2013 Term Loan Amendments\") to its third amended and restated term loan agreement dated as of May 19, 2011 (as amended, the \"2011 Term Loan Agreement,\" or the 2011 Term Loan Facility\u201d or the \"2011 Term Loan\") among Products Corporation, as borrower, a syndicate of lenders and CUSA, as administrative agent and collateral agent.\nPursuant to the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments, Products Corporation reduced the total aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan at such time from $788.0 million to $675.0 million, using a portion of the proceeds from Products Corporation's issuance of its 5\u00be% Senior Notes (see 2013 Senior Notes Refinancing\u201d below), together with cash on hand. The February 2013 Term Loan Amendments also reduced the interest rates on the 2011 Term Loan such that (prior to giving effect to the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment) Eurodollar Loans bore interest at the Eurodollar Rate plus 3.00% per annum, with the Eurodollar Rate not to be less than 1.00% (compared to 3.50% and 1.25%, respectively, prior to the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments), while Alternate Base Rate Loans bore interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus 2.00%, with the Alternate Base Rate not to be less than 2.00% (compared to 2.50% and 2.25%, respectively, prior to the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments) (and as each such term is defined in the 2011 Term Loan Agreement).\nPursuant to the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments, Products Corporation, under certain circumstances, also has the right to request the 2011 Term Loan to be increased by up to the greater of: (i) $300 million; and (ii) an amount such that Products Corporation's First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2011 Term Loan Agreement) does not exceed 3.50:1.00 (compared to $300 million prior to the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments). The lenders are not committed to provide any such increase. Any such increase would be in addition to the Acquisition Term Loan.\n(ii) August 2013 Term Loan Amendments\nIn August 2013, in connection with the Colomer Acquisition, Products Corporation consummated further amendments (the \"August 2013 Term Loan Amendments\") to its 2011 Term Loan Agreement (as amended by the August 2013 Term Loan Amendments and the Incremental Amendment, the \"Amended Term Loan Agreement\" or the \"Amended Term Loan Facility\"), which permitted, among other things: (i) Products Corporation's consummation of the Colomer Acquisition; and (ii) Products Corporation's incurring up to $700 million of term loans which it used as a source of funds to consummate the Colomer Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses.\n(iii) Incremental Amendment\nIn August 2013, in connection with the Colomer Acquisition, Products Corporation entered into an incremental amendment (the \"Incremental Amendment\") resulting in the Amended Term Loan Agreement with Citibank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch (collectively, the \"Initial Acquisition Lenders\") and CUSA, as administrative agent and collateral agent, pursuant to which the Initial Acquisition Lenders committed to provide up to $700 million of term loans under the Amended Term Loan Agreement (the \"Acquisition Term Loan\"). The Acquisition Term Loan was issued on October 8, 2013 and Products Corporation used the net proceeds of $698.3 million as a source of funds to consummate the Colomer Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses.\n(iv) Amended Revolving Credit Facility\nIn August 2013, in connection with the Colomer Acquisition, Products Corporation consummated an amendment (the \"August 2013 Revolver Amendment\") to its third amended and restated revolving credit agreement dated June 16, 2011 (the \"2011 Revolving Credit Agreement\") which amended its then $140.0 million asset-backed, multi-currency revolving credit facility (the \"2011 Revolving Credit Facility\") to permit, among other things: (a) Products Corporation's consummation of the Colomer Acquisition; and (b) Products Corporation's incurring up to $700 million of the Acquisition Term Loan that Products Corporation used as a source of funds to consummate the Colomer Acquisition. Additionally, the August 2013 Revolver Amendment (1) reduced Products Corporation's interest rate spread over the LIBOR rate applicable to Eurodollar Loans under the facility from a range, based on availability, of 2.00% to 2.50%, to a range of 1.50% to 2.00%; (2) reduced the commitment fee on unused availability under the facility from 0.375% to 0.25%; and (3) extended the maturity of the facility, which was previously scheduled to mature in June 2016, to the earlier of (i) August 2018 or (ii) the date that is 90 days prior to the earliest maturity date of any term loans then outstanding under Products Corporation's bank term loan agreements, but not earlier than June 2016.\nAdditionally, in December 2013, Products Corporation entered into an incremental amendment (the \"December 2013 Revolver Amendment\" and together with the August 2013 Revolver Amendment, the \"2013 Revolver Amendments\") to its 2011 Revolving Credit Agreement (as amended by the 2013 Revolver Amendments, the \"Amended Revolving Credit Agreement\" and the \"Amended Revolving Credit Facility\"). Under the terms of the December 2013 Revolver Amendment, the lenders' commitment to provide borrowings to Products Corporation and its subsidiary borrowers under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility was increased from $140.0 million to $175.0 million.\n2013 Senior Notes Refinancing\nIn February 2013, Products Corporation issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5\u00be% Senior Notes due February 15, 2021 (the 5\u00be% Senior Notes\u201d) to investors at par. Products Corporation used $491.2 million of the net proceeds (net of underwriters' fees) from the issuance of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes to repay and redeem all of the $330.0 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its 9\u00be% Senior Secured Notes that were otherwise due November 2015 (the 9\u00be% Senior Secured Notes\"), as well as to pay an aggregate of $28.0 million for the applicable redemption and tender offer premiums, accrued interest and related fees and expenses. Products Corporation used a portion of the remaining proceeds, together with existing cash, to pay approximately $113.0 million of principal on its 2011 Term Loan in conjunction with the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments. Products Corporation used the remaining balance available from the issuance of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, debt reduction transactions, including the repayment of the Contributed Loan (as hereinafter defined) as described below.\nRepayment of the Contributed Loan\nOn October 8, 2013, Products Corporation paid to Revlon, Inc. at maturity the remaining $48.6 million portion of the principal amount then due under the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan Agreement (the \"Contributed Loan\"), which Revlon, Inc. used to pay the liquidation preference of Revlon, Inc.'s Series A Preferred Stock in connection with its mandatory redemption of such stock on such date.\n(b) Summary of Terms and Covenants\nAmended Credit Agreements\nThe following is a summary description of the Amended Term Loan Facility, which includes the 2011 Term Loan and the Acquisition Term Loan, and the Amended Revolving Credit Facility. Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms have the meanings given to them in the Amended Term Loan Agreement and/or the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement (the \"Amended Credit Agreements\"), as applicable. Investors should refer to the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement and/or the Amended Term Loan Agreement for complete terms and conditions, as these summary descriptions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions.\nAmended Term Loan Facility\nAs of December 31, 2015, term loans under the Amended Term Loan Facility bear interest at the following interest rates:\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Eurodollar Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Alternate Base Rate Loans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2011 Term Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Eurodollar Rate plus 2.50% per annum (with the Eurodollar Rate not to be less than 0.75%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Alternate Base Rate plus 1.50% (with the Alternate Base Rate not to be less than 1.75%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition Term Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Eurodollar Rate plus 3.00% per annum (with the Eurodollar Rate not to be less than 1.00%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Alternate Base Rate plus 2.00% (with the Alternate Base Rate not to be less than 2.00%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe term loans under the Amended Term Loan Facility are required to be prepaid with:\n(i) the net cash proceeds in excess of $10 million for each 12-month period ending on March 31 received during such period from sales of Term Loan First Lien Collateral by Products Corporation or any of its subsidiary guarantors with carryover of unused annual basket amounts up to a maximum of $25 million and with respect to certain specified dispositions up to an additional $25 million in the aggregate (subject to a reinvestment right for 365 days, or 545 days if the Company has within such 365-day period entered into a legally binding commitment to invest such funds);\n(ii) the net proceeds from the issuance by Products Corporation or any of its subsidiaries of certain additional debt; and\n(iii) 50% of Products Corporation's annual excess cash flow\u201d (as defined under the Amended Term Loan Agreement), which payments commenced with respect to Products Corporation's excess cash flow for the 2014 fiscal year; such payments are required to be made within the first 100 days after the applicable year end.\nPursuant to the August 2013 Term Loan Amendments, the Amended Term Loan Facility contains a financial covenant limiting Products Corporation's first lien senior secured leverage ratio (the ratio of Products Corporation's senior secured debt that has a lien on the collateral which secures the Amended Term Loan Facility that is not junior or subordinated to the liens securing the Amended Term Loan Facility (excluding debt outstanding under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility) to EBITDA, as each such term is defined in the Amended Term Loan Facility), to no more than 4.25 to 1.0 for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending during the period from June 30, 2011 to the maturity date of the Amended Term Loan Facility.\nProducts Corporation, under certain circumstances, also has the right to request the Amended Term Loan Facility to be increased by up to the greater of (i) $300 million and (ii) an amount such that Products Corporation's First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Term Loan Agreement) does not exceed 3.50:1.00 (compared to $300 million prior to the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments). The lenders are not committed to provide any such increase. Any such increase would be in addition to the Acquisition Term Loan that was issued in October 2013 and used as a source of funds to consummate the Colomer Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses.\nThe 2011 Term Loan outstanding under the Amended Term Loan Facility matures on November 19, 2017. The Acquisition Term Loan under the Amended Term Loan Facility has the same terms as the 2011 Term Loan, except that: (i) it matures on the sixth anniversary of the closing of the Acquisition Term Loan (or October 8, 2019); and (ii) it amortizes on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year, in an amount equal to 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of such Acquisition Term Loan.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Products Corporation is required to prepay, on or before 100 days following the last day of its fiscal year (i.e., by April 9, 2016), $23.2 million of indebtedness under the Amended Term Loan Facility, representing 50% of its 2015 \"excess cash flow\" (as defined under the Amended Term Loan Agreement). The prepayment will be applied on a ratable basis between the principal amounts outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan and the Acquisition Term Loan. The amount of the prepayment to be applied to the 2011 Term Loan will be used to reduce the aggregate principal amount outstanding (as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan have been paid), while the amount to be applied to the Acquisition Term Loan will be used to reduce Products Corporation's future annual amortization payments (which are payable in equal quarterly installments) on a ratable basis from $6.9 million prior to the prepayment to $6.8 million after giving effect to the prepayment and through its maturity on October 8, 2019.\nAmended Revolving Credit Facility\nAvailability under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility varies based on a borrowing base that is determined by the value of eligible trade receivables and eligible inventory in the U.S. and the U.K. and eligible real property and equipment in the U.S. from time to time.\nIn January 2014, the Colomer U.S. Subsidiaries became additional guarantors under Products Corporation's Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility and the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture. In January and May 2015, the New U.S. Subsidiaries became additional guarantors under such debt instruments. In connection with becoming guarantors, substantially all of the assets of such subsidiaries were pledged as collateral under Products Corporation's Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility, thereby increasing the value of the assets supporting the borrowing base under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility.\nIf the value of the eligible assets is not sufficient to support the $175.0 million borrowing base under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, Products Corporation will not have full access to the Amended Revolving Credit Facility. Products Corporation's ability to borrow under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility is also conditioned upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent and Products Corporation's compliance with other covenants in the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement.\nIn each case subject to borrowing base availability, the Amended Revolving Credit Facility is available to:\n(i) Products Corporation in revolving credit loans denominated in U.S. Dollars;\n(ii) Products Corporation in swing line loans denominated in U.S. Dollars up to $30.0 million;\n(iii) Products Corporation in standby and commercial letters of credit denominated in U.S. Dollars and other currencies up to $60.0 million; and\n(iv) Products Corporation and certain of its international subsidiaries designated from time to time in revolving credit loans and bankers' acceptances denominated in U.S. Dollars and other currencies.\nAs a result of the August 2013 Revolver Amendment, under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, borrowings (other than loans in foreign currencies) bear interest, if made as Eurodollar Loans, at the Eurodollar Rate plus the applicable margin set forth in the grid below and, if made as Alternate Base Rate Loans, at the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin set forth in the grid below.\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excess Availability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Alternate Base Rate Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Eurodollar Loans, Eurocurrency Loan or Local Rate Loans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than or equal to $92,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.50%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less than $92,000,000 but greater than or equal to $46,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.75%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.75%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less than $46,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.00%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLocal Loans (as defined in the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement) bear interest, if mutually acceptable to Products Corporation and the relevant foreign lenders, at the Local Rate, and otherwise (i) if in foreign currencies or in U.S. Dollars at the Eurodollar Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate plus the applicable margin set forth in the grid above or (ii) if in U.S. Dollars at the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin set forth in the grid above.\nPrior to the termination date of the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, revolving loans are required to be prepaid (without any permanent reduction in commitment) with:\n(i) the net cash proceeds from sales of Revolving Credit First Lien Collateral by Products Corporation or any of Products Corporation's subsidiary guarantors (other than dispositions in the ordinary course of business and certain other exceptions); and\n(ii) the net proceeds from the issuance by Products Corporation or any of its subsidiaries of certain additional debt, to the extent there remains any such proceeds after satisfying Products Corporation's repayment obligations under the Amended Term Loan Facility.\nAs a result of the August 2013 Revolver Amendment, Products Corporation pays to the lenders under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility a commitment fee of 0.25% of the average daily unused portion of the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, which fee is payable quarterly in arrears. Under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, Products Corporation also pays:\n(i) to foreign lenders a fronting fee of 0.25% per annum on the aggregate principal amount of specified Local Loans (which fee is retained by foreign lenders out of the portion of the Applicable Margin payable to such foreign lender);\n(ii) to foreign lenders an administrative fee of 0.25% per annum on the aggregate principal amount of specified Local Loans;\n(iii) to the multi-currency lenders a letter of credit commission equal to the product of (a) the Applicable Margin for revolving credit loans that are Eurodollar Rate loans (adjusted for the term that the letter of credit is outstanding) and (b) the aggregate undrawn face amount of letters of credit; and\n(iv) to the issuing lender, a letter of credit fronting fee of 0.25% per annum of the aggregate undrawn face amount of letters of credit, which fee is a portion of the Applicable Margin.\nAs a result of the August 2013 Revolver Amendment, under certain circumstances, Products Corporation has the right to request that the Amended Revolving Credit Facility be increased by up to $100.0 million. The lenders are not committed to provide any such increase.\nUnder certain circumstances, if and when the difference between (i) the borrowing base under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) the amounts outstanding under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility is less than $20.0 million for a period of two consecutive days or more, and until such difference is equal to or greater than $20.0 million for a period of 30 consecutive business days, the Amended Revolving Credit Facility requires Products Corporation to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (the ratio of EBITDA minus Capital Expenditures to Cash Interest Expense for such period) of a minimum of 1.0 to 1.0.\nThe Amended Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of August 14, 2018 and the date that is 90 days prior to the earliest maturity date of any term loans then outstanding under the Amended Term Loan Facility, but not earlier than June 16, 2016.\nCovenants and Defaults Applicable to the Amended Term Loan Facility and the Amended Revolving Credit Facility\nThe Amended Credit Agreements contain various restrictive covenants prohibiting Products Corporation and its subsidiaries from:\n(i) incurring additional indebtedness or guarantees, with certain exceptions;\n(ii) making dividend and other payments or loans to Revlon, Inc. or other affiliates, with certain exceptions, including among others:\n(a) exceptions permitting Products Corporation to pay dividends or make other payments to Revlon, Inc. to enable it to, among other things, pay expenses incidental to being a public holding company, including, among other things, professional fees such as legal, accounting and insurance fees, regulatory fees, such as SEC filing fees and NYSE listing fees, and other expenses related to being a public holding company;\n(b) subject to certain circumstances, to finance the purchase by Revlon, Inc. of its Class A Common Stock in connection with the delivery of such Class A Common Stock to grantees under the Fourth Amended and Restated Revlon, Inc. Stock Plan and/or the payment of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards under such plan;\n(c) subject to certain limitations, to pay dividends or make other payments to finance the purchase, redemption or other retirement for value by Revlon, Inc. of stock or other equity interests or equivalents in Revlon, Inc. held by any current or former director, employee or consultant in his or her capacity as such; and\n(d) subject to certain limitations, to make other restricted payments to Products Corporation's affiliates in an amount up to $10 million per year (plus $10 million for each calendar year commencing with 2011), other restricted payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $35 million and certain other restricted payments, including without limitation those based upon certain financial tests;\n(iii) creating liens or other encumbrances on Products Corporation's or its subsidiaries' assets or revenues, granting negative pledges or selling or transferring any of Products Corporation's or its subsidiaries' assets, all subject to certain limited exceptions;\n(iv) with certain exceptions, engaging in merger or acquisition transactions;\n(v) prepaying indebtedness and modifying the terms of certain indebtedness and specified material contractual obligations, subject to certain exceptions;\n(vi) making investments, subject to certain exceptions; and\n(vii) entering into transactions with Products Corporation's affiliates involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $10 million other than upon terms that are not materially less favorable when taken as a whole to Products Corporation or its subsidiaries as terms that would be obtainable at the time for a comparable transaction or series of similar transactions in arm's length dealings with an unrelated third person and where such payments or consideration exceed $20 million, unless such transaction has been approved by all of Products Corporation's independent directors, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe events of default under each of the Amended Term Loan Agreement and the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement include customary events of default for such types of agreements. For a description of the events of defaults, see Note 11, \"Long-Term Debt\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. If Products Corporation is in default under the senior secured leverage ratio under the Amended Term Loan Facility or the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio under the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement, Products Corporation may cure such default by issuing certain equity securities to, or receiving capital contributions from, Revlon, Inc. and applying such cash which is deemed to increase EBITDA for the purpose of calculating the applicable ratio. Products Corporation may exercise this cure right two times in any four-quarter period.\nProducts Corporation was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Amended Term Loan Agreement and the Amended Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, the aggregate principal amounts outstanding under the Acquisition Term Loan and the 2011 Term Loan were $673.7 million and $662.9 million, respectively, and availability under the $175.0 million Amended Revolving Credit Facility, based upon the calculated borrowing base less $8.8 million of outstanding undrawn letters of credit and nil then drawn on the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, was $166.2 million. There were no borrowings under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility during 2015.\n5\u00be% Senior Notes\nIn February 2013, Products Corporation completed its offering (the \"2013 Senior Notes Refinancing\"), pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the \"Securities Act\"), of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes. The 5\u00be% Senior Notes are unsecured and were issued under the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture to investors at par. The 5\u00be% Senior Notes mature on February 15, 2021. Interest on the 5\u00be% Senior Notes accrues at 5\u00be% per annum, paid every six months on February 15th and August 15th. The 5\u00be% Senior Notes were issued pursuant to the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture, dated as of February 8, 2013 (the Notes Closing Date\u201d), by and among Products Corporation, Products Corporation's domestic subsidiaries (the Guarantors\u201d), which also currently guarantee Products Corporation's Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Guarantors issued guarantees (the Guarantees\u201d) of Products Corporation's obligations under the 5\u00be% Senior Notes and the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture on a joint and several, senior unsecured basis. The Colomer U.S. Subsidiaries became additional guarantors in January 2014 and the New U.S. Subsidiaries became additional guarantors in January and May 2015, in each case under Products Corporation's Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility and the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture.\nIn December 2013, Products Corporation consummated an offer to exchange the original 5\u00be% Senior Notes for $500 million of new 5\u00be% Senior Notes, which have substantially the same terms as the original 5\u00be% Senior Notes, except that they are registered under the Securities Act (such registered new notes being the 5\u00be% Senior Notes\u201d).\nProducts Corporation used a portion of the $491.2 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes (net of underwriters' fees) to repay and redeem all of the $330.0 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its 9\u00be% Senior Secured Notes, as well as to pay $8.6 million of accrued interest. Products Corporation incurred an aggregate of $19.4 million of fees for the applicable redemption and tender offer premiums, related fees and expenses in connection with redemption and repayment of the 9\u00be% Senior Secured Notes and other fees and expenses in connection with the issuance of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes. Products Corporation used a portion of the remaining proceeds from the issuance of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes, together with existing cash, to pay approximately $113.0 million of principal on its 2011 Term Loan in conjunction with the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments. Products Corporation used the remaining balance available from the issuance of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, debt reduction transactions, such as repaying to Revlon, Inc. at maturity on October 8, 2013 the Contributed Loan, which Revlon, Inc. used to pay the liquidation preference of Revlon, Inc.'s then outstanding Series A Preferred Stock in connection with its mandatory redemption on such date.\nRanking\nThe 5\u00be% Senior Notes are Products Corporation's unsubordinated, unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated obligations of Products Corporation and rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior debt of Products Corporation. Similarly, each Guarantee is the relevant Guarantor's joint and several, unsubordinated and unsecured obligation and ranks senior in right of payment to any future subordinated obligations of such Guarantor and ranks pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior debt of such Guarantor. The Guarantees were issued on a joint and several basis.\nThe 5\u00be% Senior Notes and the Guarantees rank effectively junior to Products Corporation's Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility, which are secured, as well as indebtedness and preferred stock of Products Corporation's foreign and immaterial subsidiaries (the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries\u201d), none of which guarantee the 5\u00be% Senior Notes.\nOptional Redemption\nOn and after February 15, 2016, the 5\u00be% Senior Notes may be redeemed at Products Corporation's option, at any time as a whole, or from time to time in part, at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount), plus accrued interest to the date of redemption, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on February 15th of the years indicated below:\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.313\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.875\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101.438\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019 and thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.000\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProducts Corporation may redeem the 5\u00be% Senior Notes at its option at any time or from time to time prior to February 15, 2016, as a whole or in part, at a redemption price per 5\u00be% Senior Note equal to the sum of: (1) the then outstanding principal amount thereof; plus (2) accrued and unpaid interest (if any) to the date of redemption; and plus (3) the applicable premium based on the applicable treasury rate plus 75 basis points.\nPrior to February 15, 2016, Products Corporation may, from time to time, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes and any additional notes with, and to the extent Products Corporation actually receives, the net proceeds of one or more equity offerings from time to time, at 105.75%of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption.\nChange of Control\nUpon the occurrence of specified change of control events, Products Corporation is required to make an offer to purchase all of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the outstanding principal amount of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes as of the date of any such repurchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.\nCertain Covenants\nThe 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture limits Products Corporation's and the Guarantors' ability, and the ability of certain other subsidiaries, to:\n \u2022 incur or guarantee additional indebtedness ( Limitation on Debt\u201d); \n \u2022 pay dividends, make repayments on indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the 5\u00be% Senior Notes and make other restricted payments\u201d ( Limitation on Restricted Payments\u201d); \n \u2022 make certain investments; \n \u2022 create liens on their assets to secure debt; \n \u2022 enter into transactions with affiliates; \n \u2022 merge, consolidate or amalgamate with another company ( Successor Company\u201d); \n \u2022 transfer and sell assets ( Limitation on Asset Sales\u201d); and \n \u2022 permit restrictions on the payment of dividends by Products Corporation's subsidiaries ( Limitation on Dividends from Subsidiaries\u201d).  These covenants are subject to important qualifications and exceptions. The 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture also contains customary affirmative covenants and events of default.\nIn addition, if during any period of time the 5\u00be% Senior Notes receive investment grade ratings from both Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture, Products Corporation and its subsidiaries will not be subject to the covenants on Limitation on Debt, Limitation on Restricted Payments, Limitation on Asset Sales, Limitation on Dividends from Subsidiaries and certain provisions of the Successor Company covenant.\nCovenants\nProducts Corporation was in compliance with all applicable covenants under its 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nSpanish Government Loan\nIn connection with the Colomer Acquisition, the Company acquired the Colomer Group's euro-denominated loan payable to the Spanish government (the \"Spanish Government Loan\"), which loan had $0.6 million aggregate principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2015 (based on foreign exchange rates in effect as of such date). The Spanish Government Loan does not bear interest and is payable in 10 equal installments on June 30th of each year beginning in 2016 through 2025.\nImpact of Foreign Currency Translation - Venezuela\nRevlon Venezuela's net sales are de minimis, representing approximately 1% of the Company's consolidated net sales for each 2015, 2014 and 2013. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, Revlon Venezuela's assets represented approximately 1% of the Company's total assets, respectively.\nVenezuela - Highly-Inflationary Economy: Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. As a result, beginning January 1, 2010, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency for the Company's subsidiary in Venezuela ( Revlon Venezuela\u201d). As Venezuela is designated as highly inflationary, foreign currency translation adjustments of Revlon Venezuela's balance sheet have been reflected in the Company's earnings.\nVenezuela - Currency Restrictions: Foreign currency restrictions enacted by the Venezuelan government since 2003 have become more restrictive and have impacted Revlon Venezuela's ability to obtain U.S. Dollars in exchange for Venezuelan Bolivars (\"Bolivars\") at the official foreign exchange rates from the Venezuelan government and its foreign exchange commission, the Comisi\u00f3n de Administracion de Divisas ( CADIVI\u201d). In May 2010, the Venezuelan government took control over the previously freely-traded foreign currency exchange market and, in June 2010, replaced it with a new foreign currency exchange system, the Sistema de Transacciones en Moneda Extranjera ( SITME\u201d). In the second quarter of 2011, the Company began using a SITME rate of 5.5 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar (the \"SITME Rate\") to translate Revlon Venezuela's financial statements, as this was the rate at which the Company accessed U.S. Dollars in the SITME market during this period. Through December 31, 2012, the Company continued using the SITME Rate to translate Revlon Venezuela's financial statements.\nVenezuela - 2013 Foreign Currency Devaluation: In February 2013, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of Bolivars relative to the U.S. Dollar, changing the official exchange rate to 6.3 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar (the \"Official Rate\"). The Venezuelan government also announced that the SITME foreign currency market administered by Venezuela's central bank would be eliminated, and as a result, the Company began using the Official Rate to translate Revlon Venezuela's financial statements beginning in 2013. To reflect the impact of the foreign currency devaluation, the Company recorded a one-time foreign currency loss of $0.6 million in earnings in the first quarter of 2013 as a result of the required re-measurement of Revlon Venezuela's monetary assets and liabilities.\nVenezuela - 2014 Foreign Currency Devaluation: In January 2014, the Venezuela government announced that the CADIVI would be replaced by the government-operated National Center of Foreign Commerce (the \"CENCOEX\"), and indicated that the Sistema Complementario de Administraci\u00f3n de Divisas ( SICAD\u201d) market would continue to be offered as an alternative foreign currency exchange. Additionally, a parallel foreign currency exchange system, SICAD II, started functioning in March 2014 and allowed companies to apply for the purchase of foreign currency and foreign currency denominated securities for any legal use or purpose. Throughout 2014, the Company exchanged Bolivars for U.S. Dollars to the extent permitted through the various foreign currency markets available based on its ability to participate in those markets. Prior to June 30, 2014, the Company utilized the Official Rate and following a consideration of the Company's specific facts and circumstances, which included its legal ability and intent to participate in the SICAD II exchange market to import finished goods into Venezuela, the Company determined that it was appropriate to utilize the SICAD II rate of 53 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar (the \"SICAD II Rate\") to translate Revlon Venezuela's financial statements beginning on June 30, 2014. As a result, the Company recorded a foreign currency loss of $6.0 million in the second quarter of 2014 related to the required re-measurement of Revlon Venezuela's monetary assets and liabilities. For 2014, the change to the SICAD II Rate of 53 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar, as compared to the Official Rate of 6.3 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar, had the impact of reducing the Company's consolidated net sales by $16.2 million and reducing the Company's consolidated operating income by $8.4 million.\nVenezuela - 2015 Foreign Currency Devaluation: In February 2015, the Venezuela government introduced a new foreign currency exchange platform, the Marginal Currency System (\"SIMADI\"), which created a third new mechanism to exchange Bolivars for U.S. Dollars through private brokers. SIMADI replaced the SICAD II system and started operating on February 12, 2015. As a result, the Company considered its specific facts and circumstances in order to determine the appropriate rate of exchange to translate Revlon Venezuela's financial statements. Through December 31, 2015, the Company has not participated in the SIMADI exchange market; however, given the elimination of the SICAD II system, the Company determined that it was appropriate to use the SIMADI rate of 193 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar (the \"SIMADI Rate\") to translate Revlon Venezuela's balance sheet beginning on March 31, 2015.\nAs a result of the change from the SICAD II Rate to the SIMADI Rate on March 31, 2015, the Company was required to re-measure all of Revlon Venezuela's monetary assets and liabilities at the SIMADI Rate. Using the SIMADI Rate, the Company recorded a foreign currency loss of $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2015 as a result of the required re-measurement of Revlon Venezuela's balance sheet. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company exited its business operations in Venezuela and changed to a distributor model. Current or additional governmental restrictions, worsening import authorization controls, price and profit controls or labor unrest in Venezuela could impact the Company's ability to sell to the distributor in Venezuela.\nSources and Uses\nThe Company's principal sources of funds are expected to be operating revenues, cash on hand and funds available for borrowing under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility and other permitted lines of credit. The Amended Credit Agreements, and the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture contain certain provisions that by their terms limit Products Corporation and its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur additional debt.\nThe Company's principal uses of funds are expected to be the payment of operating expenses, including expenses in connection with the continued execution of the Company's business strategy; purchases of permanent wall displays; capital expenditure requirements; debt service payments and costs; cash tax payments; pension and other post-retirement benefit plan contributions; payments in connection with the Company's restructuring programs; business and/or brand acquisitions (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), if any; severance not otherwise included in the Company's restructuring programs; debt and/or equity repurchases, if any; costs related to litigation; and payments in connection with discontinuing non-core business lines and/or exiting certain territories. The Company's cash contributions to its pension and post-retirement benefit plans in 2015 were $18.1 million. The Company expects cash contributions to its pension and post-retirement benefit plans to be approximately $20 million in the aggregate for 2016. The Company's cash taxes paid in 2015 were $25.2 million. The Company expects to pay cash taxes of approximately $55 million in the aggregate for 2016. The Company's purchases of permanent wall displays and capital expenditures in 2015 were $47.4 million and $48.3 million, respectively. The Company expects purchases of permanent wall displays and capital expenditures to be approximately $50.0 million and $55.0 million, respectively, in the aggregate for 2016. See also Note 2, \"Business Combinations,\" for discussion regarding the utilization of funds related to the Company's April 2015 CBB Acquisition.\nThe Company has undertaken, and continues to assess, refine and implement, a number of programs to efficiently manage its working capital, including, among other things, initiatives intended to optimize inventory levels over time; centralized procurement to secure discounts and efficiencies; prudent management of trade receivables and accounts payable; and controls on general and administrative spending. In the ordinary course of business, the Company's source or use of cash from operating activities may vary on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of working capital flows.\nContinuing to execute the Company's business strategy could include taking advantage of additional opportunities to reposition, repackage or reformulate one or more brands or product lines, launching additional new products, acquiring businesses or brands (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), divesting or discontinuing non-core business lines (which may include exiting certain territories), further refining the Company's approach to retail merchandising and/or taking further actions to optimize its manufacturing, sourcing and organizational size and structure, including optimizing the Colomer Acquisition and CBB Acquisition. Any of these actions, the intended purpose of which would be to create value through improving the Company's financial performance, could result in the Company making investments and/or recognizing charges related to executing against such opportunities. Any such activities may be funded with cash on hand, funds available under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility and/or other permitted additional sources of capital, which actions could increase the Company's total debt.\nThe Company may also, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt obligations and/or equity in open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise and may seek to refinance some or all of its indebtedness based upon market conditions. Any retirement or purchase of debt and/or equity may be funded with operating cash flows of the business or other sources and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may be material.\nThe Company expects that operating revenues, cash on hand and funds available for borrowing under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility and other permitted lines of credit will be sufficient to enable the Company to pay its operating expenses for 2016, including expenses in connection with the execution of the Company's business strategy, purchases of permanent wall displays, capital expenditure requirements, debt service payments and costs, cash tax payments, pension and other post-retirement plan contributions, payments in connection with the Company's restructuring programs, business and/or brand acquisitions (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), if any, severance not otherwise included in the Company's restructuring programs, debt and/or equity repurchases, if any, costs related to litigation and/or discontinuing non-core business lines and/or exiting certain territories.\nThere can be no assurance that available funds will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements on a consolidated basis. If the Company's anticipated level of revenues is not achieved because of, among other things, decreased consumer spending in response to weak economic conditions or weakness in the consumption of beauty care products in one or more of the Consumer, Professional and/or Other segments; adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency controls and/or government-mandated pricing controls; decreased sales of the Company's products as a result of increased competitive activities by the Company's competitors and/or decreased performance by third party suppliers; changes in consumer purchasing habits, including with respect to retailer preferences and/or among professional salons; inventory management by the Company's customers; space reconfigurations or reductions in display space by the Company's customers; changes in pricing, marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies by the Company's customers; or less than anticipated results from the Company's existing or new products or from its advertising, promotional, pricing and/or marketing plans; or if the Company's expenses, including, without limitation, for restructuring costs, acquisition and integration costs , costs related to litigation, advertising, promotional and marketing activities or for sales returns related to any reduction of space by the Company's customers, product discontinuances or otherwise, exceed the anticipated level of expenses, the Company's current sources of funds may be insufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements.\nAny such developments, if significant, could reduce the Company's revenues and operating income and could adversely affect Products Corporation's ability to comply with certain financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreements and in such event the Company could be required to take measures, including, among other things, reducing discretionary spending. (See Item 1A. \"Risk Factors - The Company's ability to service its debt and meet its cash requirements depends on many factors, including achieving anticipated levels of revenue and expenses. If such revenue or expense levels prove to be other than as anticipated, the Company may be unable to meet its cash requirements or Products Corporation may be unable to meet the requirements of the financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations\" and certain other risk factors discussing certain risks associated with the company's business and indebtedness).\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nForeign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts\nProducts Corporation enters into FX Contracts and option contracts from time to time to hedge certain net cash flows denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of the Company's foreign and domestic operations. The FX Contracts are entered into primarily for the purpose of hedging anticipated inventory purchases and certain intercompany payments denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of the Company's foreign and domestic operations and generally have maturities of less than one year. At December 31, 2015, the FX Contracts outstanding had a notional amount of $76.3 million and a net asset fair value of $1.4 million.\nInterest Rate Swap Transaction\nIn November 2013, Products Corporation executed a forward-starting floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction with a 1.00% floor, based on a notional amount of $400 million in respect of indebtedness under the Acquisition Term Loan over a period of three years (the \"2013 Interest Rate Swap\"). The Company designated the 2013 Interest Rate Swap as a cash flow hedge of the variability of the forecasted three-month LIBOR interest rate payments related to the $400 million notional amount under Products Corporation's Acquisition Term Loan over the three-year term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap. Commencing in May 2015, Products Corporation receives from the counterparty a floating interest rate based on the higher of three-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR or 1.00%, while paying a fixed interest rate payment to the counterparty equal to 2.0709% (which effectively fixes the interest rate on such notional amount at 5.0709% over the three-year term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap). For the year ended December 31, 2015, the 2013 Interest Rate Swap was deemed effective and therefore the changes in fair value related to the 2013 Interest Rate Swap have been recorded in Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair value of the Company's 2013 Interest Rate Swap at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was a liability of $6.5 million and $3.5 million, respectively.\nCredit Risk\nExposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of the derivative instruments in asset positions, which totaled $2.0 million and $0.2 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The Company attempts to minimize exposure to credit risk by generally entering into derivative contracts with counterparties that have investment-grade credit ratings and are major financial institutions. The Company also periodically monitors any changes in the credit ratings of its counterparties. Given the current credit standing of the counterparties to the Company's derivative instruments, the Company believes the risk of loss arising from any non-performance by any of the counterparties under these derivative instruments is remote.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nDisclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table aggregates all contractual obligations and commercial commitments that affect the Company's financial condition and liquidity position as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n(dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, including current portion (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,833.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>662.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>640.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>306.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term obligations (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,442.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>283.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>851.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>738.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>569.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Consists primarily of (i) the $662.9 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan as of December 31, 2015; (ii) the $673.7 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Acquisition Term Loan as of December 31, 2015; and (iii) the $500.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 5\u00be% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2015. \n (b) Consists of interest through the respective maturity dates on the outstanding debt discussed in (a) above; based on interest rates under such debt agreements as of December 31, 2015. \n (c) Included in the obligations for operating leases as of December 31, 2015 is the lease for the Company's headquarters in New York City, which includes minimum lease payments in the aggregate of approximately $70 million over the 15-year term. \n (d) Consists of purchase commitments for finished goods, raw materials, components and services pursuant to enforceable and legally binding obligations which include all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. \n (e) Consists primarily of media and advertising contracts, pension funding obligations (amount due within one year only, as subsequent pension funding obligation amounts cannot be reasonably estimated since the return on pension assets in future periods, as well as future pension assumptions, are not known), software licensing agreements and obligations related to third-party warehousing and distribution services. Such amounts exclude employment agreements, severance and other immaterial contractual commitments, which severance and other contractual commitments related to restructuring activities are discussed in Note 3, Restructuring Charges,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. \nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nThe Company does not maintain any off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nDiscussion of Critical Accounting Policies\nIn the ordinary course of its business, the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Company's most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts:\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical experience and ongoing evaluations of the Company's receivables and evaluations of the risks of payment. The allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against trade receivable balances when they are deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of trade receivables previously reserved are recorded in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss) when received.\nSales Returns:\nThe Company allows customers, primarily within its Consumer segment, to return their unsold products when they meet certain company-established criteria as outlined in the Company's trade terms. The Company regularly reviews and revises, when deemed necessary, the Company's estimates of sales returns based primarily upon historical product returns experience, planned product discontinuances and promotional sales, which would permit customers to return products based upon the Company's trade terms. The Company records estimated sales returns as a reduction to sales and cost of sales, and an increase in accrued liabilities and inventories.\nReturned products, which are recorded as inventories, are valued based upon the amount that the Company expects to realize upon their subsequent disposition. The physical condition and marketability of the returned products are the major factors the Company considers in estimating realizable value. Cost of sales includes the cost of refurbishment of returned products. Actual returns, as well as realized values on returned products, may differ significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the Company's estimates if factors such as product discontinuances, customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company's estimates and expectations and, in the case of actual product returns, if economic conditions differ significantly from the Company's estimates and expectations.\nTrade Support Costs:\nIn order to support the retail trade, the Company has various performance-based arrangements with retailers to reimburse them for all or a portion of their promotional activities related to the Company's products. The Company regularly reviews and revises, when deemed necessary, estimates of costs to the Company for these promotions based on estimates of what has been incurred by the retailers. Actual costs incurred by the Company may differ significantly if factors such as the level and success of the retailers' programs, as well as retailer participation levels, differ from the Company's estimates and expectations.\nInventories:\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is based on standard cost and production variances, which approximates actual cost on the first-in, first-out method. Cost components include direct materials, direct labor and direct overhead, as well as in-bound freight. The Company records adjustments to the value of inventory based upon its forecasted plans to sell its inventories, as well as planned discontinuances. The physical condition (e.g., age and quality) of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation. These adjustments are estimates, which could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the amounts that the Company may ultimately realize upon the disposition of inventories if future economic conditions, customer inventory levels, product discontinuances, sales return levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company's estimates and expectations.\nPension Benefits:\nThe Company sponsors both funded and unfunded pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering employees who meet the applicable eligibility requirements. The Company uses several statistical and other factors in an attempt to estimate future events in calculating the liability and net periodic benefit income/cost related to these plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected long-term return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined annually by the Company, within certain guidelines, which assumptions would be subject to revisions if significant events occur during the year. The Company uses December 31st as its measurement date for defined benefit pension plan obligations and plan assets.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company adopted an alternative approach to calculating the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other post-retirement benefits, the full yield curve\u201d approach. Under this method, the discount rate assumption was built through the application of specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for each of the Company's pension and other retirement plans. Prior to December 31, 2015, the Company estimated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. This change does not affect the measurement of the Company's total benefit obligations, as the change in service and interest costs is exactly offset in the actuarial loss (gain) recognized for each year. The Company made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. The change has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle, and accordingly, has been accounted for prospectively.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nThe Company utilized a 4.15% weighted average discount rate in 2015 for the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans, compared to a 3.89% weighted average discount rate in 2014. The Company utilized a 3.68% weighted average discount rate for the Company's international defined benefit pension plans in 2015, compared to a 3.74% weighted average discount rate selected in 2014. The discount rates are used to measure the benefit obligations at the measurement date and the net periodic benefit income/cost for the subsequent calendar year and are reset annually using data available at the measurement date. The changes in the discount rates used for 2015 were primarily due to observed increases in long-term interest yields on high-quality corporate bonds from 2014. At December 31, 2015, the increase in the discount rates from December 31, 2014 had the effect of decreasing the Company's projected pension benefit obligation by approximately $15 million.\nIn selecting its expected long-term rate of return on its plan assets, the Company considers a number of factors, including, without limitation, recent and historical performance of plan assets, the plan portfolios' asset allocations over a variety of time periods compared with third-party studies, the performance of the capital markets in recent years and other factors, as well as advice from various third parties, such as the plans' advisors, investment managers and actuaries. While the Company considered both the recent performance and the historical performance of plan assets, the Company's assumptions are based primarily on its estimates of long-term, prospective rates of return. The difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Those gains or losses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods. For the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the expected long-term rate of return on the pension plan assets used was 7.50% for 2015 and 7.75% for 2014. The weighted average expected long-term rate of return used for the Company's international plans was 6.00% for both 2015 and 2014. For 2015, the Company's pension plans assets realized a loss of $13.9 million, as compared with expected return on assets of $40.3 million. The resulting net deferred loss of $54.2 million, when combined with gains and losses from previous years, will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 10 to 30 years. The actual return on plan assets was below expectations, primarily due to lower returns in developed equity markets and bond yields.\nThe table below reflects the Company's estimates of the possible effects that changes in the discount rates and expected long-term rates of return would have had on its 2015 net periodic benefit costs and its projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2015 for the Company's principal defined benefit pension plans, with all other assumptions remaining constant:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25 basis points increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25 basis points decrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net periodic benefit costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Projected pension benefit obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net periodic benefit costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Projected pension benefit obligation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected long-term rate of return\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe rate of future compensation increases is another assumption used by the Company's third party actuarial consultants for pension accounting. The rate of future compensation increases used for the Company's projected pension benefit obligation in 2015 was 3.50%, as compared to 3.00% in 2014 for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Such increase was not applied to the Revlon Employees' Retirement Plan and the Revlon Pension Equalization Plan, as the rate of future compensation increases is no longer relevant to such plans due to plan amendments which effectively froze these plans as of December 31, 2009.\nIn addition, the Company's actuarial consultants also use other factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants, among other things. Differences from these assumptions could significantly impact the actual amount of net periodic benefit cost and liability recorded by the Company.\nTo determine the fiscal 2016 net periodic benefit income/cost, the Company is using the \"full yield curve approach\" described above to separately calculate discount rates for each of the service and interest components. The following table represents the weighted average discount rates used in calculating each component of service and interest costs for the Company's U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans:\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U.S.\nPlans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>International\nPlans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest cost on projected benefit obligation\n</td> <td>3.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service cost\n</td> <td>4.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest cost on service cost\n</td> <td>4.32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nFor 2016, the Company is using long-term rates of return on pension plan assets of 7.00% and 6.00% for its U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans, respectively. The Company expects that the impact in 2016 of the change in calculating the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other post-retirement benefits following the adoption of the full yield curve approach as discussed above will result in net periodic benefit income of approximately $5.1 million for 2016. The Company expects that the impact of the changes in discount rates and the return on plan assets in 2016 will result in net periodic benefit expense of $3.4 million for 2016, compared to $1.9 million of net periodic benefit income in 2015.\nGoodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets:\nIn determining the fair values of net assets acquired, including trade names, customer relationships and other intangible assets, and resulting goodwill related to the Company's business acquisitions, the Company considers, among other factors, the analyses of historical financial performance and an estimate of the future performance of the acquired business. The fair values of the acquired intangible assets are primarily calculated using a discounted cash flow approach.\nDetermining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations. There are significant judgments inherent in a discounted cash flow approach, including, the selection of appropriate discount rates, hypothetical royalty rates, contributory asset capital charges, estimating the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and identification of appropriate terminal growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in discounted cash flow analyses are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the respective acquired intangible assets.\nDetermining an acquired intangible asset's useful life requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including the expected use of the asset, consumer awareness, trade name history and future expansion expectations, as well as any contractual provisions that could limit or extend an asset's useful life. The Company believes that an acquired trade name has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and the Company has the intent and ability to support the trade name with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If this indefinite-lived criteria is not met, acquired trade names are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from five to 20 years.\nGoodwill totaled $469.7 million and $464.1 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the goodwill of $210.1 million, $240.7 million and $18.9 million related to the Consumer, Professional and Other segments, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangibles totaled $95.0 million and $101.3 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but rather are reviewed annually for impairment using September 30th carrying values, or when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current carrying amounts may not be recovered. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to any such excess. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company establishes its reporting units based on its current reporting structure, product characteristics and management. Within the Consumer segment, the Company has identified two reporting units: (i) \"Global Color Brands,\" which include the SinfulColors and Pure Ice nail enamel brands; and (ii) \"Revlon, Almay and Other,\" which includes the remainder of the Company's Consumer brands and does not include brands of the Company's Other reportable segment. The Company's other reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 18, Segment Data and Related Information.\u201d For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to each reporting unit to the extent that goodwill relates to each reporting unit.\nFor 2015, the Company utilized the two-step process as prescribed by ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, in order to identify potential impairment for each of its reporting units. In the first step of this test, the Company compared the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units, determined based upon discounted estimated future cash flows, to the respective carrying amount, including goodwill. Where the fair value of such reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount, no further work was required and no impairment loss was recognized. The results of the step one test indicated that impairment indicators may have existed for the Company's Global Color Brands reporting unit as a result of the observed decline in sales of the Pure Ice nail enamel brand, primarily driven by the effects of declines in the promotional activity for the Pure Ice brand at retailers, and accordingly, the Company performed step two of the goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit.\nIn the second step, the Company measured the potential impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the Global Color Brands reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill at September 30, 2015. The implied fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination, where the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was allocated to all the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit (including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid. When the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of that reporting unit's goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized within operations. The Company determined the fair value of the Global Color Brands reporting unit using discounted estimated future cash flows. The weighted average cost of capital in testing the Global Color Brands reporting unit for impairment was 13.0% with a perpetual growth rate of 2.0%. As a result of this annual impairment test, the Company recognized a $9.7 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nthe Global Color Brands reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2015. Following the recognition of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge, the Global Color Brands reporting unit has remaining goodwill in the amount of $25.6 million at December 31, 2015.\nAs of the date of the latest impairment test, the fair values of the (i) Revlon, Almay and Other; (ii) Professional; and (iii) Other reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately $2.5 billion, $310.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively. The Company did not record any impairment of identified intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFor 2014 and 2013, the Company performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it would be necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test and to assess the Company's indefinite lived intangible assets for indicators of impairment, and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying amounts. The Company did not record any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2013.\nSee Note 2, Business Combinations\u201d and Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net\u201d for further discussion of the Company's goodwill and intangible assets.\nIncome Taxes:\nThe Company records income taxes based on amounts payable with respect to the current year and includes the effect of deferred taxes. The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax-planning opportunities that may be available in various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, and the Company's estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Determining the Company's effective tax rate and evaluating tax positions requires significant judgment.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which management expects that the Company will recover or settle those differences. The realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on forecasted future taxable income. The Company has established valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize a tax benefit. Any reduction in estimated forecasted future taxable income may require the Company to record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance was not previously established. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Provision for income taxes,\u201d for further discussion.\nThe Company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the merits of such position. The Company recognizes liabilities for unrecognized tax positions in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts is ultimately not required, the reversal of the liabilities would result in additional tax benefits recognized in the period in which the Company determines that the liabilities are no longer required. If the estimate of tax liabilities is ultimately less than the final assessment, this will result in a further charge to expense. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.\nThe Company provides for U.S. federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on foreign subsidiaries' cumulative undistributed earnings when it is not the Company's intent to indefinitely reinvest such earnings overseas. No provision is made for U.S. income taxes where the Company's plan is to indefinitely reinvest such undistributed earnings from the Company's foreign operations in its overseas operations. If these future foreign earnings are repatriated to the U.S., or if the Company determines that such foreign earnings will be remitted to the U.S. in the foreseeable future, additional U.S. tax provisions may be required.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-08, \"Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity,\" which changes the requirements for reporting discontinued operations under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 205. Under ASU No. 2014-08, a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. The standard states that a strategic shift could include a disposal of: (i) a major geographical area of operations; (ii) a major line of business; (iii) a major equity method investment; or (iv) other major parts of an entity. ASU No. 2014-08 no longer precludes presentation as a discontinued operation if: (i) there are operations and cash flows of the component that have not been eliminated from the reporting entity's ongoing operations; or (ii) there is significant continuing involvement with a component after its disposal. Additional disclosures about discontinued operations will also be required. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and is to be applied prospectively to new disposals and new classifications of disposal groups as held for sale after the effective date. The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-08 on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2015, and such adoption did not have an impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or financial statement disclosures.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards or Updates Not Yet Effective\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,\" which requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent within a company's balance sheet. Currently, the Company is required to separate deferred income tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts on its classified balance sheet, and this update will simplify the presentation by requiring a single, noncurrent amount. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-17 beginning on January 1, 2016 and the adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, \"Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments,\" which eliminates the current requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-16 beginning on January 1, 2016 and the adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, \"Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,\" which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by requiring inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value, rather than at the lower of cost or market. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt ASU No. 2015-11 beginning on January 1, 2017. The Company is evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and financial statement disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, \"Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\" which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the financial statements as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied retrospectively. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03 beginning on January 1, 2016 and the adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in the ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The core principle of ASU No. 2014-09 is for companies to recognize revenue from the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 also will result in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provide guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively (for example, service revenue and contract modifications) and improve guidance for multiple-element arrangements. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption prohibited. The Company expects to adopt ASU No. 2014-09 beginning January 1, 2018 and is in the process of assessing the impact that the new guidance will have on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and financial statement disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, \"Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,\" that will explicitly require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures if conditions give rise to substantial doubt. According to ASU No. 2014-15, substantial doubt exists if it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations within one year after the issuance date. The likelihood threshold of \"probable,\" similar to its current use in U.S. GAAP for loss contingencies, will be used to define substantial doubt. Disclosures will be required under ASU No. 2014-15 if conditions give rise to substantial doubt including whether and how management's plans will alleviate the substantial doubt. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption prohibited. The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-15 beginning January 1, 2016 and the adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.\nInflation\nThe Company's costs are affected by inflation and the effects of inflation that the Company may experience in future periods.

Perelman.\nThe Company's vision is to establish Revlon as the quintessential and most innovative beauty company in the world by offering products that make consumers feel attractive and beautiful. We want to inspire our consumers to express themselves boldly and confidently. The Company operates in three segments: the consumer division ( Consumer\u201d); the professional division ( Professional\u201d); and Other (as described below). The Company manufactures, markets and sells an extensive array of beauty and personal care products worldwide, including color cosmetics, hair color, hair care and hair treatments, beauty tools, men's grooming products, anti-perspirant deodorants, fragrances, skincare and other beauty care products.\nFor additional information regarding our business, see \"Part 1, Item 1 - Business\" in this Form 10-K.\nDiscontinued Operations Presentation\nAs a result of the Company's decision on December 30, 2013 to exit its direct manufacturing, warehousing and sales business operations in mainland China, effective December 31, 2013, the Company is reporting the results of its former China operations within income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. Unless otherwise stated, financial results discussed within \"Overview\" and \"Results of Operations\" refer only to continuing operations. See Note 4, \"Discontinued Operations\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nOverview of Net Sales and Earnings Results\nConsolidated net sales in 2015 were $1,914.3 million, a decrease of $26.7 million, or 1.4%, compared to $1,941.0 million in 2014. Excluding the $121.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, consolidated net sales increased $94.5 million, or 4.9%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by an increase in Consumer segment net sales of $53.9 million, or 3.7%, and the inclusion of $28.4 million of net sales as a result of the CBB Acquisition.\nConsolidated income from continuing operations, net of taxes, in 2015 was $65.3 million, compared to consolidated income from continuing operations, net of taxes, of $46.0 million in 2014. The $19.3 million increase in 2015 was primarily due to:\n \u2022 a $26.4 million decrease in the provision for income taxes in 2015, primarily due to the favorable impact as a result of the net reduction of the Company's deferred tax valuation allowance on the Company's net deferred tax assets for certain foreign jurisdictions; \nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\n \u2022 $10.5 million in restructuring charges and other, net, in 2015, which primarily includes $9.5 million in restructuring charges recognized in 2015 related to the 2015 Efficiency Program, as compared to $21.3 million of restructuring charges and other, net recognized in 2014, primarily due to the Integration Program; \n \u2022 $9.3 million of favorable variance in foreign currency (gains) losses, net, as a result of $15.7 million in foreign currency losses, net, recognized during 2015, compared to $25.0 million in foreign currency losses, net, recognized during 2014; and \n \u2022 a $6.2 million reduction in SG&A expenses, primarily driven by the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which was partially offset by higher brand support within both the Consumer and Professional segments and increases in general and administrative expenses primarily due to $10.2 million of the 2015 pension lump sum settlement charge that was recorded as a component of SG&A expenses, as well as higher severance costs and incentive compensation;  with the foregoing partially offset by:\n \u2022 $26.2 million of lower gross profit in 2015 primarily due to a $26.7 million decrease in consolidated net sales, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the unfavorable impact of a $10.5 million portion of the 2015 pension lump sum settlement charge in 2015 recorded within cost of sales; and \n \u2022 a $9.7 million non-cash impairment loss on goodwill for the Company's Global Color Brands reporting unit.  These items are discussed in more detail within \"Results of Operations\" and within \"Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below.\nRecent Events\n2015 Efficiency Program\nIn September 2015, the Company initiated the 2015 Efficiency Program, consisting of restructuring actions to drive certain organizational efficiencies across the Company's Consumer and Professional segments. These actions are designed to reduce general and administrative expenses within the Consumer and Professional segments, and the Company expects that they will be completed by the end of 2017. The Company recognized $9.5 million of restructuring and related charges in 2015 for the 2015 Efficiency Program, of which $6.0 million related to the Consumer segment and $3.2 million related to the Professional segment, with the remaining charges included within unallocated corporate expenses, and expects to recognize total restructuring and related charges of $10.1 million by the end of 2017. By implementing the 2015 Efficiency Program, the Company expects to achieve annualized cost reductions of approximately $10.0 million to $15.0 million by the end of 2018, with approximately $3.0 million of cost reductions included in 2015 results.\nIn connection with the restructuring actions initiated in 2015 for the 2015 Efficiency Program, the Company expects to pay cash in an amount of approximately $10.3 million, including $0.2 million for capital expenditures (which capital expenditures are excluded from total restructuring and related charges expected to be recognized for the 2015 Efficiency Program), of which $2.8 million was paid in 2015, $5.8 million is expected to be paid in 2016, and the remaining balance is expected to be paid in 2017.\nSee Note 3, \"Restructuring Charges,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details.\nAcquisition of CBBeauty Group\nOn the CBB Acquisition Date, the Company completed the CBB Acquisition for total cash consideration of $48.6 million. CBB develops, manufactures, markets and distributes fragrances and other beauty products under various celebrity, lifestyle and fashion brands licensed from third parties, principally through department stores and selective distribution in international territories. CBB is expected to provide the Company with a platform to develop the Company's presence in the fragrance category. On the CBB Acquisition Date, the Company used cash on hand to pay 70% of the total cash consideration, or $34.6 million. The remaining $14.0 million of the total cash consideration is payable in equal installments over four years from the CBB Acquisition Date, subject to the selling shareholders' compliance with certain service conditions. These remaining installments are being recorded as a component of SG&A expenses ratably over the four year installment period. The results of operations of the CBB business were included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements commencing on the CBB Acquisition Date. See Note 2, \"Business Combinations,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details on the CBB Acquisition.\nPension Lump Sum Settlement Charge\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company offered certain former employees who had vested benefits in the Company's U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (the Revlon Employees' Retirement Plan) the option of receiving the present value of the participant's pension benefit in a one-time cash lump sum payment. Based on the participants' acceptance of that offer, $53.4\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nmillion was paid from the plan's assets to settle $66.9 million of pension liabilities, resulting in a $13.5 million net reduction of the Company's pension plan liabilities in 2015. In addition, the Company recorded a charge of $20.7 million as a result of the pension lump sum settlement accounting within costs of sales and SG&A expense in 2015. This charge was the result of accelerating a portion of the losses that were deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which are required to be recognized in the period in which the pension plan liabilities were settled. See Note 14, \"Savings Plan, Pension and Post-retirement Benefits,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details on this pension lump sum settlement.\nNon-cash Impairment Charge\nFor purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company's Pure Ice nail enamel brand, which was acquired in July 2012, is included within the Company's Global Color Brands reporting unit. Despite improvements in the net sales of Pure Ice nail enamel in 2015 and the realization of margin improvements through integrating the production of Pure Ice nail enamel within the Company's existing manufacturing processes, the Company continued to experience declines in the promotional activity for the Pure Ice brand at retailers. As a result, in conjunction with the Company's annual goodwill impairment test, the Company recorded a $9.7 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge during the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the Company's expectations regarding the future performance of the Global Color Brands reporting unit in relation to its carrying amount. See Note 8, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details on this non-cash goodwill impairment charge.\n2015 Debt Related Transaction\nIn March 2015, Products Corporation prepaid $24.6 million of term loan indebtedness, representing 50% of its 2014 \"excess cash flow\" in accordance with the terms of its Amended Term Loan Agreement. The prepayment was applied on a ratable basis between the principal amounts outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan and the Acquisition Term Loan. The amount of the prepayment that was applied to the 2011 Term Loan reduced the principal amount outstanding by $12.1 million to $662.9 million (as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan had been paid). The $12.5 million applied to the Acquisition Term Loan reduced Products Corporation's future regularly scheduled quarterly amortization payments under the Acquisition Term Loan on a ratable basis from $1.8 million prior to the prepayment to $1.7 million after giving effect to the prepayment and through its maturity on October 8, 2019. See Note 11, \"Long-Term Debt,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details.\nOperating Segments\nThe Company primarily operates in three segments: the Consumer segment, the Professional segment and the Other segment:\n \u2022 The Consumer segment is comprised of the Company's consumer brands, which primarily include Revlon, Almay, SinfulColors and Pure Ice in color cosmetics; Revlon ColorSilk in women's hair color; Revlon in beauty tools; and Mitchum in anti-perspirant deodorants. The Company's principal customers for its consumer products include large volume retailers, chain drug and food stores, chemist shops, hypermarkets, general merchandise stores, the Internet/e-commerce, television shopping, department stores, one-stop shopping beauty retailers, specialty cosmetics stores and perfumeries in the U.S. and internationally. The Consumer segment also includes a skincare line and a hair color line sold to large volume retailers and other retailers, primarily in Spain. \n \u2022 The Professional segment is comprised primarily of the Company's professional brands, which include Revlon Professional in hair color and hair care; CND-branded products in nail polishes and nail enhancements; and American Crew in men's grooming products, all of which are sold worldwide to professional salons. The Company's principal customers for its professional products include hair and nail salons and distributors to professional salons in the U.S. and internationally. The Professional segment also includes a multi-cultural hair care line consisting of Creme of Nature hair care products sold to professional salons, large volume retailers and other retailers, primarily in the U.S. \n \u2022 The Other segment primarily includes the operating results of the CBB business and related purchase accounting for the CBB Acquisition. CBB develops, manufactures, markets and distributes fragrances and other beauty products under various celebrity, lifestyle and fashion brands licensed from third parties, principally through department stores and selective distribution in international territories. The results included within the Other segment are not material to the Company's consolidated results of operations. \nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nResults of Operations\nIn the tables below, all amounts are in millions and numbers in parentheses ( ) denote unfavorable variances.\nConsolidated Net Sales:\nConsolidated net sales in 2015 were $1,914.3 million, a decrease of $26.7 million, or 1.4%, compared to $1,941.0 million in 2014. Excluding the $121.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, consolidated net sales increased $94.5 million, or 4.9%, during 2015, primarily driven by an increase in Consumer segment net sales of $53.9 million, or 3.7%, and the inclusion of $28.4 million of net sales as a result of the CBB Acquisition.\nConsolidated net sales in 2014 were $1,941.0 million, an increase of $446.3 million, or 29.9% as compared to $1,494.7 million in 2013. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations of $60.1 million, consolidated net sales increased $506.4 million, or 33.9% during 2014, primarily driven by the increase in net sales of $460.9 million as a result of the Colomer Acquisition in October 2013.\nSee \"Segment Results\" below for further discussion.\nSegment Results:\nThe Company's management evaluates segment profit, which is defined as income from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gains/losses on foreign currency fluctuations, gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt and miscellaneous expenses, for each of the Company's reportable segments. Segment profit also excludes unallocated corporate expenses and the impact of certain items that are not directly attributable to the segments' underlying operating performance, which includes the impact of: (i) restructuring and related charges; (ii) acquisition and integration costs; (iii) goodwill impairment charges; (iv) pension lump sum settlement charge; (v) costs of sales resulting from fair value adjustments to inventory acquired in acquisitions; (vi) deferred compensation related to the CBB Acquisition; (vii) insurance proceeds received in 2013 related to the 2011 fire that destroyed the Company's facility in Venezuela; and (viii) an accrual for estimated clean-up costs related to the Company's facility in Venezuela. Unallocated corporate expenses primarily include general and administrative expenses related to the corporate organization. These expenses are recorded in unallocated corporate expenses as these items are centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company removed pension-related costs for its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans from the measurement of its operating segment results. As a result, $8.2 million and $4.9 million of pension-related costs were reclassified from the measurement of Consumer segment profit and included as a component of unallocated corporate expenses for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company does not have any material inter-segment sales. For a reconciliation of segment profit to income from continuing operations before income taxes, see Note 18, \"Segment Data and Related Information\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe following tables provide a comparative summary of the Company's segment results for each of 2015, 2014 and 2013. In the tables below, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. Consumer segment net sales and segment profit include the results of retail brands acquired in the Colomer Acquisition, which had previously been included in the Professional segment.\n\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\n\n(a) XFX excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nConsumer Segment\nConsumer segment net sales in 2015 were $1,414.8 million, a decrease of $23.5 million, or 1.6%, compared to $1,438.3 million in 2014. Excluding the $77.4 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations (referred to herein as on an \"XFX basis\"), total Consumer net sales increased $53.9 million, or 3.7%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products, Revlon ColorSilk hair color and Cutex nail products, partially offset by lower net sales of Almay color cosmetics. Consumer segment net sales were negatively impacted in connection with the Company's exit of its business operations in Venezuela in the second quarter of 2015 and change to a distributor model, as such change resulted in $1.0 million of net sales in Venezuela in 2015, compared to $16.3 million of net sales in Venezuela in 2014. Excluding Venezuela, on an XFX basis, Consumer net sales would have increased by 4.4% in 2015, compared to 2014.\nConsumer segment profit in 2015 was $360.2 million, an increase of $20.8 million, or 6.1%, compared to $339.4 million in 2014. Excluding the $9.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, Consumer segment profit increased $30.0 million, or 8.8%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher gross profit as a result of the increases in net sales discussed above, partially offset by $8.7 million of higher brand support expenses for the Company's Consumer brands. In connection with the Company's exit of its business operations in Venezuela in the second quarter of 2015 and change to a distributor model, there was no profit in Venezuela in 2015, compared to $6.6 million of profit in Venezuela in 2014. Excluding Venezuela, on an XFX basis, Consumer segment profit would have increased by 11.1% in 2015, compared to 2014.\nConsumer segment net sales in 2014 were $1,438.3 million, an increase of $44.1 million, or 3.2%, compared to $1,394.2 million in 2013. Excluding the $54.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, total Consumer net sales increased $98.3 million, or 7.1%, in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily driven by: (i) the inclusion of $52.8 million of increased net sales from Consumer brands acquired in the Colomer Acquisition; (ii) $15.1 million of favorable sales returns reserve adjustments in the U.S. during 2014, as a result of lower expected discontinued products in the future related to the Company's strategy to focus on fewer, bigger and better innovations, partially offset by increased sales returns expense for 2014 sales returns; and (iii) higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, Revlon ColorSilk hair color and Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products. The increases in Consumer segment net sales in 2014 were partially offset by lower net sales of fragrances, as well as lower net sales of Almay, SinfulColors and Pure Ice color cosmetics.\nConsumer segment profit in 2014 was $339.4 million, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 0.8%, compared to $342.3 million in 2013, primarily due to lower gross profit as a result of $33.0 million of higher advertising expense to support the Company's Consumer brands, and approximately $17.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by the increase in net sales, including the $15.1 million of favorable sales returns reserve adjustments.\nProfessional Segment\nProfessional segment net sales in 2015 were $471.1 million, a decrease of $31.6 million, or 6.3%, compared to $502.7 million in 2014. Excluding the $43.8 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, total Professional net sales increased $12.2 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of higher net sales of American Crew men's grooming products, Revlon Professional hair products and Creme of Nature hair products, partially offset by lower net sales of CND nail products in the U.S.\nProfessional segment profit in 2015 was $103.9 million, a decrease of $0.9 million, or 0.9%, compared to $104.8 million in 2014. Excluding the $3.7 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, Professional segment profit increased $2.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to higher net sales, partially offset by $5.1 million of higher brand support\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nexpenses for the Company's Professional brands. In addition, Professional segment profit in 2014 included a favorable adjustment of $3.4 million related to the inventory obsolescence reserve, with no similar adjustment in 2015.\nThe Company's Professional segment is comprised of most of the operations acquired by the Company in the Colomer Acquisition in October 2013 (with the exception of the retail brands acquired in the Colomer Acquisition, which the Company has included within the Consumer segment, as noted above). As Colomer was acquired in October 2013, there are no full year comparable prior years' net sales or segment profit for the Professional segment to facilitate a comparison of 2014 and 2013 Professional segment results. Therefore, an analysis of net sales and segment profit for the Professional segment in 2014, compared to 2013, is not included in this Form 10-K. Professional net sales were $502.7 million for the full year of 2014 and $100.5 million from the October 2013 Colomer Acquisition Date through the end of 2013. Professional net sales during each period consisted primarily of the net sales of CND products worldwide, including CND Shellac; Revlon Professional products, primarily in Europe; and American Crew products and other professional brands world-wide.\nProfessional segment profit was $104.8 million for the full year of 2014 and $5.1 million from the October 2013 Colomer Acquisition Date through the end of 2013 and is comprised of the operating results of substantially all of the operations acquired in the Colomer Acquisition.\nGeographic Results:\nIn connection with changes that the organization made to its management reporting structure following the Colomer Acquisition, beginning in 2014, the Company combined its former Latin America and Canada; Asia Pacific; and Europe, Middle East and Africa operating regions into the International region for reporting purposes. The Company has modified its net sales discussion to conform to the manner by which the Company's management reviews the business, and, accordingly, prior year amounts have been restated to conform to this presentation.\nThe following tables provide a comparative summary of the Company's net sales by region for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\n\n\n(a) XFX excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nUnited States\nIn the U.S., net sales in 2015 increased $21.8 million, or 2.1%, to $1,043.7 million, compared to $1,021.9 million in 2014, primarily due to higher Consumer segment net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products and Revlon ColorSilk hair color, partially offset by lower net sales of Almay color cosmetics. Net sales in the U.S. decreased in the Professional segment primarily due to lower net sales of CND nail products.\nIn the U.S., net sales in 2014 increased $189.1 million, or 22.7%, to $1,021.9 million, as compared to $832.8 million in 2013, primarily due to the inclusion of $157.1 million of increased net sales as a result of the Colomer Acquisition. 2014 net sales in the U.S. were also impacted by $15.1 million of favorable sales returns reserve adjustments during 2014, as a result of lower expected discontinued products in the future related to the Company's strategy to focus on fewer, bigger and better innovations, partially offset by increased sales returns expense for 2014 sales returns. In addition, 2014 had higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics, Revlon ColorSilk hair color and Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products, partially offset by lower net sales of Almay, SinfulColors and Pure Ice color cosmetics.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nInternational\nInternational net sales in 2015 decreased by $48.5 million, or 5.3%, to $870.6 million, as compared to $919.1 million in 2014. Excluding the $121.2 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, International net sales increased by $72.7 million, or 7.9%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics in the Consumer segment. International net sales increased in the Professional segment primarily due to higher net sales of American Crew men's grooming products and Revlon Professional hair products. From a geographic perspective, the increase in international net sales was throughout most of the Company's International region. The Company's exit of its business operations in Venezuela in 2015 negatively impacted International net sales. Excluding Venezuela, on an XFX basis, International net sales would have increased by 9.0% in 2015, compared to 2014.\nInternational net sales in 2014 increased $257.2 million, or 38.9%, to $919.1 million, as compared to $661.9 million in 2013. Excluding the $60.1 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, International net sales increased by $317.3 million, or 47.9%, primarily due to the inclusion of $303.8 million of increased net sales as a result of the Colomer Acquisition. Additionally, 2014 net sales were impacted by higher net sales of Revlon color cosmetics in Venezuela and Japan and Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorant products primarily in the U.K., partially offset by lower net sales of Revlon color cosmetics in certain distributor markets and fragrances in the U.K. and Italy. Results in Venezuela for 2014 benefited from the increased availability of U.S. Dollars to import finished goods for sale, as compared to 2013.\nGross profit:\n\nGross profit decreased as a percentage of net sales by 0.5 percentage points, decreasing by $26.2 million in 2015, as compared to 2014. The drivers of the changes in gross profit in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily included:\n \u2022 unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, which reduced gross profit by $90.0 million and reduced gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 0.5 percentage points; \n \u2022 the unfavorable impact of a portion of the 2015 pension lump sum settlement charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 within cost of sales in the amount of $10.5 million, which decreased gross profit by as a percentage of net sales by 0.6 percentage points. \n \u2022 the effects of the favorable sales returns accrual adjustments made in 2015 and 2014, due to lower expected discontinued products in the future related to the Company's strategy to focus on fewer, bigger and better innovations, which 2014 adjustment was $4.1 million more favorable than the 2015 adjustment, and which had no impact on gross profit as a percentage of net sales;  with the foregoing partially offset by:\n \u2022 favorable volume, which increased gross profit by $67.8 million and increased gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 0.2 percentage points; and \n \u2022 lower manufacturing and freight costs as a result of supply chain cost reduction initiatives, which increased gross profit by $9.5 million and increased gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 0.5 percentage points.  Gross profit increased by $323.1 million, and as a percentage of net sales gross profit increased by 2.1 percentage points in 2014, as compared to 2013. The drivers of gross profit in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily included:\n \u2022 the inclusion of gross profit from the Colomer Acquisition beginning in October 2013, which increased gross profit by $314.8 million and increased gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 1.3 percentage points; \n \u2022 favorable sales mix within the Consumer segment, which increased gross profit by $19.3 million and increased gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 1.0 percentage points; \n \u2022 favorable volume, which increased gross profit by $15.2 million, with no impact on gross profit as a percentage of net sales; and \nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\n \u2022 the favorable impact of sales returns accrual adjustments, net of related inventory write-off charges, due to lower expected discontinued products in the future related to the Company's strategy to focus on fewer, bigger and better innovations, which increased gross profit by $12.1 million and increased gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 0.1 percentage points;  with the foregoing partially offset by:\n \u2022 unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, which reduced gross profit by $45.1 million and reduced gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 0.4 percentage points. \nSG&A expenses:\n\nSG&A expenses decreased by $6.2 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by:\n \u2022 $72.2 million of favorable impact due to foreign currency fluctuations in 2015;  with the foregoing partially offset by:\n \u2022 $16.2 million of higher brand support expenses for the Company's brands within the Consumer and Professional segments in 2015; and \n \u2022 $49.3 million of higher general and administrative expenses in 2015, primarily due to:  (i) $14.7 million of severance costs related to a 2015 initiative to upgrade the Company's people and talent; (ii) $10.2 million of charges related to the 2015 pension lump sum settlement recorded as a component of SG&A expenses; (iii) $9.8 million in expenses related to the 2015 operations of the CBB business acquired in April 2015; and (iv) higher incentive compensation expenses.\nIn 2014, as compared to 2013, SG&A expenses increased $276.1 million, primarily driven by:\n \u2022 the inclusion of SG&A expenses as a result of the Colomer Acquisition, beginning in October 2013, which contributed $226.2 million to the increase in SG&A expenses; \n \u2022 $33.0 million of higher advertising expenses to support the Company's brands within the Consumer segment; \n \u2022 a $26.4 million gain from insurance proceeds in 2013 due to the settlement of the Company's claim for the loss of inventory from the fire that destroyed the Company's facility in Venezuela, partially offset by an accrual in 2013 of $7.6 million for estimated clean-up costs related to the destroyed facility, which did not recur in 2014; \n \u2022 $18.3 million of higher general and administrative expenses, primarily due to increased severance related costs, higher incentive and stock-based compensation expense, and higher occupancy costs due to overlapping rents as a result of the Company's relocation of its New York City headquarters during 2014; and \n \u2022 $4.0 million of higher amortization of permanent wall displays;  with the foregoing partially offset by:\n \u2022 $24.8 million of favorable impacts due to foreign currency fluctuations. \nAcquisition and Integration Costs:\n\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nThe acquisition and integration costs for 2015, 2014 and 2013 are summarized in the table presented below.\n\nAcquisition costs in 2015 primarily included legal and consulting fees related to the CBB Acquisition. Acquisition costs in 2014 and 2013 primarily included legal and consulting fees related to the Colomer Acquisition.\nIntegration costs consist of non-restructuring costs related to integrating Colomer's operations into the Company's business. Integration costs incurred during 2015 primarily included legal and professional fees. Integration costs incurred during 2014 primarily included employee-related costs related to management changes and audit-related fees related to the Colomer Acquisition. For 2013, integration costs primarily related to an impairment of in-progress capitalized software development costs, as well as employee-related costs due to management changes, in each case related to the Colomer Acquisition.\nRestructuring charges and other, net:\n\nRestructuring charges and other, net, for 2015 primarily related to $9.5 million of costs incurred in connection with the 2015 Efficiency Program.\nDuring 2014, the Company recorded charges totaling $20.1 million related to restructuring and related actions under the Integration Program, of which $18.9 million was recorded in restructuring charges and other, net, $0.6 million was recorded in cost of sales and $0.6 million was recorded in SG&A expenses.\nSee Note 3, \"Restructuring Charges\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nInterest expense:\n\nThe $1.1 million decrease in interest expense in 2015, compared to 2014, was primarily due to lower average debt outstanding, partially offset by higher weighted average borrowing rates. The lower average debt outstanding was the result of: (i) regularly scheduled quarterly amortization payments made towards the Acquisition Term Loan through December 31, 2015; (ii) the favorable benefit to 2015 as a result of the May 1, 2014 prepayment of the remaining $58.4 million principal amount outstanding under the Non-Contributed Loan; and (iii) the $24.6 million March 2015 excess cash flow prepayment, of which $12.1 million was applied to the principal amount outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan. The remaining $12.5 million of the excess cash flow prepayment that was applied to the Acquisition Term Loan reduced Products Corporation's future regularly scheduled quarterly amortization payments under the Acquisition Term Loan on a ratable basis from $1.8 million prior to such prepayment to $1.7 million after giving effect to such prepayment and through its maturity on October 8, 2019. The higher weighted average borrowing rates were primarily due to the impact of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap going into effect in May 2015.\nThe $5.8 million increase in interest expense in 2014, as compared to 2013, was primarily due to higher average debt as a result of Products Corporation's Acquisition Term Loan that was used to fund the Colomer Acquisition, partially offset by lower weighted average borrowing rates.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nForeign currency losses, net:\n\nThe decrease in foreign currency losses, net, of $9.3 million during 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily driven by:\n \u2022 a $6.0 million foreign currency loss recognized in 2014 as a result of the re-measurement of Revlon Venezuela's balance sheet, as compared to a $1.9 million foreign currency loss recognized in 2015; \n \u2022 a $3.8 million gain in 2015, compared to a $0.5 million gain in 2014, related to the Company's foreign currency forward exchange contracts; and \n \u2022 the favorable impact of the revaluation of certain U.S. Dollar and foreign currency denominated intercompany payables during 2015, as compared to 2014.  The increase in foreign currency losses, net, of $21.3 million during 2014, as compared to 2013, was primarily driven by:\n \u2022 the unfavorable impact of the revaluation of certain U.S. Dollar denominated intercompany payables during 2014, as compared to 2013; and \n \u2022 a $6.0 million foreign currency loss related to the required re-measurement of Revlon Venezuela's balance sheet during the second quarter of 2014. \nProvision for income taxes:\n\nThe provision for income taxes decreased by $26.8 million in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to the favorable impact of certain discrete items, including: (i) the net reduction of valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions; (ii) lower pre-tax income in certain jurisdictions for 2015, compared to 2014; (iii) the impact of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in 2015; and (iv) the impact of certain tax matters in 2014 that did not recur in 2015.\nThe provision for income taxes increased by $32.6 million in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to: (i) the loss on early extinguishment of debt recognized in 2013; (ii) certain expenses related to the Colomer Acquisition; (iii) the favorable resolution of tax matters in a foreign jurisdiction; (iv) increased pre-tax income; and (v) establishing a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets in the Professional segment in 2014 (each of which in the case of (i), (ii) and (iii) favorably affected the provision for income taxes in 2013 and each of which did not recur in 2014), partially offset by the favorable impact of certain discrete items in 2014, including the favorable resolution of tax matters in certain jurisdictions and return-to-provision adjustments.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for 2015 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35% due principally to: (i) foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to operations outside the U.S.; (ii) state and local taxes; and (iii) foreign dividends and earnings taxable in the U.S., partially offset by the net reduction of valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for 2014 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35% due principally to: (i) state and local taxes, net of U.S federal income tax benefit; (ii) establishing a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets in the Professional segment; (iii) foreign dividends and earnings taxable in the U.S.; and (iv) foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to operations outside the U.S.\nThe Company expects that its tax provision and effective tax rate in any individual quarter and year-to-date period will vary and may not be indicative of the Company's tax provision and effective tax rate for the full year.\nIn assessing the recoverability of its deferred tax assets, management regularly considers whether some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized based on the recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is generally dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\ntaxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. See Note 16, Income Taxes,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had a liquidity position of $473.6 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents (net of any outstanding checks) of $307.4 million, as well as $166.2 million in available borrowings under Products Corporation's $175.0 million Amended Revolving Credit Facility, based upon the borrowing base less $8.8 million of undrawn outstanding letters of credit and no other borrowing outstanding under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility at such date.\nThe Company's foreign operations held $97.3 million out of the total $307.4 million in cash and cash equivalents (net of any outstanding checks) as of December 31, 2015. The cash held by the Company's foreign operations is primarily used to fund such operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources of cash to fund these needs. As part of this assessment, the Company determines the amount of foreign earnings, if any, that it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs, including for the Company's debt service obligations, and pays applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes, if any, on such earnings to the extent repatriated, and otherwise records a tax liability for the estimated cost of repatriation in a future period. The Company believes that the cash generated by its domestic operations and availability under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility and other permitted lines of credit should be sufficient to meet its domestic liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. Therefore, the Company currently anticipates that restrictions and/or taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings will not have a material effect on the Company's liquidity during such period.\nChanges in Cash Flows\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $326.9 million, compared with $275.3 million at December 31, 2014. The following table summarizes the Company's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities in 2015, 2014 and 2013:\n\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $155.3 million, $174.0 million and $123.3 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in cash from operating activities in 2015, compared to the 2014, was primarily driven by higher inventory and tax payments, partially offset by less cash used in discontinued operations, as well as lower payments for restructuring and interest in 2015 compared to 2014. The cash provided by operating activities in 2014, compared to 2013, was favorably impacted by cash provided by the operations of the Professional segment, as a result of the Colomer Acquisition, partially offset by higher interest payments and unfavorable changes in working capital, including higher tax payments and higher payments for restructuring actions primarily related to both the Integration Program and the restructuring actions that included exiting the Company's direct manufacturing, warehousing and sales business operations in mainland China, as well as implementing other immaterial restructuring actions outside the U.S. that are expected to generate other operating efficiencies (the \"December 2013 Program\").\nSee Note 3, \"Restructuring Charges\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion related to the Company's restructuring programs.\nNet cash provided by operating activities related to discontinued operations, including restructuring payments, was approximately $0.1 million, $27 million and $10 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $83.8 million, $52.1 million and $639.4 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2015 included:\n \u2022 $48.3 million of cash used for capital expenditures; and \n \u2022 $41.7 million in cash payments, net of cash acquired, primarily for the CBB Acquisition, partially offset by $6.2 million in cash proceeds from the sale of certain immaterial, non-core assets.  Net cash used in investing activities for 2014 included:\n \u2022 $55.5 million of cash used for capital expenditures, which were partially offset by $3.4 million in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, primarily related to other immaterial restructuring actions.  Net cash used in investing activities for 2013 included:\n \u2022 a cash payment of $664.5 million for the Colomer Acquisition, offset by $36.9 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired in such transaction, for a net cash use of $627.6 million; and \n \u2022 $28.6 million of cash used for capital expenditures;  with the foregoing partially offset by:\n \u2022 $13.1 million of insurance proceeds received in July 2013 for the Company's property claim related to the June 2011 fire at the Company's facility in Venezuela.  Financing Activities\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $(12.1) million, $(75.1) million and $649.0 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2015 primarily included:\n \u2022 a $24.6 million required excess cash flow prepayment made under the Amended Term Loan Facility; and \n \u2022 $6.8 million of scheduled amortization payments on the Acquisition Term Loan;  with the foregoing partially offset by:\n \u2022 $23.0 million increase in short-term borrowings and overdraft.  Net cash used in financing activities for 2014 included:\n \u2022 the repayment in May 2014 of the $58.4 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Non-Contributed Loan; \n \u2022 $7.0 million of scheduled amortization payments on the Acquisition Term Loan; \n \u2022 $4.7 million decrease in short-term borrowings and overdraft; and \n \u2022 the payment of $1.8 million of financing costs primarily related to the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment (as hereinafter defined).  Net cash provided by financing activities for 2013 included:\n \u2022 Cash proceeds received in connection with the Acquisition Term Loan, in the aggregate principal amount of $700.0 million, or $698.3 million, net of discounts; and \n \u2022 Products Corporation's issuance of the $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes at par;  with the foregoing partially offset by:\n \u2022 the repayment and redemption of all of the $330.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of Products Corporation's previous 9\u00be% Senior Secured Notes in connection with the 2013 Senior Notes Refinancing; \n \u2022 the repayment of $113.0 million in principal on the 2011 Term Loan in connection with the consummation of the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments (as hereinafter defined); and \n \u2022 the payment of $48.8 million of financing costs comprised of: (i) $17.5 million of redemption and tender offer premiums, as well as fees and expenses related to the repayment and redemption of all of the $330.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 9\u00be% Senior Secured Notes in connection with the 2013 Senior Notes Refinancing; (ii) $10.2 million of underwriters' fees and other fees in connection with the issuance of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes in connection with the 2013 Senior Notes Refinancing; (iii) $1.2 million of fees incurred in connection with the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments; (iv) $3.5 million of fees incurred in connection with the August 2013 Term Loan Amendments (as hereinafter defined); (v) $15.9 million of fees incurred in connection with the Incremental Amendment (as hereinafter defined); and (vi) $0.5 million of fees incurred in connection with the 2013 Revolver Amendments (as hereinafter defined).  Refer to \"Long-Term Debt Instruments - 2013 Debt Transactions\" below for the definition and further discussion of the debt instruments and related financing activities discussed above.\nLong-Term Debt Instruments\n(a) Recent Debt Transactions\nThe Company completed several debt transactions during 2015, 2014 and 2013:\n2015 Debt Related Transaction\nAmended Term Loan Facility - Excess Cash Flow Payment\nIn March 2015, Products Corporation prepaid $24.6 million of indebtedness, representing 50% of its 2014 excess cash flow,\u201d in accordance with the terms of its Amended Term Loan Facility. The prepayment was applied on a ratable basis between the principal amounts outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan and the Acquisition Term Loan. The amount of the prepayment applied to the 2011 Term Loan reduced the principal amount outstanding by $12.1 million to $662.9 million (as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan had been paid). The $12.5 million applied to the Acquisition Term Loan reduced Products Corporation's future regularly scheduled quarterly amortization payments under the Acquisition Term Loan on a ratable basis from $1.8 million prior to the prepayment to $1.7 million after giving effect to the prepayment and through its maturity on October 8, 2019.\n2014 Debt Related Transactions\nFebruary 2014 Term Loan Amendment\nIn February 2014, Products Corporation entered into an amendment (the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment\u201d) to its Amended Term Loan Agreement among Products Corporation, as borrower, a syndicate of lenders and Citicorp USA, Inc. ( CUSA\u201d), as administrative agent and collateral agent.\nPursuant to the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment, the interest rates applicable to Eurodollar Loans under the 2011 Term Loan bear interest at the Eurodollar Rate plus 2.5% per annum, with the Eurodollar Rate not to be less than 0.75% (compared to 3.0% and 1.0%, respectively, prior to the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment), while Alternate Base Rate Loans under the 2011 Term Loan bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus 1.5%, with the Alternate Base Rate not to be less than 1.75% (compared to 2.0% in each case prior to the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment) (and as each such term is defined in the Amended Term Loan Agreement).\nProducts Corporation's Acquisition Term Loan and Amended Revolving Credit Facility were not amended in connection with the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment.\nDuring 2014, the Company incurred approximately $1.1 million of fees and expenses in connection with the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment, which were expensed as incurred, and wrote-off $0.8 million of unamortized debt discount and deferred financing costs as a result of the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment. These amounts, totaling $1.9 million, were recognized within loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRepayment of Non-Contributed Loan\nOn May 1, 2014, Products Corporation used available cash on hand to optionally prepay in full the remaining $58.4 million principal amount then outstanding under the non-contributed loan portion of the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan Agreement (the \"Non-Contributed Loan\") that remained owing from Products Corporation to various third parties. The Non-Contributed Loan would have otherwise matured on October 8, 2014. In connection with such prepayment, the Company wrote-off $0.1 million of deferred financing costs, which were recognized within loss on early extinguishment of debt in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for 2014.\n2013 Debt Transactions\nTerm Loan and Revolving Credit Facility Amendments\n(i) February 2013 Term Loan Amendments\nIn February 2013, Products Corporation consummated amendments (the \"February 2013 Term Loan Amendments\") to its third amended and restated term loan agreement dated as of May 19, 2011 (as amended, the \"2011 Term Loan Agreement,\" or the 2011 Term Loan Facility\u201d or the \"2011 Term Loan\") among Products Corporation, as borrower, a syndicate of lenders and CUSA, as administrative agent and collateral agent.\nPursuant to the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments, Products Corporation reduced the total aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan at such time from $788.0 million to $675.0 million, using a portion of the proceeds from Products Corporation's issuance of its 5\u00be% Senior Notes (see 2013 Senior Notes Refinancing\u201d below), together with cash on hand. The February 2013 Term Loan Amendments also reduced the interest rates on the 2011 Term Loan such that (prior to giving effect to the February 2014 Term Loan Amendment) Eurodollar Loans bore interest at the Eurodollar Rate plus 3.00% per annum, with the Eurodollar Rate not to be less than 1.00% (compared to 3.50% and 1.25%, respectively, prior to the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments), while Alternate Base Rate Loans bore interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus 2.00%, with the Alternate Base Rate not to be less than 2.00% (compared to 2.50% and 2.25%, respectively, prior to the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments) (and as each such term is defined in the 2011 Term Loan Agreement).\nPursuant to the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments, Products Corporation, under certain circumstances, also has the right to request the 2011 Term Loan to be increased by up to the greater of: (i) $300 million; and (ii) an amount such that Products Corporation's First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2011 Term Loan Agreement) does not exceed 3.50:1.00 (compared to $300 million prior to the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments). The lenders are not committed to provide any such increase. Any such increase would be in addition to the Acquisition Term Loan.\n(ii) August 2013 Term Loan Amendments\nIn August 2013, in connection with the Colomer Acquisition, Products Corporation consummated further amendments (the \"August 2013 Term Loan Amendments\") to its 2011 Term Loan Agreement (as amended by the August 2013 Term Loan Amendments and the Incremental Amendment, the \"Amended Term Loan Agreement\" or the \"Amended Term Loan Facility\"), which permitted, among other things: (i) Products Corporation's consummation of the Colomer Acquisition; and (ii) Products Corporation's incurring up to $700 million of term loans which it used as a source of funds to consummate the Colomer Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses.\n(iii) Incremental Amendment\nIn August 2013, in connection with the Colomer Acquisition, Products Corporation entered into an incremental amendment (the \"Incremental Amendment\") resulting in the Amended Term Loan Agreement with Citibank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch (collectively, the \"Initial Acquisition Lenders\") and CUSA, as administrative agent and collateral agent, pursuant to which the Initial Acquisition Lenders committed to provide up to $700 million of term loans under the Amended Term Loan Agreement (the \"Acquisition Term Loan\"). The Acquisition Term Loan was issued on October 8, 2013 and Products Corporation used the net proceeds of $698.3 million as a source of funds to consummate the Colomer Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses.\n(iv) Amended Revolving Credit Facility\nIn August 2013, in connection with the Colomer Acquisition, Products Corporation consummated an amendment (the \"August 2013 Revolver Amendment\") to its third amended and restated revolving credit agreement dated June 16, 2011 (the \"2011 Revolving Credit Agreement\") which amended its then $140.0 million asset-backed, multi-currency revolving credit facility (the \"2011 Revolving Credit Facility\") to permit, among other things: (a) Products Corporation's consummation of the Colomer Acquisition; and (b) Products Corporation's incurring up to $700 million of the Acquisition Term Loan that Products Corporation used as a source of funds to consummate the Colomer Acquisition. Additionally, the August 2013 Revolver Amendment (1) reduced Products Corporation's interest rate spread over the LIBOR rate applicable to Eurodollar Loans under the facility from a range, based on availability, of 2.00% to 2.50%, to a range of 1.50% to 2.00%; (2) reduced the commitment fee on unused availability under the facility from 0.375% to 0.25%; and (3) extended the maturity of the facility, which was previously scheduled to mature in June 2016, to the earlier of (i) August 2018 or (ii) the date that is 90 days prior to the earliest maturity date of any term loans then outstanding under Products Corporation's bank term loan agreements, but not earlier than June 2016.\nAdditionally, in December 2013, Products Corporation entered into an incremental amendment (the \"December 2013 Revolver Amendment\" and together with the August 2013 Revolver Amendment, the \"2013 Revolver Amendments\") to its 2011 Revolving Credit Agreement (as amended by the 2013 Revolver Amendments, the \"Amended Revolving Credit Agreement\" and the \"Amended Revolving Credit Facility\"). Under the terms of the December 2013 Revolver Amendment, the lenders' commitment to provide borrowings to Products Corporation and its subsidiary borrowers under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility was increased from $140.0 million to $175.0 million.\n2013 Senior Notes Refinancing\nIn February 2013, Products Corporation issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5\u00be% Senior Notes due February 15, 2021 (the 5\u00be% Senior Notes\u201d) to investors at par. Products Corporation used $491.2 million of the net proceeds (net of underwriters' fees) from the issuance of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes to repay and redeem all of the $330.0 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its 9\u00be% Senior Secured Notes that were otherwise due November 2015 (the 9\u00be% Senior Secured Notes\"), as well as to pay an aggregate of $28.0 million for the applicable redemption and tender offer premiums, accrued interest and related fees and expenses. Products Corporation used a portion of the remaining proceeds, together with existing cash, to pay approximately $113.0 million of principal on its 2011 Term Loan in conjunction with the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments. Products Corporation used the remaining balance available from the issuance of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, debt reduction transactions, including the repayment of the Contributed Loan (as hereinafter defined) as described below.\nRepayment of the Contributed Loan\nOn October 8, 2013, Products Corporation paid to Revlon, Inc. at maturity the remaining $48.6 million portion of the principal amount then due under the Amended and Restated Senior Subordinated Term Loan Agreement (the \"Contributed Loan\"), which Revlon, Inc. used to pay the liquidation preference of Revlon, Inc.'s Series A Preferred Stock in connection with its mandatory redemption of such stock on such date.\n(b) Summary of Terms and Covenants\nAmended Credit Agreements\nThe following is a summary description of the Amended Term Loan Facility, which includes the 2011 Term Loan and the Acquisition Term Loan, and the Amended Revolving Credit Facility. Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms have the meanings given to them in the Amended Term Loan Agreement and/or the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement (the \"Amended Credit Agreements\"), as applicable. Investors should refer to the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement and/or the Amended Term Loan Agreement for complete terms and conditions, as these summary descriptions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions.\nAmended Term Loan Facility\nAs of December 31, 2015, term loans under the Amended Term Loan Facility bear interest at the following interest rates:\n\nThe term loans under the Amended Term Loan Facility are required to be prepaid with:\n(i) the net cash proceeds in excess of $10 million for each 12-month period ending on March 31 received during such period from sales of Term Loan First Lien Collateral by Products Corporation or any of its subsidiary guarantors with carryover of unused annual basket amounts up to a maximum of $25 million and with respect to certain specified dispositions up to an additional $25 million in the aggregate (subject to a reinvestment right for 365 days, or 545 days if the Company has within such 365-day period entered into a legally binding commitment to invest such funds);\n(ii) the net proceeds from the issuance by Products Corporation or any of its subsidiaries of certain additional debt; and\n(iii) 50% of Products Corporation's annual excess cash flow\u201d (as defined under the Amended Term Loan Agreement), which payments commenced with respect to Products Corporation's excess cash flow for the 2014 fiscal year; such payments are required to be made within the first 100 days after the applicable year end.\nPursuant to the August 2013 Term Loan Amendments, the Amended Term Loan Facility contains a financial covenant limiting Products Corporation's first lien senior secured leverage ratio (the ratio of Products Corporation's senior secured debt that has a lien on the collateral which secures the Amended Term Loan Facility that is not junior or subordinated to the liens securing the Amended Term Loan Facility (excluding debt outstanding under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility) to EBITDA, as each such term is defined in the Amended Term Loan Facility), to no more than 4.25 to 1.0 for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending during the period from June 30, 2011 to the maturity date of the Amended Term Loan Facility.\nProducts Corporation, under certain circumstances, also has the right to request the Amended Term Loan Facility to be increased by up to the greater of (i) $300 million and (ii) an amount such that Products Corporation's First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Term Loan Agreement) does not exceed 3.50:1.00 (compared to $300 million prior to the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments). The lenders are not committed to provide any such increase. Any such increase would be in addition to the Acquisition Term Loan that was issued in October 2013 and used as a source of funds to consummate the Colomer Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses.\nThe 2011 Term Loan outstanding under the Amended Term Loan Facility matures on November 19, 2017. The Acquisition Term Loan under the Amended Term Loan Facility has the same terms as the 2011 Term Loan, except that: (i) it matures on the sixth anniversary of the closing of the Acquisition Term Loan (or October 8, 2019); and (ii) it amortizes on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year, in an amount equal to 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of such Acquisition Term Loan.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Products Corporation is required to prepay, on or before 100 days following the last day of its fiscal year (i.e., by April 9, 2016), $23.2 million of indebtedness under the Amended Term Loan Facility, representing 50% of its 2015 \"excess cash flow\" (as defined under the Amended Term Loan Agreement). The prepayment will be applied on a ratable basis between the principal amounts outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan and the Acquisition Term Loan. The amount of the prepayment to be applied to the 2011 Term Loan will be used to reduce the aggregate principal amount outstanding (as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan have been paid), while the amount to be applied to the Acquisition Term Loan will be used to reduce Products Corporation's future annual amortization payments (which are payable in equal quarterly installments) on a ratable basis from $6.9 million prior to the prepayment to $6.8 million after giving effect to the prepayment and through its maturity on October 8, 2019.\nAmended Revolving Credit Facility\nAvailability under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility varies based on a borrowing base that is determined by the value of eligible trade receivables and eligible inventory in the U.S. and the U.K. and eligible real property and equipment in the U.S. from time to time.\nIn January 2014, the Colomer U.S. Subsidiaries became additional guarantors under Products Corporation's Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility and the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture. In January and May 2015, the New U.S. Subsidiaries became additional guarantors under such debt instruments. In connection with becoming guarantors, substantially all of the assets of such subsidiaries were pledged as collateral under Products Corporation's Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility, thereby increasing the value of the assets supporting the borrowing base under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility.\nIf the value of the eligible assets is not sufficient to support the $175.0 million borrowing base under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, Products Corporation will not have full access to the Amended Revolving Credit Facility. Products Corporation's ability to borrow under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility is also conditioned upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent and Products Corporation's compliance with other covenants in the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement.\nIn each case subject to borrowing base availability, the Amended Revolving Credit Facility is available to:\n(i) Products Corporation in revolving credit loans denominated in U.S. Dollars;\n(ii) Products Corporation in swing line loans denominated in U.S. Dollars up to $30.0 million;\n(iii) Products Corporation in standby and commercial letters of credit denominated in U.S. Dollars and other currencies up to $60.0 million; and\n(iv) Products Corporation and certain of its international subsidiaries designated from time to time in revolving credit loans and bankers' acceptances denominated in U.S. Dollars and other currencies.\nAs a result of the August 2013 Revolver Amendment, under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, borrowings (other than loans in foreign currencies) bear interest, if made as Eurodollar Loans, at the Eurodollar Rate plus the applicable margin set forth in the grid below and, if made as Alternate Base Rate Loans, at the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin set forth in the grid below.\n\nLocal Loans (as defined in the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement) bear interest, if mutually acceptable to Products Corporation and the relevant foreign lenders, at the Local Rate, and otherwise (i) if in foreign currencies or in U.S. Dollars at the Eurodollar Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate plus the applicable margin set forth in the grid above or (ii) if in U.S. Dollars at the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin set forth in the grid above.\nPrior to the termination date of the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, revolving loans are required to be prepaid (without any permanent reduction in commitment) with:\n(i) the net cash proceeds from sales of Revolving Credit First Lien Collateral by Products Corporation or any of Products Corporation's subsidiary guarantors (other than dispositions in the ordinary course of business and certain other exceptions); and\n(ii) the net proceeds from the issuance by Products Corporation or any of its subsidiaries of certain additional debt, to the extent there remains any such proceeds after satisfying Products Corporation's repayment obligations under the Amended Term Loan Facility.\nAs a result of the August 2013 Revolver Amendment, Products Corporation pays to the lenders under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility a commitment fee of 0.25% of the average daily unused portion of the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, which fee is payable quarterly in arrears. Under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, Products Corporation also pays:\n(i) to foreign lenders a fronting fee of 0.25% per annum on the aggregate principal amount of specified Local Loans (which fee is retained by foreign lenders out of the portion of the Applicable Margin payable to such foreign lender);\n(ii) to foreign lenders an administrative fee of 0.25% per annum on the aggregate principal amount of specified Local Loans;\n(iii) to the multi-currency lenders a letter of credit commission equal to the product of (a) the Applicable Margin for revolving credit loans that are Eurodollar Rate loans (adjusted for the term that the letter of credit is outstanding) and (b) the aggregate undrawn face amount of letters of credit; and\n(iv) to the issuing lender, a letter of credit fronting fee of 0.25% per annum of the aggregate undrawn face amount of letters of credit, which fee is a portion of the Applicable Margin.\nAs a result of the August 2013 Revolver Amendment, under certain circumstances, Products Corporation has the right to request that the Amended Revolving Credit Facility be increased by up to $100.0 million. The lenders are not committed to provide any such increase.\nUnder certain circumstances, if and when the difference between (i) the borrowing base under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) the amounts outstanding under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility is less than $20.0 million for a period of two consecutive days or more, and until such difference is equal to or greater than $20.0 million for a period of 30 consecutive business days, the Amended Revolving Credit Facility requires Products Corporation to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (the ratio of EBITDA minus Capital Expenditures to Cash Interest Expense for such period) of a minimum of 1.0 to 1.0.\nThe Amended Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of August 14, 2018 and the date that is 90 days prior to the earliest maturity date of any term loans then outstanding under the Amended Term Loan Facility, but not earlier than June 16, 2016.\nCovenants and Defaults Applicable to the Amended Term Loan Facility and the Amended Revolving Credit Facility\nThe Amended Credit Agreements contain various restrictive covenants prohibiting Products Corporation and its subsidiaries from:\n(i) incurring additional indebtedness or guarantees, with certain exceptions;\n(ii) making dividend and other payments or loans to Revlon, Inc. or other affiliates, with certain exceptions, including among others:\n(a) exceptions permitting Products Corporation to pay dividends or make other payments to Revlon, Inc. to enable it to, among other things, pay expenses incidental to being a public holding company, including, among other things, professional fees such as legal, accounting and insurance fees, regulatory fees, such as SEC filing fees and NYSE listing fees, and other expenses related to being a public holding company;\n(b) subject to certain circumstances, to finance the purchase by Revlon, Inc. of its Class A Common Stock in connection with the delivery of such Class A Common Stock to grantees under the Fourth Amended and Restated Revlon, Inc. Stock Plan and/or the payment of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards under such plan;\n(c) subject to certain limitations, to pay dividends or make other payments to finance the purchase, redemption or other retirement for value by Revlon, Inc. of stock or other equity interests or equivalents in Revlon, Inc. held by any current or former director, employee or consultant in his or her capacity as such; and\n(d) subject to certain limitations, to make other restricted payments to Products Corporation's affiliates in an amount up to $10 million per year (plus $10 million for each calendar year commencing with 2011), other restricted payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $35 million and certain other restricted payments, including without limitation those based upon certain financial tests;\n(iii) creating liens or other encumbrances on Products Corporation's or its subsidiaries' assets or revenues, granting negative pledges or selling or transferring any of Products Corporation's or its subsidiaries' assets, all subject to certain limited exceptions;\n(iv) with certain exceptions, engaging in merger or acquisition transactions;\n(v) prepaying indebtedness and modifying the terms of certain indebtedness and specified material contractual obligations, subject to certain exceptions;\n(vi) making investments, subject to certain exceptions; and\n(vii) entering into transactions with Products Corporation's affiliates involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $10 million other than upon terms that are not materially less favorable when taken as a whole to Products Corporation or its subsidiaries as terms that would be obtainable at the time for a comparable transaction or series of similar transactions in arm's length dealings with an unrelated third person and where such payments or consideration exceed $20 million, unless such transaction has been approved by all of Products Corporation's independent directors, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe events of default under each of the Amended Term Loan Agreement and the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement include customary events of default for such types of agreements. For a description of the events of defaults, see Note 11, \"Long-Term Debt\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. If Products Corporation is in default under the senior secured leverage ratio under the Amended Term Loan Facility or the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio under the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement, Products Corporation may cure such default by issuing certain equity securities to, or receiving capital contributions from, Revlon, Inc. and applying such cash which is deemed to increase EBITDA for the purpose of calculating the applicable ratio. Products Corporation may exercise this cure right two times in any four-quarter period.\nProducts Corporation was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Amended Term Loan Agreement and the Amended Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, the aggregate principal amounts outstanding under the Acquisition Term Loan and the 2011 Term Loan were $673.7 million and $662.9 million, respectively, and availability under the $175.0 million Amended Revolving Credit Facility, based upon the calculated borrowing base less $8.8 million of outstanding undrawn letters of credit and nil then drawn on the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, was $166.2 million. There were no borrowings under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility during 2015.\n5\u00be% Senior Notes\nIn February 2013, Products Corporation completed its offering (the \"2013 Senior Notes Refinancing\"), pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the \"Securities Act\"), of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes. The 5\u00be% Senior Notes are unsecured and were issued under the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture to investors at par. The 5\u00be% Senior Notes mature on February 15, 2021. Interest on the 5\u00be% Senior Notes accrues at 5\u00be% per annum, paid every six months on February 15th and August 15th. The 5\u00be% Senior Notes were issued pursuant to the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture, dated as of February 8, 2013 (the Notes Closing Date\u201d), by and among Products Corporation, Products Corporation's domestic subsidiaries (the Guarantors\u201d), which also currently guarantee Products Corporation's Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Guarantors issued guarantees (the Guarantees\u201d) of Products Corporation's obligations under the 5\u00be% Senior Notes and the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture on a joint and several, senior unsecured basis. The Colomer U.S. Subsidiaries became additional guarantors in January 2014 and the New U.S. Subsidiaries became additional guarantors in January and May 2015, in each case under Products Corporation's Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility and the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture.\nIn December 2013, Products Corporation consummated an offer to exchange the original 5\u00be% Senior Notes for $500 million of new 5\u00be% Senior Notes, which have substantially the same terms as the original 5\u00be% Senior Notes, except that they are registered under the Securities Act (such registered new notes being the 5\u00be% Senior Notes\u201d).\nProducts Corporation used a portion of the $491.2 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes (net of underwriters' fees) to repay and redeem all of the $330.0 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its 9\u00be% Senior Secured Notes, as well as to pay $8.6 million of accrued interest. Products Corporation incurred an aggregate of $19.4 million of fees for the applicable redemption and tender offer premiums, related fees and expenses in connection with redemption and repayment of the 9\u00be% Senior Secured Notes and other fees and expenses in connection with the issuance of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes. Products Corporation used a portion of the remaining proceeds from the issuance of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes, together with existing cash, to pay approximately $113.0 million of principal on its 2011 Term Loan in conjunction with the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments. Products Corporation used the remaining balance available from the issuance of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, debt reduction transactions, such as repaying to Revlon, Inc. at maturity on October 8, 2013 the Contributed Loan, which Revlon, Inc. used to pay the liquidation preference of Revlon, Inc.'s then outstanding Series A Preferred Stock in connection with its mandatory redemption on such date.\nRanking\nThe 5\u00be% Senior Notes are Products Corporation's unsubordinated, unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated obligations of Products Corporation and rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior debt of Products Corporation. Similarly, each Guarantee is the relevant Guarantor's joint and several, unsubordinated and unsecured obligation and ranks senior in right of payment to any future subordinated obligations of such Guarantor and ranks pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior debt of such Guarantor. The Guarantees were issued on a joint and several basis.\nThe 5\u00be% Senior Notes and the Guarantees rank effectively junior to Products Corporation's Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility, which are secured, as well as indebtedness and preferred stock of Products Corporation's foreign and immaterial subsidiaries (the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries\u201d), none of which guarantee the 5\u00be% Senior Notes.\nOptional Redemption\nOn and after February 15, 2016, the 5\u00be% Senior Notes may be redeemed at Products Corporation's option, at any time as a whole, or from time to time in part, at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount), plus accrued interest to the date of redemption, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on February 15th of the years indicated below:\n\nProducts Corporation may redeem the 5\u00be% Senior Notes at its option at any time or from time to time prior to February 15, 2016, as a whole or in part, at a redemption price per 5\u00be% Senior Note equal to the sum of: (1) the then outstanding principal amount thereof; plus (2) accrued and unpaid interest (if any) to the date of redemption; and plus (3) the applicable premium based on the applicable treasury rate plus 75 basis points.\nPrior to February 15, 2016, Products Corporation may, from time to time, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes and any additional notes with, and to the extent Products Corporation actually receives, the net proceeds of one or more equity offerings from time to time, at 105.75%of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption.\nChange of Control\nUpon the occurrence of specified change of control events, Products Corporation is required to make an offer to purchase all of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the outstanding principal amount of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes as of the date of any such repurchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.\nCertain Covenants\nThe 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture limits Products Corporation's and the Guarantors' ability, and the ability of certain other subsidiaries, to:\n \u2022 incur or guarantee additional indebtedness ( Limitation on Debt\u201d); \n \u2022 pay dividends, make repayments on indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the 5\u00be% Senior Notes and make other restricted payments\u201d ( Limitation on Restricted Payments\u201d); \n \u2022 make certain investments; \n \u2022 create liens on their assets to secure debt; \n \u2022 enter into transactions with affiliates; \n \u2022 merge, consolidate or amalgamate with another company ( Successor Company\u201d); \n \u2022 transfer and sell assets ( Limitation on Asset Sales\u201d); and \n \u2022 permit restrictions on the payment of dividends by Products Corporation's subsidiaries ( Limitation on Dividends from Subsidiaries\u201d).  These covenants are subject to important qualifications and exceptions. The 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture also contains customary affirmative covenants and events of default.\nIn addition, if during any period of time the 5\u00be% Senior Notes receive investment grade ratings from both Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture, Products Corporation and its subsidiaries will not be subject to the covenants on Limitation on Debt, Limitation on Restricted Payments, Limitation on Asset Sales, Limitation on Dividends from Subsidiaries and certain provisions of the Successor Company covenant.\nCovenants\nProducts Corporation was in compliance with all applicable covenants under its 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nSpanish Government Loan\nIn connection with the Colomer Acquisition, the Company acquired the Colomer Group's euro-denominated loan payable to the Spanish government (the \"Spanish Government Loan\"), which loan had $0.6 million aggregate principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2015 (based on foreign exchange rates in effect as of such date). The Spanish Government Loan does not bear interest and is payable in 10 equal installments on June 30th of each year beginning in 2016 through 2025.\nImpact of Foreign Currency Translation - Venezuela\nRevlon Venezuela's net sales are de minimis, representing approximately 1% of the Company's consolidated net sales for each 2015, 2014 and 2013. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, Revlon Venezuela's assets represented approximately 1% of the Company's total assets, respectively.\nVenezuela - Highly-Inflationary Economy: Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. As a result, beginning January 1, 2010, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency for the Company's subsidiary in Venezuela ( Revlon Venezuela\u201d). As Venezuela is designated as highly inflationary, foreign currency translation adjustments of Revlon Venezuela's balance sheet have been reflected in the Company's earnings.\nVenezuela - Currency Restrictions: Foreign currency restrictions enacted by the Venezuelan government since 2003 have become more restrictive and have impacted Revlon Venezuela's ability to obtain U.S. Dollars in exchange for Venezuelan Bolivars (\"Bolivars\") at the official foreign exchange rates from the Venezuelan government and its foreign exchange commission, the Comisi\u00f3n de Administracion de Divisas ( CADIVI\u201d). In May 2010, the Venezuelan government took control over the previously freely-traded foreign currency exchange market and, in June 2010, replaced it with a new foreign currency exchange system, the Sistema de Transacciones en Moneda Extranjera ( SITME\u201d). In the second quarter of 2011, the Company began using a SITME rate of 5.5 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar (the \"SITME Rate\") to translate Revlon Venezuela's financial statements, as this was the rate at which the Company accessed U.S. Dollars in the SITME market during this period. Through December 31, 2012, the Company continued using the SITME Rate to translate Revlon Venezuela's financial statements.\nVenezuela - 2013 Foreign Currency Devaluation: In February 2013, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of Bolivars relative to the U.S. Dollar, changing the official exchange rate to 6.3 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar (the \"Official Rate\"). The Venezuelan government also announced that the SITME foreign currency market administered by Venezuela's central bank would be eliminated, and as a result, the Company began using the Official Rate to translate Revlon Venezuela's financial statements beginning in 2013. To reflect the impact of the foreign currency devaluation, the Company recorded a one-time foreign currency loss of $0.6 million in earnings in the first quarter of 2013 as a result of the required re-measurement of Revlon Venezuela's monetary assets and liabilities.\nVenezuela - 2014 Foreign Currency Devaluation: In January 2014, the Venezuela government announced that the CADIVI would be replaced by the government-operated National Center of Foreign Commerce (the \"CENCOEX\"), and indicated that the Sistema Complementario de Administraci\u00f3n de Divisas ( SICAD\u201d) market would continue to be offered as an alternative foreign currency exchange. Additionally, a parallel foreign currency exchange system, SICAD II, started functioning in March 2014 and allowed companies to apply for the purchase of foreign currency and foreign currency denominated securities for any legal use or purpose. Throughout 2014, the Company exchanged Bolivars for U.S. Dollars to the extent permitted through the various foreign currency markets available based on its ability to participate in those markets. Prior to June 30, 2014, the Company utilized the Official Rate and following a consideration of the Company's specific facts and circumstances, which included its legal ability and intent to participate in the SICAD II exchange market to import finished goods into Venezuela, the Company determined that it was appropriate to utilize the SICAD II rate of 53 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar (the \"SICAD II Rate\") to translate Revlon Venezuela's financial statements beginning on June 30, 2014. As a result, the Company recorded a foreign currency loss of $6.0 million in the second quarter of 2014 related to the required re-measurement of Revlon Venezuela's monetary assets and liabilities. For 2014, the change to the SICAD II Rate of 53 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar, as compared to the Official Rate of 6.3 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar, had the impact of reducing the Company's consolidated net sales by $16.2 million and reducing the Company's consolidated operating income by $8.4 million.\nVenezuela - 2015 Foreign Currency Devaluation: In February 2015, the Venezuela government introduced a new foreign currency exchange platform, the Marginal Currency System (\"SIMADI\"), which created a third new mechanism to exchange Bolivars for U.S. Dollars through private brokers. SIMADI replaced the SICAD II system and started operating on February 12, 2015. As a result, the Company considered its specific facts and circumstances in order to determine the appropriate rate of exchange to translate Revlon Venezuela's financial statements. Through December 31, 2015, the Company has not participated in the SIMADI exchange market; however, given the elimination of the SICAD II system, the Company determined that it was appropriate to use the SIMADI rate of 193 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar (the \"SIMADI Rate\") to translate Revlon Venezuela's balance sheet beginning on March 31, 2015.\nAs a result of the change from the SICAD II Rate to the SIMADI Rate on March 31, 2015, the Company was required to re-measure all of Revlon Venezuela's monetary assets and liabilities at the SIMADI Rate. Using the SIMADI Rate, the Company recorded a foreign currency loss of $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2015 as a result of the required re-measurement of Revlon Venezuela's balance sheet. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company exited its business operations in Venezuela and changed to a distributor model. Current or additional governmental restrictions, worsening import authorization controls, price and profit controls or labor unrest in Venezuela could impact the Company's ability to sell to the distributor in Venezuela.\nSources and Uses\nThe Company's principal sources of funds are expected to be operating revenues, cash on hand and funds available for borrowing under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility and other permitted lines of credit. The Amended Credit Agreements, and the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture contain certain provisions that by their terms limit Products Corporation and its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur additional debt.\nThe Company's principal uses of funds are expected to be the payment of operating expenses, including expenses in connection with the continued execution of the Company's business strategy; purchases of permanent wall displays; capital expenditure requirements; debt service payments and costs; cash tax payments; pension and other post-retirement benefit plan contributions; payments in connection with the Company's restructuring programs; business and/or brand acquisitions (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), if any; severance not otherwise included in the Company's restructuring programs; debt and/or equity repurchases, if any; costs related to litigation; and payments in connection with discontinuing non-core business lines and/or exiting certain territories. The Company's cash contributions to its pension and post-retirement benefit plans in 2015 were $18.1 million. The Company expects cash contributions to its pension and post-retirement benefit plans to be approximately $20 million in the aggregate for 2016. The Company's cash taxes paid in 2015 were $25.2 million. The Company expects to pay cash taxes of approximately $55 million in the aggregate for 2016. The Company's purchases of permanent wall displays and capital expenditures in 2015 were $47.4 million and $48.3 million, respectively. The Company expects purchases of permanent wall displays and capital expenditures to be approximately $50.0 million and $55.0 million, respectively, in the aggregate for 2016. See also Note 2, \"Business Combinations,\" for discussion regarding the utilization of funds related to the Company's April 2015 CBB Acquisition.\nThe Company has undertaken, and continues to assess, refine and implement, a number of programs to efficiently manage its working capital, including, among other things, initiatives intended to optimize inventory levels over time; centralized procurement to secure discounts and efficiencies; prudent management of trade receivables and accounts payable; and controls on general and administrative spending. In the ordinary course of business, the Company's source or use of cash from operating activities may vary on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of working capital flows.\nContinuing to execute the Company's business strategy could include taking advantage of additional opportunities to reposition, repackage or reformulate one or more brands or product lines, launching additional new products, acquiring businesses or brands (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), divesting or discontinuing non-core business lines (which may include exiting certain territories), further refining the Company's approach to retail merchandising and/or taking further actions to optimize its manufacturing, sourcing and organizational size and structure, including optimizing the Colomer Acquisition and CBB Acquisition. Any of these actions, the intended purpose of which would be to create value through improving the Company's financial performance, could result in the Company making investments and/or recognizing charges related to executing against such opportunities. Any such activities may be funded with cash on hand, funds available under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility and/or other permitted additional sources of capital, which actions could increase the Company's total debt.\nThe Company may also, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt obligations and/or equity in open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise and may seek to refinance some or all of its indebtedness based upon market conditions. Any retirement or purchase of debt and/or equity may be funded with operating cash flows of the business or other sources and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may be material.\nThe Company expects that operating revenues, cash on hand and funds available for borrowing under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility and other permitted lines of credit will be sufficient to enable the Company to pay its operating expenses for 2016, including expenses in connection with the execution of the Company's business strategy, purchases of permanent wall displays, capital expenditure requirements, debt service payments and costs, cash tax payments, pension and other post-retirement plan contributions, payments in connection with the Company's restructuring programs, business and/or brand acquisitions (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), if any, severance not otherwise included in the Company's restructuring programs, debt and/or equity repurchases, if any, costs related to litigation and/or discontinuing non-core business lines and/or exiting certain territories.\nThere can be no assurance that available funds will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements on a consolidated basis. If the Company's anticipated level of revenues is not achieved because of, among other things, decreased consumer spending in response to weak economic conditions or weakness in the consumption of beauty care products in one or more of the Consumer, Professional and/or Other segments; adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency controls and/or government-mandated pricing controls; decreased sales of the Company's products as a result of increased competitive activities by the Company's competitors and/or decreased performance by third party suppliers; changes in consumer purchasing habits, including with respect to retailer preferences and/or among professional salons; inventory management by the Company's customers; space reconfigurations or reductions in display space by the Company's customers; changes in pricing, marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies by the Company's customers; or less than anticipated results from the Company's existing or new products or from its advertising, promotional, pricing and/or marketing plans; or if the Company's expenses, including, without limitation, for restructuring costs, acquisition and integration costs , costs related to litigation, advertising, promotional and marketing activities or for sales returns related to any reduction of space by the Company's customers, product discontinuances or otherwise, exceed the anticipated level of expenses, the Company's current sources of funds may be insufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements.\nAny such developments, if significant, could reduce the Company's revenues and operating income and could adversely affect Products Corporation's ability to comply with certain financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreements and in such event the Company could be required to take measures, including, among other things, reducing discretionary spending. (See Item 1A. \"Risk Factors - The Company's ability to service its debt and meet its cash requirements depends on many factors, including achieving anticipated levels of revenue and expenses. If such revenue or expense levels prove to be other than as anticipated, the Company may be unable to meet its cash requirements or Products Corporation may be unable to meet the requirements of the financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations\" and certain other risk factors discussing certain risks associated with the company's business and indebtedness).\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nForeign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts\nProducts Corporation enters into FX Contracts and option contracts from time to time to hedge certain net cash flows denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of the Company's foreign and domestic operations. The FX Contracts are entered into primarily for the purpose of hedging anticipated inventory purchases and certain intercompany payments denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of the Company's foreign and domestic operations and generally have maturities of less than one year. At December 31, 2015, the FX Contracts outstanding had a notional amount of $76.3 million and a net asset fair value of $1.4 million.\nInterest Rate Swap Transaction\nIn November 2013, Products Corporation executed a forward-starting floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction with a 1.00% floor, based on a notional amount of $400 million in respect of indebtedness under the Acquisition Term Loan over a period of three years (the \"2013 Interest Rate Swap\"). The Company designated the 2013 Interest Rate Swap as a cash flow hedge of the variability of the forecasted three-month LIBOR interest rate payments related to the $400 million notional amount under Products Corporation's Acquisition Term Loan over the three-year term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap. Commencing in May 2015, Products Corporation receives from the counterparty a floating interest rate based on the higher of three-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR or 1.00%, while paying a fixed interest rate payment to the counterparty equal to 2.0709% (which effectively fixes the interest rate on such notional amount at 5.0709% over the three-year term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap). For the year ended December 31, 2015, the 2013 Interest Rate Swap was deemed effective and therefore the changes in fair value related to the 2013 Interest Rate Swap have been recorded in Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair value of the Company's 2013 Interest Rate Swap at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was a liability of $6.5 million and $3.5 million, respectively.\nCredit Risk\nExposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of the derivative instruments in asset positions, which totaled $2.0 million and $0.2 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The Company attempts to minimize exposure to credit risk by generally entering into derivative contracts with counterparties that have investment-grade credit ratings and are major financial institutions. The Company also periodically monitors any changes in the credit ratings of its counterparties. Given the current credit standing of the counterparties to the Company's derivative instruments, the Company believes the risk of loss arising from any non-performance by any of the counterparties under these derivative instruments is remote.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nDisclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table aggregates all contractual obligations and commercial commitments that affect the Company's financial condition and liquidity position as of December 31, 2015:\n\n (a) Consists primarily of (i) the $662.9 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan as of December 31, 2015; (ii) the $673.7 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Acquisition Term Loan as of December 31, 2015; and (iii) the $500.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 5\u00be% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2015. \n (b) Consists of interest through the respective maturity dates on the outstanding debt discussed in (a) above; based on interest rates under such debt agreements as of December 31, 2015. \n (c) Included in the obligations for operating leases as of December 31, 2015 is the lease for the Company's headquarters in New York City, which includes minimum lease payments in the aggregate of approximately $70 million over the 15-year term. \n (d) Consists of purchase commitments for finished goods, raw materials, components and services pursuant to enforceable and legally binding obligations which include all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. \n (e) Consists primarily of media and advertising contracts, pension funding obligations (amount due within one year only, as subsequent pension funding obligation amounts cannot be reasonably estimated since the return on pension assets in future periods, as well as future pension assumptions, are not known), software licensing agreements and obligations related to third-party warehousing and distribution services. Such amounts exclude employment agreements, severance and other immaterial contractual commitments, which severance and other contractual commitments related to restructuring activities are discussed in Note 3, Restructuring Charges,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. \nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nThe Company does not maintain any off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nDiscussion of Critical Accounting Policies\nIn the ordinary course of its business, the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Company's most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts:\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical experience and ongoing evaluations of the Company's receivables and evaluations of the risks of payment. The allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against trade receivable balances when they are deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of trade receivables previously reserved are recorded in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss) when received.\nSales Returns:\nThe Company allows customers, primarily within its Consumer segment, to return their unsold products when they meet certain company-established criteria as outlined in the Company's trade terms. The Company regularly reviews and revises, when deemed necessary, the Company's estimates of sales returns based primarily upon historical product returns experience, planned product discontinuances and promotional sales, which would permit customers to return products based upon the Company's trade terms. The Company records estimated sales returns as a reduction to sales and cost of sales, and an increase in accrued liabilities and inventories.\nReturned products, which are recorded as inventories, are valued based upon the amount that the Company expects to realize upon their subsequent disposition. The physical condition and marketability of the returned products are the major factors the Company considers in estimating realizable value. Cost of sales includes the cost of refurbishment of returned products. Actual returns, as well as realized values on returned products, may differ significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the Company's estimates if factors such as product discontinuances, customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company's estimates and expectations and, in the case of actual product returns, if economic conditions differ significantly from the Company's estimates and expectations.\nTrade Support Costs:\nIn order to support the retail trade, the Company has various performance-based arrangements with retailers to reimburse them for all or a portion of their promotional activities related to the Company's products. The Company regularly reviews and revises, when deemed necessary, estimates of costs to the Company for these promotions based on estimates of what has been incurred by the retailers. Actual costs incurred by the Company may differ significantly if factors such as the level and success of the retailers' programs, as well as retailer participation levels, differ from the Company's estimates and expectations.\nInventories:\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is based on standard cost and production variances, which approximates actual cost on the first-in, first-out method. Cost components include direct materials, direct labor and direct overhead, as well as in-bound freight. The Company records adjustments to the value of inventory based upon its forecasted plans to sell its inventories, as well as planned discontinuances. The physical condition (e.g., age and quality) of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation. These adjustments are estimates, which could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the amounts that the Company may ultimately realize upon the disposition of inventories if future economic conditions, customer inventory levels, product discontinuances, sales return levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company's estimates and expectations.\nPension Benefits:\nThe Company sponsors both funded and unfunded pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering employees who meet the applicable eligibility requirements. The Company uses several statistical and other factors in an attempt to estimate future events in calculating the liability and net periodic benefit income/cost related to these plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected long-term return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined annually by the Company, within certain guidelines, which assumptions would be subject to revisions if significant events occur during the year. The Company uses December 31st as its measurement date for defined benefit pension plan obligations and plan assets.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company adopted an alternative approach to calculating the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other post-retirement benefits, the full yield curve\u201d approach. Under this method, the discount rate assumption was built through the application of specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for each of the Company's pension and other retirement plans. Prior to December 31, 2015, the Company estimated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. This change does not affect the measurement of the Company's total benefit obligations, as the change in service and interest costs is exactly offset in the actuarial loss (gain) recognized for each year. The Company made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. The change has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle, and accordingly, has been accounted for prospectively.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nThe Company utilized a 4.15% weighted average discount rate in 2015 for the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans, compared to a 3.89% weighted average discount rate in 2014. The Company utilized a 3.68% weighted average discount rate for the Company's international defined benefit pension plans in 2015, compared to a 3.74% weighted average discount rate selected in 2014. The discount rates are used to measure the benefit obligations at the measurement date and the net periodic benefit income/cost for the subsequent calendar year and are reset annually using data available at the measurement date. The changes in the discount rates used for 2015 were primarily due to observed increases in long-term interest yields on high-quality corporate bonds from 2014. At December 31, 2015, the increase in the discount rates from December 31, 2014 had the effect of decreasing the Company's projected pension benefit obligation by approximately $15 million.\nIn selecting its expected long-term rate of return on its plan assets, the Company considers a number of factors, including, without limitation, recent and historical performance of plan assets, the plan portfolios' asset allocations over a variety of time periods compared with third-party studies, the performance of the capital markets in recent years and other factors, as well as advice from various third parties, such as the plans' advisors, investment managers and actuaries. While the Company considered both the recent performance and the historical performance of plan assets, the Company's assumptions are based primarily on its estimates of long-term, prospective rates of return. The difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Those gains or losses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods. For the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the expected long-term rate of return on the pension plan assets used was 7.50% for 2015 and 7.75% for 2014. The weighted average expected long-term rate of return used for the Company's international plans was 6.00% for both 2015 and 2014. For 2015, the Company's pension plans assets realized a loss of $13.9 million, as compared with expected return on assets of $40.3 million. The resulting net deferred loss of $54.2 million, when combined with gains and losses from previous years, will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 10 to 30 years. The actual return on plan assets was below expectations, primarily due to lower returns in developed equity markets and bond yields.\nThe table below reflects the Company's estimates of the possible effects that changes in the discount rates and expected long-term rates of return would have had on its 2015 net periodic benefit costs and its projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2015 for the Company's principal defined benefit pension plans, with all other assumptions remaining constant:\n\nThe rate of future compensation increases is another assumption used by the Company's third party actuarial consultants for pension accounting. The rate of future compensation increases used for the Company's projected pension benefit obligation in 2015 was 3.50%, as compared to 3.00% in 2014 for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Such increase was not applied to the Revlon Employees' Retirement Plan and the Revlon Pension Equalization Plan, as the rate of future compensation increases is no longer relevant to such plans due to plan amendments which effectively froze these plans as of December 31, 2009.\nIn addition, the Company's actuarial consultants also use other factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants, among other things. Differences from these assumptions could significantly impact the actual amount of net periodic benefit cost and liability recorded by the Company.\nTo determine the fiscal 2016 net periodic benefit income/cost, the Company is using the \"full yield curve approach\" described above to separately calculate discount rates for each of the service and interest components. The following table represents the weighted average discount rates used in calculating each component of service and interest costs for the Company's U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans:\n\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nFor 2016, the Company is using long-term rates of return on pension plan assets of 7.00% and 6.00% for its U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans, respectively. The Company expects that the impact in 2016 of the change in calculating the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other post-retirement benefits following the adoption of the full yield curve approach as discussed above will result in net periodic benefit income of approximately $5.1 million for 2016. The Company expects that the impact of the changes in discount rates and the return on plan assets in 2016 will result in net periodic benefit expense of $3.4 million for 2016, compared to $1.9 million of net periodic benefit income in 2015.\nGoodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets:\nIn determining the fair values of net assets acquired, including trade names, customer relationships and other intangible assets, and resulting goodwill related to the Company's business acquisitions, the Company considers, among other factors, the analyses of historical financial performance and an estimate of the future performance of the acquired business. The fair values of the acquired intangible assets are primarily calculated using a discounted cash flow approach.\nDetermining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations. There are significant judgments inherent in a discounted cash flow approach, including, the selection of appropriate discount rates, hypothetical royalty rates, contributory asset capital charges, estimating the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and identification of appropriate terminal growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in discounted cash flow analyses are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the respective acquired intangible assets.\nDetermining an acquired intangible asset's useful life requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including the expected use of the asset, consumer awareness, trade name history and future expansion expectations, as well as any contractual provisions that could limit or extend an asset's useful life. The Company believes that an acquired trade name has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and the Company has the intent and ability to support the trade name with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If this indefinite-lived criteria is not met, acquired trade names are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from five to 20 years.\nGoodwill totaled $469.7 million and $464.1 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the goodwill of $210.1 million, $240.7 million and $18.9 million related to the Consumer, Professional and Other segments, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangibles totaled $95.0 million and $101.3 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but rather are reviewed annually for impairment using September 30th carrying values, or when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current carrying amounts may not be recovered. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to any such excess. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company establishes its reporting units based on its current reporting structure, product characteristics and management. Within the Consumer segment, the Company has identified two reporting units: (i) \"Global Color Brands,\" which include the SinfulColors and Pure Ice nail enamel brands; and (ii) \"Revlon, Almay and Other,\" which includes the remainder of the Company's Consumer brands and does not include brands of the Company's Other reportable segment. The Company's other reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 18, Segment Data and Related Information.\u201d For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to each reporting unit to the extent that goodwill relates to each reporting unit.\nFor 2015, the Company utilized the two-step process as prescribed by ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, in order to identify potential impairment for each of its reporting units. In the first step of this test, the Company compared the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units, determined based upon discounted estimated future cash flows, to the respective carrying amount, including goodwill. Where the fair value of such reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount, no further work was required and no impairment loss was recognized. The results of the step one test indicated that impairment indicators may have existed for the Company's Global Color Brands reporting unit as a result of the observed decline in sales of the Pure Ice nail enamel brand, primarily driven by the effects of declines in the promotional activity for the Pure Ice brand at retailers, and accordingly, the Company performed step two of the goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit.\nIn the second step, the Company measured the potential impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the Global Color Brands reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill at September 30, 2015. The implied fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination, where the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was allocated to all the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit (including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid. When the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of that reporting unit's goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized within operations. The Company determined the fair value of the Global Color Brands reporting unit using discounted estimated future cash flows. The weighted average cost of capital in testing the Global Color Brands reporting unit for impairment was 13.0% with a perpetual growth rate of 2.0%. As a result of this annual impairment test, the Company recognized a $9.7 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nthe Global Color Brands reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2015. Following the recognition of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge, the Global Color Brands reporting unit has remaining goodwill in the amount of $25.6 million at December 31, 2015.\nAs of the date of the latest impairment test, the fair values of the (i) Revlon, Almay and Other; (ii) Professional; and (iii) Other reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately $2.5 billion, $310.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively. The Company did not record any impairment of identified intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFor 2014 and 2013, the Company performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it would be necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test and to assess the Company's indefinite lived intangible assets for indicators of impairment, and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying amounts. The Company did not record any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2013.\nSee Note 2, Business Combinations\u201d and Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net\u201d for further discussion of the Company's goodwill and intangible assets.\nIncome Taxes:\nThe Company records income taxes based on amounts payable with respect to the current year and includes the effect of deferred taxes. The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax-planning opportunities that may be available in various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, and the Company's estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Determining the Company's effective tax rate and evaluating tax positions requires significant judgment.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which management expects that the Company will recover or settle those differences. The realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on forecasted future taxable income. The Company has established valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize a tax benefit. Any reduction in estimated forecasted future taxable income may require the Company to record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance was not previously established. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Provision for income taxes,\u201d for further discussion.\nThe Company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the merits of such position. The Company recognizes liabilities for unrecognized tax positions in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts is ultimately not required, the reversal of the liabilities would result in additional tax benefits recognized in the period in which the Company determines that the liabilities are no longer required. If the estimate of tax liabilities is ultimately less than the final assessment, this will result in a further charge to expense. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.\nThe Company provides for U.S. federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on foreign subsidiaries' cumulative undistributed earnings when it is not the Company's intent to indefinitely reinvest such earnings overseas. No provision is made for U.S. income taxes where the Company's plan is to indefinitely reinvest such undistributed earnings from the Company's foreign operations in its overseas operations. If these future foreign earnings are repatriated to the U.S., or if the Company determines that such foreign earnings will be remitted to the U.S. in the foreseeable future, additional U.S. tax provisions may be required.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-08, \"Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity,\" which changes the requirements for reporting discontinued operations under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 205. Under ASU No. 2014-08, a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. The standard states that a strategic shift could include a disposal of: (i) a major geographical area of operations; (ii) a major line of business; (iii) a major equity method investment; or (iv) other major parts of an entity. ASU No. 2014-08 no longer precludes presentation as a discontinued operation if: (i) there are operations and cash flows of the component that have not been eliminated from the reporting entity's ongoing operations; or (ii) there is significant continuing involvement with a component after its disposal. Additional disclosures about discontinued operations will also be required. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and is to be applied prospectively to new disposals and new classifications of disposal groups as held for sale after the effective date. The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-08 on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2015, and such adoption did not have an impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or financial statement disclosures.\nREVLON CONSUMER PRODUCTS CORPORTATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(all tabular amounts in millions)\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards or Updates Not Yet Effective\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,\" which requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent within a company's balance sheet. Currently, the Company is required to separate deferred income tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts on its classified balance sheet, and this update will simplify the presentation by requiring a single, noncurrent amount. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-17 beginning on January 1, 2016 and the adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, \"Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments,\" which eliminates the current requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-16 beginning on January 1, 2016 and the adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, \"Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,\" which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by requiring inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value, rather than at the lower of cost or market. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt ASU No. 2015-11 beginning on January 1, 2017. The Company is evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and financial statement disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, \"Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\" which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the financial statements as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied retrospectively. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03 beginning on January 1, 2016 and the adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in the ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The core principle of ASU No. 2014-09 is for companies to recognize revenue from the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 also will result in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provide guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively (for example, service revenue and contract modifications) and improve guidance for multiple-element arrangements. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption prohibited. The Company expects to adopt ASU No. 2014-09 beginning January 1, 2018 and is in the process of assessing the impact that the new guidance will have on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and financial statement disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, \"Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,\" that will explicitly require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures if conditions give rise to substantial doubt. According to ASU No. 2014-15, substantial doubt exists if it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations within one year after the issuance date. The likelihood threshold of \"probable,\" similar to its current use in U.S. GAAP for loss contingencies, will be used to define substantial doubt. Disclosures will be required under ASU No. 2014-15 if conditions give rise to substantial doubt including whether and how management's plans will alleviate the substantial doubt. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption prohibited. The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-15 beginning January 1, 2016 and the adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.\nInflation\nThe Company's costs are affected by inflation and the effects of inflation that the Company may experience in future periods.
