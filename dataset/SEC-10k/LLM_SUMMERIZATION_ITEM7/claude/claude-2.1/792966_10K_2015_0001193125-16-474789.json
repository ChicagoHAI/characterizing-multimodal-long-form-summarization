MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and the Company follows general practices within the financial services industry in which it operates. At times the application of these principles requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These assumptions, estimates and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. As this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different assumptions, estimates and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on assumptions, estimates and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Examples of critical assumptions, estimates and judgments are when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not required to be recorded at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability must be recorded contingent upon a future event.\nAll significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued and how those values are determined for the financial statements. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to assumptions, estimates and judgments underlying those amounts, management has identified the determination of the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) and the valuation of its Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) and Other Real Estate Owned (ORE) as the accounting areas that requires the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be the most subject to revision as new information becomes available.\nAssets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nThe ALLL represents management's estimate of credit losses inherent in the Bank's loan portfolio at the report date. The estimate is a composite of a variety of factors including experience, collateral value, and the general economy. ALLL includes a specific portion, a formula driven portion, and a general nonspecific portion. The collection and ultimate recovery of the book value of the collateral, in most cases, is beyond our control.\nThe Company is also required to estimate the value of its MSR. The Company recognizes as separate assets rights to service fixed rate single-family mortgage loans that it has sold without recourse but services for others for a fee. Mortgage servicing assets are initially recorded at cost, based upon pricing multiples as determined by the purchaser, when the loans are sold. Mortgage servicing assets are carried at the lower of the initial carrying value, adjusted for amortization, or estimated fair value. Amortization is determined in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income using the level yield method. For purposes of determining impairment, the mortgage servicing assets are stratified into like groups based on loan type, term, new versus seasoned and interest rate. The valuation is completed by an independent third party.\nThe expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are the most significant factors driving the potential for the impairment of the value of mortgage servicing assets. Increases in mortgage loan prepayments reduce estimated future net servicing cash flows because the life of the underlying loan is reduced.\nThe Company's mortgage servicing rights relating to loans serviced for others represent an asset of the Company. This asset is initially capitalized and included in other assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The mortgage servicing rights are then amortized against noninterest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying mortgage servicing rights. There are a number of factors, however, that can affect the ultimate value of the mortgage servicing rights to the Company, including the estimated prepayment speed of the loan and the discount rate used to present value the servicing right. For example, if the mortgage loan is prepaid, the Company will receive fewer servicing fees, meaning that the present value of the mortgage servicing rights is less than the carrying value of those rights on the Company's balance sheet. Therefore, in an attempt to reflect an accurate expected value to the Company of the mortgage servicing rights, the Company\nreceives a valuation of its mortgage servicing rights from an independent third party. The independent third party's valuation of the mortgage servicing rights is based on relevant characteristics of the Company's loan servicing portfolio, such as loan terms, interest rates and recent national prepayment experience, as well as current national market interest rate levels, market forecasts and other economic conditions. Management, with the advice from its third party valuation firm, review the assumptions related to prepayment speeds, discount rates, and capitalized mortgage servicing income on a quarterly basis. Changes are reflected in the following quarter's analysis related to the mortgage servicing asset. In addition, based upon the independent third party's valuation of the Company's mortgage servicing rights, management then establishes a valuation allowance by each strata, if necessary, to quantify the likely impairment of the value of the mortgage servicing rights to the Company. The estimates of prepayment speeds and discount rates are inherently uncertain, and different estimates could have a material impact on the Company's net income and results of operations. The valuation allowance is evaluated and adjusted quarterly by management to reflect changes in the fair value of the underlying mortgage servicing rights based on market conditions. The accuracy of these estimates and assumptions by management and its third party can be directly tied back to the fact that management has not been required to record a valuation allowance through its income statement based upon the valuation of each stratum of serving rights.\nFor more information regarding the estimates and calculations used to establish the ALLL and the value of Mortgage Servicing Rights, please see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements provided herewith.\n2015 in Review\nThe Company experienced record earnings for 2015, with net income over a milestone of $10 million. Profitability improved due to the increased loan balances, new product offerings and continued strong asset quality. Net loans grew by $63.8 million with asset size increasing by a smaller $47.9 million. Loans were funded by higher deposit levels, sales and maturities of investment securities and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings.\nThe largest contributor to 2014's improved profitability was net interest income. For 2015, improvement in net interest income was just one factor of many. Lower loan provision and increased noninterest income were also major factors. 2015's bottom line was $694 thousand or 7.2% over 2014's. 2013 was bolstered by gain on sale of loans and securities which were a smaller part of 2014's and 2015's overall profitability.\nThe performance of our newest Sylvania office, which opened during the second half of 2014, exceeded our expectations and contributed profitably with its first year of operation. The Company continues to focus on expansion and our next office in Indiana is under construction with completion scheduled for end of first quarter 2016. Our location is situated within Huntertown but with a Fort Wayne address. We expect the office to be a slight drag on earnings during 2016 as a result of start-up costs, with great potential for later years.\nA deposit strategy to revamp the Bank's deposit mix was begun in the later part of 2014. The strategy included offering a new product line to checking and discontinuing some of the older products. An emphasis was on realigning our products to provide value to our depositors while building revenue or decreasing costs to the Bank. Secure checking and FM eXpress were two of the revamped or new offerings. This contributed to the almost $600 thousand improvement in customer service fees and other service charges and fees in noninterest income. The focus remains on growing core deposits and offering additional services. The success of this strategy is evidenced by the growth in core deposits along with increased debit card activity, on-line statement usage and lower cost of funds.\nShort-term rates increased slightly in December of 2015. The slope of the yield curve for most of 2015, enabled the Company to continue to sell investment securities with shorter term maturities and recognize a gain without compromising the yield. In prior years, the proceeds were mainly reinvested in the security portfolio while 2014's and 2015's proceeds were used to fund loan growth. For 2015, the recognized gain was $451 thousand, which was lower than 2014's $494 thousand and 2013's $775 thousand. The Bank was able to continue to capitalize on the steepness of the yield curve. The market value of the security portfolio has decreased as evidenced by the comprehensive income reported on the income statement. The Company will continue to look for opportunities to utilize the investment portfolio to fund loan growth.\nThroughout 2014 and 2015, the Company has done an exceptional job of recognizing opportunities to provide services and products that the low rate environment made possible. A commitment to improve asset quality over the years also benefited the Company during the period of 2012 through 2015. These opportunities are further discussed in the Material Changes in Results of Operations. The Company remains strong, stable and well capitalized and has the\ncapacity to continue to cover the increased costs of doing business in a tough economy while seeking good loans to improve profitability. The Company continues to look for new opportunities to generate and protect revenue while providing additional channels through which to serve our customers and maintain our high level of customer satisfaction.\nMaterial Changes in Results of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nThe discussion now centers on the individual line items of the consolidated statement of income and their effect on net income. This section will focus on the most traditional source of revenue contributing to the profitability of the Company, net interest income.\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets, such as interest bearing deposits and other borrowings. Net interest income is affected by changes in both interest rates and the amount and composition of earning assets and liabilities. The change in net interest income is most often measured as a result of two statistics - interest spread and net interest margin. The difference between the yields on earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities supporting those funds represents the interest spread. Because noninterest bearing sources of funds such as demand deposits and stockholders' equity also support earning assets, the net interest margin exceeds the interest spread.\nNet interest income showed an increase of $326 thousand in 2015 as compared to 2014 and an increase of $3.2 million when compared to 2013. Interest and fee income from loans were responsible for the improvement. Given that securities were sold to fund the loan growth, interest income from that balance sheet component has declined each of the last two years. Total interest income was $197 thousand higher for 2015 than 2014 and 2014 was $2.0 million higher than 2013.\nA trend of declining interest expense also positively impacted net interest income in terms of dollars. Two strategies employed during 2014 and 2015 were responsible. One was to allow expensive time deposit funds to run off and secondly to offer new non-interest bearing deposit products. The new secure checking product also caused some movement of existing funds out of interest bearing products to this new non-interest bearing account. Interest on deposits decreased $189 thousand in 2015 as compared to 2014 which followed a $735 thousand decrease for 2014 as compared to 2013. For 2015, total interest expense (which includes federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreement to repurchase, and borrowed funds) totaled $3.6 million which was down $129 thousand from 2014's $3.7 million. Total interest expense for 2014 was down $888 thousand from 2013's $4.6 million.\nThe success of 2015 and 2014 in improving net interest income confirmed that management's long term strategy of repositioning the balance sheet was the correct approach. Funding loan growth with internal funds, whether from the liquidation of investment securities or core deposits, was a beneficial move.\nOverall, we began to see an increase in the net interest margin and spread starting the fourth quarter of 2013 and the expansion continued throughout 2014 and lessened in 2015. The net interest margin decreased by 14 basis points during 2015 as compared to 2014 with the yield on interest earning assets the main factor. Loan volume was behind the improvement in interest income as the yield on the overall loan portfolio decreased 15 basis points during 2015. 2014 had already decreased by 10 basis points as compared to 2013. Decrease in loan yield was caused by a change in portfolio mix and by the lower repricing of loans. The only category of asset yield to increase was the short term federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits which was aided by the Federal Reserve increase in rates of 25 basis points in December 2015. Asset yield decreased 17 basis points in 2015 as compared to 2014 and was preceded by an increase of 39 basis points.\nCost of funds were nearing a half of one percent and ended at 0.54% for the average during 2015. This was down 1 basis point from 2014 and 2014 had been down 10 basis points from 2013. As mentioned previously, the movement of some of the interest bearing checking accounts greatly helped to decrease interest expense in terms of dollars; however, it also removed some of the lowest cost of funds out of the cost percentages. Therefore, the correlation to improvement in margin and spread is not easily visible.\nThe Company will always prefer to see improvement in real dollars over percentages. The strategy for increasing core deposits remains for 2016 for all the dollar reasons behind it to decrease interest expense and to continue to establish the opportunity for fee dollars from services provided.\nTotal assets of the Company increased overall as did the earning assets in both average and actual during 2015. This matched the movement in interest dollars, just not in yield. 2014 experienced just the opposite: a decrease in asset size and an improvement in yield. The earnings were over $2 million higher and the yield 39 basis points higher for 2014 as compared to 2013. The largest increase in balances and interest income was in the loan portfolio. One similarity between 2015 and 2014 was that loan volume was the driver to income improvement not rate. For 2015, the growth in loan volume yielded $2.2 million in interest income versus a decrease of $1.0 million due to rate. For 2014, the growth in the balances earned an amount higher at $3.7 million, than the $575 thousand given up due to lower yields on the portfolio as compared to 2013. The interest earning line item made up of investment securities had lower earnings in 2015 and 2014 than in 2013. Lower average balances, with the exception of tax-exempt investment securities, were the cause as the balances decreased to fund loan growth. The improvement in interest earnings from loan growth far outweighed the decreased earnings in the remaining earning assets for both 2015 and 2014.\nBefore switching to the interest expense discussion, a quick review of 2013's interest income will be summarized. 2014 was a reversal to the trends of previous years with its significant loan growth and higher interest earnings. During 2013 the Company experienced compression on the yield of earning assets.\nDuring 2013, earning assets increased during the year in actual and average balance. The interest collected on the earning assets decreased; with the yield decreasing as compared to 2012 in most portfolios. The largest decrease in yield occurred in the loans. 2013's loan growth occurred mainly in commercial real estate which pushed lower yields along with variable repricing continuing to price down. Investment securities had lower yields due to the large amount of calls on government sponsored agencies and the lower yield on new purchases. The portfolio decreased $3.1 million in average during 2013 as compared to 2012. It was not unusual for a called security to be replaced with a new security with a yield lower by 50 basis points or more. Overall, this portfolio's yield was 7 basis points lower in 2013 than in 2012.\nLoans, which have the highest earning asset yield, increased on average by $14.4 million from 2012 to 2013. The overall change in yield in the loan portfolio for 2013 and 2012 was due mainly to the change in rate. Given that the loan portfolio represented only 57.5% of the earning assets in 2013 as compared to 56% in 2012, it stands to reason that the overall asset yield decreased in every year since 2010 until 2014. The overall yield on earning assets decreased 24 basis points as compared to 2012. The higher ratio of loans to earning assets of 1.5% corresponded to a smaller decrease in the overall asset yield of 26 basis points between 2013 and 2012. This emphasizes how important and how significant an impact an increase in loan balances had on the Bank's profitability\nNet interest spread is the difference between what the Company earns on its assets and what it pays on its liabilities. It is generally from this spread that the Company must fund its operations and generate profit. When the asset yield decreases so must funding costs in order to maintain profitability. It becomes increasingly challenging as the asset yield gets closer to the prime lending rate, or the break-even point, of operations.\nWith respect to interest expense, a decrease in the cost is apparent for 2015 as compared to both 2014 and 2013. Fortunately, for 2014, both the interest factors of the net interest margin ratio improved to raise the margin by 48 basis points over 2013. Unfortunately, in 2015 and 2013, as compared to each preceding year, the asset yield decreased more than funding costs. As a result, both the net interest margin and spread decreased for both those periods as of 2015 and 2013.\nThe impact of the change in the portfolio mix was a factor in the liabilities as it was in the assets. Time deposits and other borrowed money term liabilities decreased in interest expense in comparing 2015 to 2014 and 2014 to 2013. Saving deposits increased in cost for 2015 as compared to 2014. Approximately two third's was due to balances increasing and the other one third due to rate. Fed Funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase increased for both 2015 and 2014. While 2014 was due to increased balance, 2015 was due to higher rates. Time deposits and other borrowed money both decreased in cost and balances during all three years presented. The Bank paid off $4.5 and $7.1 million of FHLB borrowings during 2014 and 2013 respectively. The Bank again borrowed $10 million in December 2015 to fund loan, growth. The average balance of other borrowed money was lower by $50 thousand for 2015 which calculated to $108 thousand. The average balance was $158 thousand for 2014 and a much higher $6.7 million for 2013.\nThe following tables present net interest income, interest spread and net interest margin for the three years 2013 through 2015, comparing average outstanding balances of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities with the associated interest income and expense. The tables show the corresponding average rates of interest earned and paid. The tax-exempt asset yields have been tax adjusted to reflect a marginal corporate tax rate of 34%. Average outstanding loan balances include non-performing loans and mortgage loans held for sale. Average outstanding security balances are computed based on carrying values including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities.\nThe percentage of interest earning assets to total assets increased to 92.8% in 2015 from 2014, preceded by a decrease to 89.1% in 2014 from 93.9% 2013. Noninterest earning assets increased during 2014 by $46.1 million as the earning credit rates paid by our correspondent banks were higher than the interest rates. The Bank switched those accounts to noninterest bearing to save costs which resulted in a lower percentage of interest earning assets.\nNoninterest bearing liabilities increased on average $9.7 million in 2015 over 2014, providing the lowest cost of funds possible. Movement in the Bank's deposits, specifically checking products, to the newer noninterest bearing \u201cPure\u201d and \u201cSecure\u201d checking product lines was the main driver.\nThe deposit strategy was implemented during 2014 to alter the deposit mix and introduce new products resulted in lower interest bearing liabilities. In average balances, 2014 had $41.3 million less than 2013 in interest bearing liabilities. \u201cSecure\u201d and \u201cPure\u201d checking were the main launches. Secure checking offers ID Protect along with credit score monitoring (reporting the score quarterly and providing notification of any access occurring) for a monthly charge. Pure provides depositors options to reduce or eliminate fees through modification of usage or having a total deposit relationship over a specified amount. The majority of the new offered accounts were noninterest bearing which caused the reduction in interest bearing liabilities. Time deposits also continued to run off during 2014 thereby reducing in average balance, by approximately $36.1 million as compared to 2013. The average cost of deposits also decreased 10 basis points, aided by the decrease in time deposits and payoff of all other borrowed money during 2014. The average cost of funds for 2015 was 0.54%, the average cost in 2014 for interest bearing liabilities was 0.55% compared to 0.65% in 2013.\nThe yield on Tax-Exempt investment securities shown in the following charts were computed on a tax equivalent basis. The yield on Loans has been tax adjusted for the portion of tax-exempt IDB loans included in the total. Total Interest Earning Assets is therefore also reflecting a tax equivalent yield in both line items, also with the Net Interest Spread and Margin. The adjustments were based on a 34% tax rate.\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

mentioned in the discussion earlier, in reviewing years 2014 to 2013, the change in volume is the main driver for the improved ratio which is opposite of the change between 2013 to 2012 the largest impact was due to rate. The strategy since 2010 has been to extend the maturities of time deposit \u201cspecials\u201d to over 24 months to prepare for a rising rate environment. The other strategy employed since 2011 was to increase core deposits by offering innovative products focused on customer needs, such as higher interest rates and fraud notification. In exchange for these\naccounts, customers were asked to utilize services that benefited both the Bank and themselves. Smaller time deposit rate shoppers had an option to perhaps change their behavior of banking or allow those deposits to run off. The new core deposit products were indeed embraced by our customers and have helped to attain the deposit portfolio mix sought by the Bank.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe discussion now turns to the noninterest activity of 2015 operations, beginning with the revenue portion. In comparing line items of the consolidated statements of income for years ended 2013 through 2015, it can be seen where the Company has been spending its time and the impact of the recession and slow recovery. This section will focus on the significant noninterest items that impacted the operations of the Company.\nThe Company has concerns with the increased costs associated with regulatory compliance such as the possible loss of revenue from new regulations stemming from the Dodd-Frank Act. History has proven the concern is justified. One area of revenue impacted was overdraft fees. Updated Regulation E guidelines were implemented on August 15, 2010 and the Bank has ended each year since with a lower revenue stream from overdraft fees. This has occurred in spite of the addition of the new offices since 2010. Each year, the number of checking accounts increased along with the balances; however average collected overdraft fees per account decreased. Overdraft fees in 2015 accounted for $2.4 million in noninterest income, compared to $2.5 million in 2014 and $2.7 million for 2013. The Bank had made this an area of focus for 2015 as this revenue stream remains under intense regulator review. In 2015, the Bank adjusted its overdraft program and renamed it \u201cCourtesy Pay\u201d. Courtesy Pay establishes dynamic limits based on a customer's behavior and likelihood of repayment. The Bank has sought to better service the customer's needs while decreasing the need for collections and improving profitability. At the current time, profitability has not been impacted. Service charges on checking accounts, excluding Health Savings Accounts, were up $120 thousand for 2015 and $208.7 thousand for 2014. This improvement is credited to the new checking accounts mentioned previously.\nThe Bank has long promoted the use of debit cards by its customers and continued that philosophy with the introduction of additional new products. 2015 revenue improved $142.9 thousand and 2014 revenue improved $250.5 from ATM/debit card usage as compared to 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Bank receives interchange revenue from each use by a customer of the card. In 2011, this revenue stream was at risk of being reduced by the Federal Reserve regulation of the interchange fee. The establishment by the Federal Reserve of a tiered pricing for banks under $10 billion has helped to protect the profitability from such fees, although the concern remains as to how long this tiered pricing will remain in effect. While this revenue stream continues to improve with more depositors using electronic methods for purchasing, the expense of fraud has offset a portion of the revenue gain. Further discussion can be found in the non-interest expense section regarding the net effect of debit card activity.\nNoninterest income from net gain on sales of loans decreased for both 2015 and 2014 as compared to 2013. Unfortunately, this has become a trend mainly due to the duration of the flat rate interest environment. The net gain on sale of loans is derived from sales of real estate loans into the secondary market. Of these loan types, the Bank sells 100% of the residential loans and 90% of the agricultural loans into the secondary market. 2014 or 2015 activity did not reach the same high levels as 2013. Gains of $559.6 and $140.8 thousand were recorded for residential and agricultural real estate respectively for 2015 along with gains of $452.7 and $194.3 thousand were recorded for residential and agricultural real estate respectively for 2014. In conjunction with these sales, the Bank maintains servicing rights and those income amounts during all three years are included in the customer service fees line item and account for over $300 thousand in revenue each year.\nThe last line item in the noninterest income section as was discussed previously is the net gain on sale of investments. The Bank has taken advantage of this opportunity the last three years and expects to continue as long as the rates remain low and the yield curve is favorable to the transaction. The Bank will not increase short-term gains at the sacrifice of long-term profitability. All of the sales of securities in 2015 and 2014 of $47.0 and $57.9 million respectively were used to fund loan growth while only some of the $91 million in proceeds realized on the sale of securities in 2013 were used to fund loan growth. This is a source of funds that will continue to be analyzed for use in the coming year. Gains of $451 thousand were recorded for 2015, $494 thousand for 2014 as compared to $775 thousand for 2013.\nCustomer service fees show a nice improvement of $623 thousand collected in 2015 as compared to 2014. Almost $200 thousand can be attributed to classifying foreign ATM fees out of service charges into miscellaneous fees in 2015. An additional $104.7 thousand comes from servicing those sold secondary loans mentioned in gain on sale of loans, as the volume increased in 2015 as compared to 2014. Total loan service fees collected in 2015 was $1.2 million compared to $1.1 million in 2014.\nOverall, noninterest income increased $604 thousand in 2015 following a year where it had decreased $654 thousand. Some of the revenue may not be easily duplicated as it is dependent on economic and market conditions to provide the opportunity. However, the increased revenue amounts from deposit and loan services should continue to provide improved profitability in the future. Gains on sales should also continue in the near term though when it will change is unknown at this time.\nNon-Interest Expense\nNoninterest expense increased 3.4% in 2015 as compared to 2014 and was preceded by a 4.2% increase in 2014 as compared to 2013. Represented in dollars, 2015 was $854 thousand higher than 2014 and 2014 was $1 million higher than 2013. The largest factor behind both years increase was the expense of employee salaries and wages. During 2015, an additional $721 thousand was spent over 2014 which correlates to a 7.1% increase. When making the same analysis for 2014 as compared to 2013, 2014's costs increased $633 thousand or 6.6%. Three main components flow into salaries and wages: base salary, deferred costs, and incentives composed of the expense of restricted stock awards and performance incentives. Base pay has increased with the addition of the three offices of Waterville, Custar and Sylvania, the Captive and through normal yearly increases to the remainder of the employees. Base pay was up $559.3 thousand for 2015 over the previous year and 2014 was up $474.1 thousand over 2013. The full time equivalent number of employees at each yearend increased to 265 for 2015, to 260 for 2014 compared to 2013's 251.\nIncentive pay as it related to performance was up $209.5 thousand in 2014 over 2013. Both measurements used to award incentive pay had improved in 2015 and 2014 and employees benefited accordingly. These followed 2013, a year in which the incentive performance pay was down $110.1 thousand from 2012. The expense for the restricted stock awards has also increased each of the last three years as more shares have been granted to a larger number of employees. 2015's cost for this program was $82 thousand higher than 2014 and 2014 was $20.9 thousand higher than 2013. The awards incorporate a three year vesting period so the increase of any one year carries forward through the next two years. This expense should continue to increase as the Company continues its expansion strategy. (For further discussion in incentive pay and restricted stock awards, see note 11 of the consolidated financial statements.)\nEmployee benefits increased by similar percentages as the salaries and wages for 2015 increased by 6.9% over 2014 and 2014 increased by 3.3% over 2013. The cost of the 401-K retirement plan increased each year as the profit share component increased along with the number of employees participating. The Company has been able to hold steady the expense of the employee's group insurance while paying higher premiums. Being partially self-insured has helped with lower claim experience though it is an unknown each year what that experience will be. For 2014 and 2015, a switch in the medical provider and comparison pricing also assisted to control the cost. Employees do participate in any premium increases.\nNet occupancy expense typically increases as the Company expands, with 2014 being an exception due to an increase in building rent. Building rent is netted out to offset occupancy expense. The greatest contributor to building rent comes from the division of FM Investments within the Bank. This division experienced a strong 2014; however the department was short staffed most of 2015. This has been remedied in 2016 and performance is expected to improve.\nWhile net loss on sale of other assets owned, mainly ORE property, does not represent income for the years presented, the decrease in the amount of the loss for 2015 as compared to 2014, does contribute to improved profitability. Loss on sale of assets included any write downs in the carrying values of ORE property on the Bank's balance sheet. In 2015 and 2014, the number of properties and the corresponding carrying values decreased as compared to 2013. The Bank also sold its St. Joe, Indiana property during 2015. While taking a loss for the sale, the Bank eliminated the continued maintenance expense of an unoccupied building. An easement was agreed upon to enable the ATM located on the property to remain operational.\nThe mortgage refinancing activity has been lower over the last three years. A correlating expense to that activity is the amortization of mortgage servicing rights. The amortization is the expense that offsets the income recognized when the loan is first made. Income is recorded when the mortgage loan is first sold with servicing retained and is therefore recognized within one year. The amortization, however, is calculated over the life of the loan and accelerated as loans are paid off early. An increase in this expense can be driven by two activities: an increase in the number of sold loans and/or by the acceleration of the expense from payoff and refinance activity. The best picture of the bottom line impact is achieved by netting the income with the expense each year. 2015 had net income of $33 thousand, a switch from\n2014 which had net expense of $42.7 thousand and 2013 had a net income of $2 thousand. Of course, the value (or income) of the mortgage servicing right when sold also impacts the net position. 2015 had higher additions and lower amortization expense from refinanced loans. 2013 had new loan activity and lower refinance activity making the additions and amortization almost equal. The number of loans and balances also indicates this as the levels have remained fairly constant. 2014 was a year with limited sales and the amortization expense was therefore higher than the capitalized additions. As of December 2015, 3,598 loans are being serviced with balances of $275.7 million. As of December 31, 2014, there were 3,638 loans serviced with balances of $275.4 million and as of December 2013, there were 3,684 loans serviced with balances of $282.1 million.\nThe impact of mortgage servicing rights to both noninterest income and expense is shown in the following table:\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In Thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,066 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,063 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capitalized Additions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>429 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(374 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(344 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(426 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Valuation Allowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> End of Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,056 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,066 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Furniture and equipment steadily increases as we continue to add facilities and invest in technology. Annual maintenance costs continue to grow and become a greater piece of the overall cost. As new services are provided to our customers, the backroom cost to supply them continues to rise. The Company accepts it is an expected cost of doing business and keeping our services relevant to the industry.\nData processing expense increased $50 thousand during 2015 and by $38 thousand in 2014. The Company continues to investigate ways to reduce this expense. The pricing on many services, however, is based on number of accounts and the Bank fully expects those to increase with the growth from the newer offices and overall Bank growth.\nThe last line item with significant variation in noninterest expense to discuss is \u201cother general and administrative\u201d. The decrease of $348 thousand for 2015 as compared to 2014 can be mainly attributed to a $195.7 thousand reduction in marketing and consulting costs. A renegotiation of one service provider contract along with the maturity of another during 2015 lead to the decrease. Another contributor to the reduction was lower losses due to NSF and fraud. The Bank applauds the work of our front-line staff to recognize possible fraud and scams attempted on our customers and stopping them before they can occur. An investment in additional fraud detection software has also helped our back office personnel to detect possible digital fraud. This was down $60.2 thousand in 2015 compared to an increase in 2014 of $40.9 thousand.\nOther general and administrative was higher by $461 thousand in 2014. The fluctuation was not isolated to a single source. The primary factors impacting this fluctuation in 2014 are increases in both ATM expense and core deposit intangible expenses. The increased expense of $52.7 thousand relating to ATM and debit cards in 2015 and 2014 over the previous year is caused by many factors. Increased usage during both years corresponds to increases in both revenue and cost. Finally, fraud increases cost as new cards have to be issued to limit the risk exposure. The fraud losses themselves are not recognized in this breakout, however the cost of replacement cards is. The Bank is currently deploying chip technology within its cards; the Bank is aware the adoption of embedded chips will increase this expense in the coming years. 2014 experienced additional expense over 2013 in consulting ($161.7 thousand), audit and accounting fees ($166.5 thousand) and advertising ($101.3 thousand).\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nProvision expense decreased by $566 thousand for 2015, following an increase of $333 thousand for 2014. The decrease for 2015 was due to the consistent strong asset quality of the Bank's loan portfolio as evidenced by low levels of both net charge-offs and delinquencies. The increase for 2014 was needed to account for the loan growth and the net charge-off activity of 2014. Sustained strong asset quality kept the provision expense lower than the growth alone would have warranted. Net charge-offs were $473, $480 and $888 thousand for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Commercial and Industrial loans had the largest charge-off activity in 2015 and 2013, while 2014 was impacted with higher levels in the consumer portfolios.\nThe Company segregates its Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) into two reserves: The ACL and the Allowance for Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit (AULC). When combined, these reserves constitute the total ACL. The AUCL is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Bank's ALLL methodology captures trends in leading, current, and lagging indicators which will directly affect the Bank's allocation amount. The Bank monitors trends in such leading indicators as delinquency, unemployment changes in the Bank's service area, experience and ability of staff, regulatory trends, and credit concentrations. A current indicator such as the total watch list loan amount to Capital, and a lagging indicator such as the charge off amount are referenced as well. A matrix formed by loan type from these indicators is used in making ALLL adjustments.\nWatch list loan balances are comprised of loans graded 5-8. These loan balances decreased 53.6% or $7.2 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. The balances decreased mainly due to successful results from collection efforts. Given the size of the decrease, it is no surprise it is attributed mainly to the commercial real estate portfolio decreasing by $5.9 million. Three customers made up the bulk of the balances with one of three finding funding elsewhere. Commercial loans (non-real estate) on the Bank's watch list also had a nice decrease during 2015, though just not as high at $1.9 million.\nOf the aggregate watch list loan balances, as of December 31, 2015, special mention accounted for 36.6% with substandard comprising 49.1% and doubtful accounting for the final 14.3%. In comparison to 2014, special mention was down $7.2 million, substandard up slightly by $161 thousand and doubtful down almost exactly the same amount at $162 thousand.\nSpecial mention loan balances increased 21.2% or $1.7 million overall as of yearend 2014 compared to same date 2013. The increase was in the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios. The largest increase of $2.1 million was in the commercial real estate, which was caused mainly by one large relationship being downgraded. Agricultural real estate decreased $618 thousand, thereby offsetting the above-referenced increase.\nFor 2014, the increase in special mention is offset by significant decreases in the substandard classifications of those same commercial related portfolios. Overall, substandard and doubtful loans decreased 42.5% or $2.9 million as compared to yearend 2013. In response to these fluctuations and loan growth during 2014 and 2015, the Bank changed ALLL to outstanding loan coverage percentage changed to 0.88% as of December 31, 2015, 0.95% as of December 31, 2014 from and 0.90% as of December 31, 2013.\nThe above indicators are reviewed quarterly. Some of the indicators are quantifiable and, as such, will automatically adjust the ALLL once calculated. These indicators include the ratio of past due loans to total loans, loans past due greater than 30 days, and the ration of watch list loans to capital, with the watch list made up of loans graded 5, 6 or 7 on a scale of 1 (best) to 7 (worst). Other indicators use more subjective data to the extent possible to evaluate the potential for inherent losses in the Bank's loan portfolio. For example, the economic indicator uses the unemployment statistics from the communities in our market area to help determine whether the ALLL should be adjusted. At the end of each of 2013, 2014 and 2015, a slight improvement was noted in unemployment figures.\nAll aggregate commercial and agricultural credits including real estate loans of $250,000 and over are reviewed annually by both credit committees and internal loan review to look for early signs of deterioration.\nTo establish the specific reserve allocation for real estate, a discount to the market value is established to account for liquidation expenses. The discounting percentage used for real estate mirrors the discounting of real estate as provided for in the Bank's Loan Policy. However, unique or unusual circumstances may be present which will affect the real estate value and, when appropriately identified, can adjust the discounting percentage at the discretion of management.\nThe ACL increased $153 and $755 thousand during 2015 and 2014 respectively, which was preceded by a $29 thousand decrease during 2013. The large increase in 2014 directly correlates to the large increase in loan balances. With the improved asset quality, the metrics upon which the ACL is calculated did not support a larger increase in 2015 even though loan growth occurred. The percentage of ACL to the total loan portfolio was 0.93% as of December 31, 2013, 0.98% as of December 31, 2014 and 0.91% as of December 31, 2015. December 31, 2013 had the lowest loans past due 30+ day percentage at 0.25% in the Bank's known history, December 31, 2014 and 2015 were still at respectable lows of 0.37% and 0.32%.\nPlease see Note 4 in the consolidated financial statement for additional tables regarding the composition of the ACL.\nFederal Income Taxes\nEffective tax rates were 26.97%, 28.64% and 28.53% for 2015, 2014 and 2013 respectively. The effect of tax-exempt interest from holding tax-exempt securities and Industrial Development Bonds (IDBs) was $554, $634, and $640 thousand for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. All years included an increase into a higher tax bracket for income over $10 million. Behind the decrease in 2015 is one of the benefits from the establishment of the Captive subsidiary.\nMaterial Changes in Financial Condition\nThe shifts in the balance sheet during 2015 and 2014 have positioned the Company for continued improvement in profitability. On the asset side, the Company experiences an increase in interest income due to loan growth with funding provided by a decrease in the investment portfolio, core deposit growth and 2015 also utilized other borrowings. The cost of funds was impacted by the shift of interest bearing liabilities to noninterest and the decrease in time deposits and other borrowed money as borrowings didn't increase until December 2015. Both contributed to improved profitability in 2015 and 2014 and leads to expected liabilities improvement in future years.\nAverage earning assets increased throughout 2015 and 2014. Loan growth in both years was the main factor. 2014 was also aided by the Custar acquisition which took place in December 2013 and brought in $29 million in deposits. 2015 also had the addition of the Sylvania office for a full year along with the growth in the other newer offices.\nSecurities\nThe investment portfolio is primarily used to provide overall liquidity for the Bank. It is also used to provide required collateral for pledging to the Bank's Ohio public depositors for amounts on deposit in excess of the FDIC coverage limits. It may also be used to pledge for additional borrowings from third parties. Investments are made with the above criteria in mind while still seeking a fair market rate of return, and looking for maturities that fall within the projected overall strategy of the Bank.

The largest segment of holdings is in US Governments. The Bank also holds stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati at a cost of $3.7 million. This is required in order to obtain Federal Home Loan Bank loans. The Bank also owns stock of Farmer Mac with a carrying value of $37.4 thousand which is required to participate loans in the program.\nLoan Portfolio\nThe Bank's various loan portfolios are subject to varying levels of credit risk. Management mitigates these risks through portfolio diversification and through standardization of lending policies and procedures.\nRisks are mitigated through an adherence to the Bank's loan policies, with any exception being recorded and approved by senior management or committees comprised of senior management. The Bank's loan policies define parameters to essential underwriting guidelines such as loan-to-value ratio, cash flow and debt-to-income ratio, loan requirements and covenants, financial information tracking, collection practice and others. The maximum loan amount to any one borrower is limited by the Bank's legal lending limits and is stated in policy. On a broader basis, the Bank restricts total aggregate funding in comparison to Bank capital to any one business or agricultural sector by an approved sector percentage to capital limitation.\nThe

irregularly or at less than original contractual rates. Interest income that would have been recorded under the original terms of these loans would have aggregated $117.1 thousand for 2015, $52.3 thousand for 2014 and $139.1 thousand for 2013. Any collections of interest on nonaccrual loans are included in interest income when collected unless it is on an impaired loan with a specific allocation. A collection of interest on an impaired loan with a specific allocation is applied to the loan balance to decrease the allocation. Total interest collections, whether on an accrued or cash basis, amounted to $76 thousand for 2015, $87 thousand for 2014 and $60 thousand for 2013. $20.6 thousand of interest collected in 2015 was applied to reduce the specific allocation and was applied for the same reason in 2014.\nLoans are placed on nonaccrual status in the event that the loan is in past due status for more than 90 days or payment in full of principal and interest is not expected. The Bank had nonaccrual loan balances of $2.1 million at December 31, 2015 compared to balances of $3.3 and $1.7 million as of year-end 2013 and 2014, respectively. All of the balances of nonaccrual loans for the past three years were collaterally secured.\nAs of December 31, 2015 the Bank had $7.0 million of loans which it considers to be \u201cpotential problem loans\u201d in that the borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties. At December 31, 2014, the Bank had $13.5 million of these loans. These loans are subject to constant management attention and are reviewed at least monthly. The amount of the potential problem loans was considered in management's review of the loan loss reserve at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nIn extending credit to families, businesses and governments, banks accept a measure of risk against which an allowance for possible loan loss is established by way of expense charges to earnings. This expense is determined by management based on a detailed monthly review of the risk factors affecting the loan portfolio, including general economic conditions, changes in the portfolio mix, past due loan-loss experience and the financial condition of the bank's borrowers.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Bank had loans outstanding to individuals and firms engaged in the various fields of agriculture in the amount of $82.8 million with an additional $58.5 million in agricultural real estate loans these compared to $74.6 and $50.9 million respectively as of December 31, 2014. The ratio of this segment of loans to the total loan portfolio is not considered unusual for a bank engaged in and servicing rural communities.\nInterest rate modification to reflect a decrease in market interest rates or maintain a relationship with the debtor, where the debtor is not experiencing financial difficulty and can obtain funding from other sources, is not considered a troubled debt restructuring. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank had $1.1 million of its loans that were classified as troubled debt restructurings, of which $182.4 thousand are included in non-accrual loans. This compares to $797.2 thousand as of same date 2014 and the Bank had almost $911.2 thousand classified as such as of December 31, 2013.\nUpdated appraisals are required on all collateral dependent loans once they are deemed impaired. The Bank may also require an updated appraisal of a watch list loan which the Bank monitors under their loan policy. On a quarterly basis, Bank management reviews properties supporting asset dependent loans to consider market events that may indicate a change in value has occurred.\nTo determine observable market price, collateral asset values securing an impaired loan are periodically evaluated. Maximum time of re-evaluation is every 12 months for chattels and titled vehicles and every two years for real estate. In this process, third party evaluations are obtained and heavily relied upon. Until such time that updated appraisals are received, the Bank may discount the existing collateral value used.\nPerforming \u201cnon-watch list\u201d loans secured in whole or in part by real estate, do not require an updated appraisal unless the loan is rewritten and additional funds advanced. Watch List loans secured in whole or in part by real estate require updated appraisals every two years. All loans are subject to loan to values as found in the Bank's loan policies irrespective of their grade. The Bank's watch list is reviewed on a quarterly basis by management and any questions to value are addressed at that time.\nThe majority of the Bank's loans are made in the market by lenders who live and work in the market. Thus, their evaluation of the independent valuation is also valuable and serves as a double check.\nOn extremely rare occasions, the Bank will make adjustments to the recorded values of collateral securing commercial real estate loans without acquiring an updated appraisal for the subject property. The Bank has no formalized policy for determining when collateral value adjustments between regularly scheduled appraisals are necessary, nor does it use any specific methodology for applying such adjustments. However, on a quarterly basis as part of its normal operations, the Bank's senior management and the Loan Review Committee will meet to review all commercial credits either deemed to be impaired or on the Bank's watch list. In addition to analyzing the recent performance of these loans, management and the Enterprise Risk Management Committee will also consider any general market conditions that might warrant adjustments to the value of particular real estate collateralizing commercial loans. In addition, management conducts annual reviews of all commercial loans exceeding certain outstanding balance thresholds. In each of these situations, any information available to management regarding market conditions impacting a specific property or other relevant factors are considered, and lenders familiar with a particular commercial real estate loan and the underlying collateral may be present to provide their opinion on such factors. If the available information leads management to conclude a valuation adjustment is warranted, such an adjustment may be applied on the basis of the information available. If management concludes that an adjustment is warranted but lacks the specific information needed to reasonably quantify the adjustment, management will order a new appraisal on the subject property even though one may not be required under the Bank's general policies for updating appraisal.\nNote 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements may also be reviewed for additional tables dealing with the Bank's loans and ALLL.\nALLL is evaluated based on an assessment of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio. This assessment results in an allowance consisting of two components, allocated and unallocated.\nManagement considers several different risk assessments in determining ALLL. The allocated component of ALLL reflects expected losses resulting from an analysis of individual loans, developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and historical loss experience for each loan category. For those loans where the internal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification and management can reasonably estimate the loss that will be sustained based upon collateral, the borrowers operating activity and economic conditions in which the borrower operates, a specific allocation is made. For those borrowers that are not currently behind in their payment, but for which management believes, based on economic conditions and operating activities of the borrower, the possibility exists for future collection problems, a reserve is established. The amount of reserve allocated to each loan portfolio is based on past loss experiences and the different levels of risk within each loan portfolio. The historical loan loss portion is determined using a historical loss analysis by loan category.\nThe unallocated portion of the reserve for loan losses is determined based on management's assessment of general economic conditions as well as specific economic factors in the Bank's marketing area. This assessment inherently involves a higher degree of uncertainty. It represents estimated inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio that are probable due to uncertainties in economic conditions, delays in obtaining information, including unfavorable information about a borrower's financial condition and other current risk factors that may not have yet manifested themselves in the Bank's historical loss factors used to determine the allocated component of the allowance.\nActual charge-off of loan balances is based upon periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio by management. These evaluations consider several factors, including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, financial condition of the borrower, and collateral.\nAs presented below, charge-offs increased to $1.0 million for 2015, preceded by a decrease to $778 thousand for 2014, an increase to $1.3 million for 2013, decreased to $891 thousand for 2012 and 2011 recorded $2.7 million. The provision expense also decreased in 2012 and 2011 and increased for 2013 and 2014. 2015 had the lowest provision expense of all years presented at $625 thousand. 2014 and 2013 had provision expense of $1.2 million and $858 thousand respectively. 2012 had provision expense of $738 thousand with 2011 having provision expense of $1.7 million. The Commercial and Industrial portfolio had the largest net charge-off position in 2011 through 2015. The improvement in asset quality during the periods shown is reflected in the increased percentage of the allowance for loan loss to nonperforming loans.\nIn reviewing the bigger picture of the allowance for credit loss, the years with the higher percentage of ACL to total nonperforming loans ratio account for the lower level of nonaccrual and watch list loans. This demonstrates the extended time period with which it has taken to achieve resolution and/or collection of these loans. In 2012, the provision expense was to offset the higher year-end watch list values. A smaller portion of the allowance was needed to fund the impaired loans as collateral remained sufficient to cover the outstanding amounts in most cases. 2014's significant and continued loan growth since fourth quarter 2013 was the reason behind 2014's higher balances as asset quality remained strong. The ratio of ACL to nonperforming loans increased significantly in 2014 which is why provision loan expense was lower in 2015 in comparison. The ACL to nonperforming loans for 2015 remained more than adequate and emphasizes the existing strong level of credit quality.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the allowance for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011:\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

investment portfolio to fund loans. The Bank has access to $58 million of unsecured borrowings through correspondent banks and $29.4 million of unpledged securities which may be sold or used as collateral. An additional $4.1 million is also available from the Federal Home Loan Bank based on current collateral pledging with up to $118.5 million available provided adequate collateral is pledged.\nMaintaining sufficient funds to meet depositor and borrower needs on a daily basis continues to be among management's top priorities. This is accomplished not only by immediate liquid resources of cash, due from banks and federal funds sold, but also by the Bank's available for sale securities portfolio. The average aggregate balance of these assets was $262.1 for 2015 and $296.5 million for 2014, and $387.7 million for 2013. This represented 28.0%, 31.8% and 42.5% of total average assets, respectively. Of the almost $218.7 million of debt securities in the bank's portfolio as of December 31, 2015, $12.7 million, or 5.8% of the portfolio, is expected to receive payments or mature in 2016. The availability of the funds may be reduced by the need to utilize securities for pledging purposes on public deposits. This liquidity provides the opportunity to fund loan growth by analysis of the lowest cost and source of funds whether by increasing deposits, sales or runoff of investments or utilizing debt.\nIn addition to the Bank's investment portfolio, the Company has $16.4 million held in the holding company's investment portfolio. $1.5 million of those investments will mature or receive payments in the next twelve months. These funds provide liquidity to the Company. The Bank has been declaring additional dividends each quarter to provide this liquidity to the Company. In future years, the Captive will also upstream dividends to the Company once reserve levels are adequately provided for. This will also provide additional liquidity for Company activities.\nHistorically, the primary source of liquidity has been core deposits that include noninterest bearing and interest bearing demand deposits, savings, money market accounts and time deposits of individuals. Core deposit balances as of year-end 2015 increased in all categories with the exception of time deposits. Overall deposits increased an average of $2.6 million in 2015, $913 thousand in 2014 and $4.7 million during 2013. The Bank also utilized Federal Funds purchased at times during 2013 through 2015. The average balance for 2015 and 2014 was $1.2 million and $1.4 million respectively. The Bank began using this temporary funding source heavier in December 2015 while it secured more permanent funding.\nHistorically, the primary use of new funds is placing the funds back into the community through loans for the acquisition of new homes, consumer products and for business development. The use of new funds for loans is measured by the loan to deposit ratio. The Bank's average loan to deposit ratio was 80.7% for 2015, 76.4% for 2014 and 66.2% for 2013. The lower ratio in 2013 was due to the success of the deposit gathering function, the residential mortgage loans being sold in the secondary market and the lack of loan demand. The Bank's goal is for this ratio to be higher in the 80-90 percent range with loan growth being the driver. The Bank ended the year 2015 at an 88.1% loan to deposit ratio.\nShort-term debt such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase also provides the Company with liquidity. Short-term debt for both federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase amounted to $78.8 million at the end of 2015 compared to $56.0 million at the end of 2014 and $69.8 million at the end of 2013. These accounts are used to provide a sweep product to the Bank's commercial customers.\n\u201cOther borrowings\u201d are also a source of funds. Other borrowings consist of loans from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati. These funds are then used to provide loans in our community. The Bank utilized this funding source in December 2015 by borrowing $10 million. Prior borrowings from this source had decreased by $4.5 million to none at December 31, 2014. This compares to decreased borrowings during 2013 of $7.1 million. The decreased borrowings were payoffs of matured notes in 2013 and 2014.\nAsset/Liability Management\nThe primary functions of asset/liability management are to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. It involves the management of the balance sheet mix, maturities, re-pricing characteristics and pricing components to provide an adequate and stable net interest margin with an acceptable level of risk. Interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates.\nChanges in net income, other than those related to volume arise when interest rates on assets re-price in a time frame or interest rate environment that is different from that of the re-pricing period for liabilities. Changes in net interest income also arise from changes in the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nHistorically, the Bank has maintained liquidity through cash flows generated in the normal course of business, loan repayments, maturing earning assets, the acquisition of new deposits, and borrowings. The Bank's asset and liability management program is designed to maximize net interest income over the long term while taking into consideration both credit and interest rate risk. Interest rate sensitivity varies with different types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Overnight federal funds on which rates change daily and loans that are tied to the market rate differ considerably from long-term investment securities and fixed rate loans. Similarly, time deposits over $100,000 and money market certificates are much more interest rate sensitive than passbook savings accounts. The Bank utilizes shock analysis to examine the amount of exposure an instant rate change of 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points in both increasing and decreasing directions would have on the financials. Acceptable ranges of earnings and equity at risk are established and decisions are made to maintain those levels based on the shock results.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the Company's operations. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all the assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Company's performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and service.\nContractual Obligations\nContractual Obligations of the Company totaled $252.1 million as of December 31, 2015. Time deposits represent contractual agreements for certificates of deposits held by its customers. Long term debt represents the borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank and is further defined in Note 4 and 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Due by Period (In Thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities sold under agreement to repurchase\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89,862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>844 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividends Payable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long Term Debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>252,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>844 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Capital Resources\nStockholders' equity was $120.1 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to $114.5 million at December 31, 2014. Dividends declared during 2015 were $0.87 per share totaling $3.99 million and during 2014 were $0.84 per share totaling $3.86 million. During 2015, the Company purchased 30,685 shares and awarded 16,000 shares of restricted stock to 67 employees. During 2014, the Company purchased 23,570 shares and awarded 13,250 restricted shared to 61 employees. For a summary of activity as it relates to the Company's restricted stock awards, please refer to Note 11: Employee Benefit Plans in the consolidated financial statements. At yearend 2015, the Company held 587,466 shares in Treasury stock and 38,995 unvested shares of restricted stock. At yearend 2014, the Company held 572,662 shares in Treasury stock and 33,390 unvested shares of restricted stock. On January 15, 2016 the Company announced the authorization by its Board of Directors for the Company's repurchase, either on the open market, or in privately negotiated transactions, of up to 200,000 shares of its outstanding common stock commencing January 15, 2016 and ending December 31, 2016. The Company has a history of approving a similar resolution to be in effect each year for at least the last five years.\nThe Company continues to have a strong capital base and maintains regulatory capital ratios that are above the defined regulatory capital ratios. At December 31, 2015, the Bank and the Company had total risk-based capital ratios of 12.64% and 14.95%, respectively. Core capital to risk-based asset ratios of 11.87% and 14.18% for the Bank and the Company, respectively, are well in excess of regulatory guidelines. The Bank's leverage ratio of 10.12% is also substantially in excess of regulatory guidelines, as is the Company's at 11.91%. Under Basel III, the common equity Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets ratios are also well above the required 4.50% and the 6.50% well capitalized levels with the Company at 14.18% and the Bank at 11.87%. For further discussion and analysis of regulatory capital requirements, refer to Note 15 of the Audited Financial Statements.\nThe Company's subsidiaries are restricted by regulations from making dividend distributions in excess of certain prescribed amounts. Upon prior regulatory approval, the Bank may be allowed to pay above the prescribed amount.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and the Company follows general practices within the financial services industry in which it operates. At times the application of these principles requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These assumptions, estimates and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. As this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different assumptions, estimates and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on assumptions, estimates and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Examples of critical assumptions, estimates and judgments are when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not required to be recorded at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability must be recorded contingent upon a future event.\nAll significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued and how those values are determined for the financial statements. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to assumptions, estimates and judgments underlying those amounts, management has identified the determination of the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) and the valuation of its Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) and Other Real Estate Owned (ORE) as the accounting areas that requires the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be the most subject to revision as new information becomes available.\nAssets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nThe ALLL represents management's estimate of credit losses inherent in the Bank's loan portfolio at the report date. The estimate is a composite of a variety of factors including experience, collateral value, and the general economy. ALLL includes a specific portion, a formula driven portion, and a general nonspecific portion. The collection and ultimate recovery of the book value of the collateral, in most cases, is beyond our control.\nThe Company is also required to estimate the value of its MSR. The Company recognizes as separate assets rights to service fixed rate single-family mortgage loans that it has sold without recourse but services for others for a fee. Mortgage servicing assets are initially recorded at cost, based upon pricing multiples as determined by the purchaser, when the loans are sold. Mortgage servicing assets are carried at the lower of the initial carrying value, adjusted for amortization, or estimated fair value. Amortization is determined in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income using the level yield method. For purposes of determining impairment, the mortgage servicing assets are stratified into like groups based on loan type, term, new versus seasoned and interest rate. The valuation is completed by an independent third party.\nThe expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are the most significant factors driving the potential for the impairment of the value of mortgage servicing assets. Increases in mortgage loan prepayments reduce estimated future net servicing cash flows because the life of the underlying loan is reduced.\nThe Company's mortgage servicing rights relating to loans serviced for others represent an asset of the Company. This asset is initially capitalized and included in other assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The mortgage servicing rights are then amortized against noninterest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying mortgage servicing rights. There are a number of factors, however, that can affect the ultimate value of the mortgage servicing rights to the Company, including the estimated prepayment speed of the loan and the discount rate used to present value the servicing right. For example, if the mortgage loan is prepaid, the Company will receive fewer servicing fees, meaning that the present value of the mortgage servicing rights is less than the carrying value of those rights on the Company's balance sheet. Therefore, in an attempt to reflect an accurate expected value to the Company of the mortgage servicing rights, the Company\nreceives a valuation of its mortgage servicing rights from an independent third party. The independent third party's valuation of the mortgage servicing rights is based on relevant characteristics of the Company's loan servicing portfolio, such as loan terms, interest rates and recent national prepayment experience, as well as current national market interest rate levels, market forecasts and other economic conditions. Management, with the advice from its third party valuation firm, review the assumptions related to prepayment speeds, discount rates, and capitalized mortgage servicing income on a quarterly basis. Changes are reflected in the following quarter's analysis related to the mortgage servicing asset. In addition, based upon the independent third party's valuation of the Company's mortgage servicing rights, management then establishes a valuation allowance by each strata, if necessary, to quantify the likely impairment of the value of the mortgage servicing rights to the Company. The estimates of prepayment speeds and discount rates are inherently uncertain, and different estimates could have a material impact on the Company's net income and results of operations. The valuation allowance is evaluated and adjusted quarterly by management to reflect changes in the fair value of the underlying mortgage servicing rights based on market conditions. The accuracy of these estimates and assumptions by management and its third party can be directly tied back to the fact that management has not been required to record a valuation allowance through its income statement based upon the valuation of each stratum of serving rights.\nFor more information regarding the estimates and calculations used to establish the ALLL and the value of Mortgage Servicing Rights, please see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements provided herewith.\n2015 in Review\nThe Company experienced record earnings for 2015, with net income over a milestone of $10 million. Profitability improved due to the increased loan balances, new product offerings and continued strong asset quality. Net loans grew by $63.8 million with asset size increasing by a smaller $47.9 million. Loans were funded by higher deposit levels, sales and maturities of investment securities and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings.\nThe largest contributor to 2014's improved profitability was net interest income. For 2015, improvement in net interest income was just one factor of many. Lower loan provision and increased noninterest income were also major factors. 2015's bottom line was $694 thousand or 7.2% over 2014's. 2013 was bolstered by gain on sale of loans and securities which were a smaller part of 2014's and 2015's overall profitability.\nThe performance of our newest Sylvania office, which opened during the second half of 2014, exceeded our expectations and contributed profitably with its first year of operation. The Company continues to focus on expansion and our next office in Indiana is under construction with completion scheduled for end of first quarter 2016. Our location is situated within Huntertown but with a Fort Wayne address. We expect the office to be a slight drag on earnings during 2016 as a result of start-up costs, with great potential for later years.\nA deposit strategy to revamp the Bank's deposit mix was begun in the later part of 2014. The strategy included offering a new product line to checking and discontinuing some of the older products. An emphasis was on realigning our products to provide value to our depositors while building revenue or decreasing costs to the Bank. Secure checking and FM eXpress were two of the revamped or new offerings. This contributed to the almost $600 thousand improvement in customer service fees and other service charges and fees in noninterest income. The focus remains on growing core deposits and offering additional services. The success of this strategy is evidenced by the growth in core deposits along with increased debit card activity, on-line statement usage and lower cost of funds.\nShort-term rates increased slightly in December of 2015. The slope of the yield curve for most of 2015, enabled the Company to continue to sell investment securities with shorter term maturities and recognize a gain without compromising the yield. In prior years, the proceeds were mainly reinvested in the security portfolio while 2014's and 2015's proceeds were used to fund loan growth. For 2015, the recognized gain was $451 thousand, which was lower than 2014's $494 thousand and 2013's $775 thousand. The Bank was able to continue to capitalize on the steepness of the yield curve. The market value of the security portfolio has decreased as evidenced by the comprehensive income reported on the income statement. The Company will continue to look for opportunities to utilize the investment portfolio to fund loan growth.\nThroughout 2014 and 2015, the Company has done an exceptional job of recognizing opportunities to provide services and products that the low rate environment made possible. A commitment to improve asset quality over the years also benefited the Company during the period of 2012 through 2015. These opportunities are further discussed in the Material Changes in Results of Operations. The Company remains strong, stable and well capitalized and has the\ncapacity to continue to cover the increased costs of doing business in a tough economy while seeking good loans to improve profitability. The Company continues to look for new opportunities to generate and protect revenue while providing additional channels through which to serve our customers and maintain our high level of customer satisfaction.\nMaterial Changes in Results of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nThe discussion now centers on the individual line items of the consolidated statement of income and their effect on net income. This section will focus on the most traditional source of revenue contributing to the profitability of the Company, net interest income.\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets, such as interest bearing deposits and other borrowings. Net interest income is affected by changes in both interest rates and the amount and composition of earning assets and liabilities. The change in net interest income is most often measured as a result of two statistics - interest spread and net interest margin. The difference between the yields on earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities supporting those funds represents the interest spread. Because noninterest bearing sources of funds such as demand deposits and stockholders' equity also support earning assets, the net interest margin exceeds the interest spread.\nNet interest income showed an increase of $326 thousand in 2015 as compared to 2014 and an increase of $3.2 million when compared to 2013. Interest and fee income from loans were responsible for the improvement. Given that securities were sold to fund the loan growth, interest income from that balance sheet component has declined each of the last two years. Total interest income was $197 thousand higher for 2015 than 2014 and 2014 was $2.0 million higher than 2013.\nA trend of declining interest expense also positively impacted net interest income in terms of dollars. Two strategies employed during 2014 and 2015 were responsible. One was to allow expensive time deposit funds to run off and secondly to offer new non-interest bearing deposit products. The new secure checking product also caused some movement of existing funds out of interest bearing products to this new non-interest bearing account. Interest on deposits decreased $189 thousand in 2015 as compared to 2014 which followed a $735 thousand decrease for 2014 as compared to 2013. For 2015, total interest expense (which includes federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreement to repurchase, and borrowed funds) totaled $3.6 million which was down $129 thousand from 2014's $3.7 million. Total interest expense for 2014 was down $888 thousand from 2013's $4.6 million.\nThe success of 2015 and 2014 in improving net interest income confirmed that management's long term strategy of repositioning the balance sheet was the correct approach. Funding loan growth with internal funds, whether from the liquidation of investment securities or core deposits, was a beneficial move.\nOverall, we began to see an increase in the net interest margin and spread starting the fourth quarter of 2013 and the expansion continued throughout 2014 and lessened in 2015. The net interest margin decreased by 14 basis points during 2015 as compared to 2014 with the yield on interest earning assets the main factor. Loan volume was behind the improvement in interest income as the yield on the overall loan portfolio decreased 15 basis points during 2015. 2014 had already decreased by 10 basis points as compared to 2013. Decrease in loan yield was caused by a change in portfolio mix and by the lower repricing of loans. The only category of asset yield to increase was the short term federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits which was aided by the Federal Reserve increase in rates of 25 basis points in December 2015. Asset yield decreased 17 basis points in 2015 as compared to 2014 and was preceded by an increase of 39 basis points.\nCost of funds were nearing a half of one percent and ended at 0.54% for the average during 2015. This was down 1 basis point from 2014 and 2014 had been down 10 basis points from 2013. As mentioned previously, the movement of some of the interest bearing checking accounts greatly helped to decrease interest expense in terms of dollars; however, it also removed some of the lowest cost of funds out of the cost percentages. Therefore, the correlation to improvement in margin and spread is not easily visible.\nThe Company will always prefer to see improvement in real dollars over percentages. The strategy for increasing core deposits remains for 2016 for all the dollar reasons behind it to decrease interest expense and to continue to establish the opportunity for fee dollars from services provided.\nTotal assets of the Company increased overall as did the earning assets in both average and actual during 2015. This matched the movement in interest dollars, just not in yield. 2014 experienced just the opposite: a decrease in asset size and an improvement in yield. The earnings were over $2 million higher and the yield 39 basis points higher for 2014 as compared to 2013. The largest increase in balances and interest income was in the loan portfolio. One similarity between 2015 and 2014 was that loan volume was the driver to income improvement not rate. For 2015, the growth in loan volume yielded $2.2 million in interest income versus a decrease of $1.0 million due to rate. For 2014, the growth in the balances earned an amount higher at $3.7 million, than the $575 thousand given up due to lower yields on the portfolio as compared to 2013. The interest earning line item made up of investment securities had lower earnings in 2015 and 2014 than in 2013. Lower average balances, with the exception of tax-exempt investment securities, were the cause as the balances decreased to fund loan growth. The improvement in interest earnings from loan growth far outweighed the decreased earnings in the remaining earning assets for both 2015 and 2014.\nBefore switching to the interest expense discussion, a quick review of 2013's interest income will be summarized. 2014 was a reversal to the trends of previous years with its significant loan growth and higher interest earnings. During 2013 the Company experienced compression on the yield of earning assets.\nDuring 2013, earning assets increased during the year in actual and average balance. The interest collected on the earning assets decreased; with the yield decreasing as compared to 2012 in most portfolios. The largest decrease in yield occurred in the loans. 2013's loan growth occurred mainly in commercial real estate which pushed lower yields along with variable repricing continuing to price down. Investment securities had lower yields due to the large amount of calls on government sponsored agencies and the lower yield on new purchases. The portfolio decreased $3.1 million in average during 2013 as compared to 2012. It was not unusual for a called security to be replaced with a new security with a yield lower by 50 basis points or more. Overall, this portfolio's yield was 7 basis points lower in 2013 than in 2012.\nLoans, which have the highest earning asset yield, increased on average by $14.4 million from 2012 to 2013. The overall change in yield in the loan portfolio for 2013 and 2012 was due mainly to the change in rate. Given that the loan portfolio represented only 57.5% of the earning assets in 2013 as compared to 56% in 2012, it stands to reason that the overall asset yield decreased in every year since 2010 until 2014. The overall yield on earning assets decreased 24 basis points as compared to 2012. The higher ratio of loans to earning assets of 1.5% corresponded to a smaller decrease in the overall asset yield of 26 basis points between 2013 and 2012. This emphasizes how important and how significant an impact an increase in loan balances had on the Bank's profitability\nNet interest spread is the difference between what the Company earns on its assets and what it pays on its liabilities. It is generally from this spread that the Company must fund its operations and generate profit. When the asset yield decreases so must funding costs in order to maintain profitability. It becomes increasingly challenging as the asset yield gets closer to the prime lending rate, or the break-even point, of operations.\nWith respect to interest expense, a decrease in the cost is apparent for 2015 as compared to both 2014 and 2013. Fortunately, for 2014, both the interest factors of the net interest margin ratio improved to raise the margin by 48 basis points over 2013. Unfortunately, in 2015 and 2013, as compared to each preceding year, the asset yield decreased more than funding costs. As a result, both the net interest margin and spread decreased for both those periods as of 2015 and 2013.\nThe impact of the change in the portfolio mix was a factor in the liabilities as it was in the assets. Time deposits and other borrowed money term liabilities decreased in interest expense in comparing 2015 to 2014 and 2014 to 2013. Saving deposits increased in cost for 2015 as compared to 2014. Approximately two third's was due to balances increasing and the other one third due to rate. Fed Funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase increased for both 2015 and 2014. While 2014 was due to increased balance, 2015 was due to higher rates. Time deposits and other borrowed money both decreased in cost and balances during all three years presented. The Bank paid off $4.5 and $7.1 million of FHLB borrowings during 2014 and 2013 respectively. The Bank again borrowed $10 million in December 2015 to fund loan, growth. The average balance of other borrowed money was lower by $50 thousand for 2015 which calculated to $108 thousand. The average balance was $158 thousand for 2014 and a much higher $6.7 million for 2013.\nThe following tables present net interest income, interest spread and net interest margin for the three years 2013 through 2015, comparing average outstanding balances of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities with the associated interest income and expense. The tables show the corresponding average rates of interest earned and paid. The tax-exempt asset yields have been tax adjusted to reflect a marginal corporate tax rate of 34%. Average outstanding loan balances include non-performing loans and mortgage loans held for sale. Average outstanding security balances are computed based on carrying values including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities.\nThe percentage of interest earning assets to total assets increased to 92.8% in 2015 from 2014, preceded by a decrease to 89.1% in 2014 from 93.9% 2013. Noninterest earning assets increased during 2014 by $46.1 million as the earning credit rates paid by our correspondent banks were higher than the interest rates. The Bank switched those accounts to noninterest bearing to save costs which resulted in a lower percentage of interest earning assets.\nNoninterest bearing liabilities increased on average $9.7 million in 2015 over 2014, providing the lowest cost of funds possible. Movement in the Bank's deposits, specifically checking products, to the newer noninterest bearing \u201cPure\u201d and \u201cSecure\u201d checking product lines was the main driver.\nThe deposit strategy was implemented during 2014 to alter the deposit mix and introduce new products resulted in lower interest bearing liabilities. In average balances, 2014 had $41.3 million less than 2013 in interest bearing liabilities. \u201cSecure\u201d and \u201cPure\u201d checking were the main launches. Secure checking offers ID Protect along with credit score monitoring (reporting the score quarterly and providing notification of any access occurring) for a monthly charge. Pure provides depositors options to reduce or eliminate fees through modification of usage or having a total deposit relationship over a specified amount. The majority of the new offered accounts were noninterest bearing which caused the reduction in interest bearing liabilities. Time deposits also continued to run off during 2014 thereby reducing in average balance, by approximately $36.1 million as compared to 2013. The average cost of deposits also decreased 10 basis points, aided by the decrease in time deposits and payoff of all other borrowed money during 2014. The average cost of funds for 2015 was 0.54%, the average cost in 2014 for interest bearing liabilities was 0.55% compared to 0.65% in 2013.\nThe yield on Tax-Exempt investment securities shown in the following charts were computed on a tax equivalent basis. The yield on Loans has been tax adjusted for the portion of tax-exempt IDB loans included in the total. Total Interest Earning Assets is therefore also reflecting a tax equivalent yield in both line items, also with the Net Interest Spread and Margin. The adjustments were based on a 34% tax rate.\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

mentioned in the discussion earlier, in reviewing years 2014 to 2013, the change in volume is the main driver for the improved ratio which is opposite of the change between 2013 to 2012 the largest impact was due to rate. The strategy since 2010 has been to extend the maturities of time deposit \u201cspecials\u201d to over 24 months to prepare for a rising rate environment. The other strategy employed since 2011 was to increase core deposits by offering innovative products focused on customer needs, such as higher interest rates and fraud notification. In exchange for these\naccounts, customers were asked to utilize services that benefited both the Bank and themselves. Smaller time deposit rate shoppers had an option to perhaps change their behavior of banking or allow those deposits to run off. The new core deposit products were indeed embraced by our customers and have helped to attain the deposit portfolio mix sought by the Bank.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe discussion now turns to the noninterest activity of 2015 operations, beginning with the revenue portion. In comparing line items of the consolidated statements of income for years ended 2013 through 2015, it can be seen where the Company has been spending its time and the impact of the recession and slow recovery. This section will focus on the significant noninterest items that impacted the operations of the Company.\nThe Company has concerns with the increased costs associated with regulatory compliance such as the possible loss of revenue from new regulations stemming from the Dodd-Frank Act. History has proven the concern is justified. One area of revenue impacted was overdraft fees. Updated Regulation E guidelines were implemented on August 15, 2010 and the Bank has ended each year since with a lower revenue stream from overdraft fees. This has occurred in spite of the addition of the new offices since 2010. Each year, the number of checking accounts increased along with the balances; however average collected overdraft fees per account decreased. Overdraft fees in 2015 accounted for $2.4 million in noninterest income, compared to $2.5 million in 2014 and $2.7 million for 2013. The Bank had made this an area of focus for 2015 as this revenue stream remains under intense regulator review. In 2015, the Bank adjusted its overdraft program and renamed it \u201cCourtesy Pay\u201d. Courtesy Pay establishes dynamic limits based on a customer's behavior and likelihood of repayment. The Bank has sought to better service the customer's needs while decreasing the need for collections and improving profitability. At the current time, profitability has not been impacted. Service charges on checking accounts, excluding Health Savings Accounts, were up $120 thousand for 2015 and $208.7 thousand for 2014. This improvement is credited to the new checking accounts mentioned previously.\nThe Bank has long promoted the use of debit cards by its customers and continued that philosophy with the introduction of additional new products. 2015 revenue improved $142.9 thousand and 2014 revenue improved $250.5 from ATM/debit card usage as compared to 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Bank receives interchange revenue from each use by a customer of the card. In 2011, this revenue stream was at risk of being reduced by the Federal Reserve regulation of the interchange fee. The establishment by the Federal Reserve of a tiered pricing for banks under $10 billion has helped to protect the profitability from such fees, although the concern remains as to how long this tiered pricing will remain in effect. While this revenue stream continues to improve with more depositors using electronic methods for purchasing, the expense of fraud has offset a portion of the revenue gain. Further discussion can be found in the non-interest expense section regarding the net effect of debit card activity.\nNoninterest income from net gain on sales of loans decreased for both 2015 and 2014 as compared to 2013. Unfortunately, this has become a trend mainly due to the duration of the flat rate interest environment. The net gain on sale of loans is derived from sales of real estate loans into the secondary market. Of these loan types, the Bank sells 100% of the residential loans and 90% of the agricultural loans into the secondary market. 2014 or 2015 activity did not reach the same high levels as 2013. Gains of $559.6 and $140.8 thousand were recorded for residential and agricultural real estate respectively for 2015 along with gains of $452.7 and $194.3 thousand were recorded for residential and agricultural real estate respectively for 2014. In conjunction with these sales, the Bank maintains servicing rights and those income amounts during all three years are included in the customer service fees line item and account for over $300 thousand in revenue each year.\nThe last line item in the noninterest income section as was discussed previously is the net gain on sale of investments. The Bank has taken advantage of this opportunity the last three years and expects to continue as long as the rates remain low and the yield curve is favorable to the transaction. The Bank will not increase short-term gains at the sacrifice of long-term profitability. All of the sales of securities in 2015 and 2014 of $47.0 and $57.9 million respectively were used to fund loan growth while only some of the $91 million in proceeds realized on the sale of securities in 2013 were used to fund loan growth. This is a source of funds that will continue to be analyzed for use in the coming year. Gains of $451 thousand were recorded for 2015, $494 thousand for 2014 as compared to $775 thousand for 2013.\nCustomer service fees show a nice improvement of $623 thousand collected in 2015 as compared to 2014. Almost $200 thousand can be attributed to classifying foreign ATM fees out of service charges into miscellaneous fees in 2015. An additional $104.7 thousand comes from servicing those sold secondary loans mentioned in gain on sale of loans, as the volume increased in 2015 as compared to 2014. Total loan service fees collected in 2015 was $1.2 million compared to $1.1 million in 2014.\nOverall, noninterest income increased $604 thousand in 2015 following a year where it had decreased $654 thousand. Some of the revenue may not be easily duplicated as it is dependent on economic and market conditions to provide the opportunity. However, the increased revenue amounts from deposit and loan services should continue to provide improved profitability in the future. Gains on sales should also continue in the near term though when it will change is unknown at this time.\nNon-Interest Expense\nNoninterest expense increased 3.4% in 2015 as compared to 2014 and was preceded by a 4.2% increase in 2014 as compared to 2013. Represented in dollars, 2015 was $854 thousand higher than 2014 and 2014 was $1 million higher than 2013. The largest factor behind both years increase was the expense of employee salaries and wages. During 2015, an additional $721 thousand was spent over 2014 which correlates to a 7.1% increase. When making the same analysis for 2014 as compared to 2013, 2014's costs increased $633 thousand or 6.6%. Three main components flow into salaries and wages: base salary, deferred costs, and incentives composed of the expense of restricted stock awards and performance incentives. Base pay has increased with the addition of the three offices of Waterville, Custar and Sylvania, the Captive and through normal yearly increases to the remainder of the employees. Base pay was up $559.3 thousand for 2015 over the previous year and 2014 was up $474.1 thousand over 2013. The full time equivalent number of employees at each yearend increased to 265 for 2015, to 260 for 2014 compared to 2013's 251.\nIncentive pay as it related to performance was up $209.5 thousand in 2014 over 2013. Both measurements used to award incentive pay had improved in 2015 and 2014 and employees benefited accordingly. These followed 2013, a year in which the incentive performance pay was down $110.1 thousand from 2012. The expense for the restricted stock awards has also increased each of the last three years as more shares have been granted to a larger number of employees. 2015's cost for this program was $82 thousand higher than 2014 and 2014 was $20.9 thousand higher than 2013. The awards incorporate a three year vesting period so the increase of any one year carries forward through the next two years. This expense should continue to increase as the Company continues its expansion strategy. (For further discussion in incentive pay and restricted stock awards, see note 11 of the consolidated financial statements.)\nEmployee benefits increased by similar percentages as the salaries and wages for 2015 increased by 6.9% over 2014 and 2014 increased by 3.3% over 2013. The cost of the 401-K retirement plan increased each year as the profit share component increased along with the number of employees participating. The Company has been able to hold steady the expense of the employee's group insurance while paying higher premiums. Being partially self-insured has helped with lower claim experience though it is an unknown each year what that experience will be. For 2014 and 2015, a switch in the medical provider and comparison pricing also assisted to control the cost. Employees do participate in any premium increases.\nNet occupancy expense typically increases as the Company expands, with 2014 being an exception due to an increase in building rent. Building rent is netted out to offset occupancy expense. The greatest contributor to building rent comes from the division of FM Investments within the Bank. This division experienced a strong 2014; however the department was short staffed most of 2015. This has been remedied in 2016 and performance is expected to improve.\nWhile net loss on sale of other assets owned, mainly ORE property, does not represent income for the years presented, the decrease in the amount of the loss for 2015 as compared to 2014, does contribute to improved profitability. Loss on sale of assets included any write downs in the carrying values of ORE property on the Bank's balance sheet. In 2015 and 2014, the number of properties and the corresponding carrying values decreased as compared to 2013. The Bank also sold its St. Joe, Indiana property during 2015. While taking a loss for the sale, the Bank eliminated the continued maintenance expense of an unoccupied building. An easement was agreed upon to enable the ATM located on the property to remain operational.\nThe mortgage refinancing activity has been lower over the last three years. A correlating expense to that activity is the amortization of mortgage servicing rights. The amortization is the expense that offsets the income recognized when the loan is first made. Income is recorded when the mortgage loan is first sold with servicing retained and is therefore recognized within one year. The amortization, however, is calculated over the life of the loan and accelerated as loans are paid off early. An increase in this expense can be driven by two activities: an increase in the number of sold loans and/or by the acceleration of the expense from payoff and refinance activity. The best picture of the bottom line impact is achieved by netting the income with the expense each year. 2015 had net income of $33 thousand, a switch from\n2014 which had net expense of $42.7 thousand and 2013 had a net income of $2 thousand. Of course, the value (or income) of the mortgage servicing right when sold also impacts the net position. 2015 had higher additions and lower amortization expense from refinanced loans. 2013 had new loan activity and lower refinance activity making the additions and amortization almost equal. The number of loans and balances also indicates this as the levels have remained fairly constant. 2014 was a year with limited sales and the amortization expense was therefore higher than the capitalized additions. As of December 2015, 3,598 loans are being serviced with balances of $275.7 million. As of December 31, 2014, there were 3,638 loans serviced with balances of $275.4 million and as of December 2013, there were 3,684 loans serviced with balances of $282.1 million.\nThe impact of mortgage servicing rights to both noninterest income and expense is shown in the following table:\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In Thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,066 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,063 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capitalized Additions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>429 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(374 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(344 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(426 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Valuation Allowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> End of Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,056 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,066 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Furniture and equipment steadily increases as we continue to add facilities and invest in technology. Annual maintenance costs continue to grow and become a greater piece of the overall cost. As new services are provided to our customers, the backroom cost to supply them continues to rise. The Company accepts it is an expected cost of doing business and keeping our services relevant to the industry.\nData processing expense increased $50 thousand during 2015 and by $38 thousand in 2014. The Company continues to investigate ways to reduce this expense. The pricing on many services, however, is based on number of accounts and the Bank fully expects those to increase with the growth from the newer offices and overall Bank growth.\nThe last line item with significant variation in noninterest expense to discuss is \u201cother general and administrative\u201d. The decrease of $348 thousand for 2015 as compared to 2014 can be mainly attributed to a $195.7 thousand reduction in marketing and consulting costs. A renegotiation of one service provider contract along with the maturity of another during 2015 lead to the decrease. Another contributor to the reduction was lower losses due to NSF and fraud. The Bank applauds the work of our front-line staff to recognize possible fraud and scams attempted on our customers and stopping them before they can occur. An investment in additional fraud detection software has also helped our back office personnel to detect possible digital fraud. This was down $60.2 thousand in 2015 compared to an increase in 2014 of $40.9 thousand.\nOther general and administrative was higher by $461 thousand in 2014. The fluctuation was not isolated to a single source. The primary factors impacting this fluctuation in 2014 are increases in both ATM expense and core deposit intangible expenses. The increased expense of $52.7 thousand relating to ATM and debit cards in 2015 and 2014 over the previous year is caused by many factors. Increased usage during both years corresponds to increases in both revenue and cost. Finally, fraud increases cost as new cards have to be issued to limit the risk exposure. The fraud losses themselves are not recognized in this breakout, however the cost of replacement cards is. The Bank is currently deploying chip technology within its cards; the Bank is aware the adoption of embedded chips will increase this expense in the coming years. 2014 experienced additional expense over 2013 in consulting ($161.7 thousand), audit and accounting fees ($166.5 thousand) and advertising ($101.3 thousand).\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nProvision expense decreased by $566 thousand for 2015, following an increase of $333 thousand for 2014. The decrease for 2015 was due to the consistent strong asset quality of the Bank's loan portfolio as evidenced by low levels of both net charge-offs and delinquencies. The increase for 2014 was needed to account for the loan growth and the net charge-off activity of 2014. Sustained strong asset quality kept the provision expense lower than the growth alone would have warranted. Net charge-offs were $473, $480 and $888 thousand for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Commercial and Industrial loans had the largest charge-off activity in 2015 and 2013, while 2014 was impacted with higher levels in the consumer portfolios.\nThe Company segregates its Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) into two reserves: The ACL and the Allowance for Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit (AULC). When combined, these reserves constitute the total ACL. The AUCL is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Bank's ALLL methodology captures trends in leading, current, and lagging indicators which will directly affect the Bank's allocation amount. The Bank monitors trends in such leading indicators as delinquency, unemployment changes in the Bank's service area, experience and ability of staff, regulatory trends, and credit concentrations. A current indicator such as the total watch list loan amount to Capital, and a lagging indicator such as the charge off amount are referenced as well. A matrix formed by loan type from these indicators is used in making ALLL adjustments.\nWatch list loan balances are comprised of loans graded 5-8. These loan balances decreased 53.6% or $7.2 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. The balances decreased mainly due to successful results from collection efforts. Given the size of the decrease, it is no surprise it is attributed mainly to the commercial real estate portfolio decreasing by $5.9 million. Three customers made up the bulk of the balances with one of three finding funding elsewhere. Commercial loans (non-real estate) on the Bank's watch list also had a nice decrease during 2015, though just not as high at $1.9 million.\nOf the aggregate watch list loan balances, as of December 31, 2015, special mention accounted for 36.6% with substandard comprising 49.1% and doubtful accounting for the final 14.3%. In comparison to 2014, special mention was down $7.2 million, substandard up slightly by $161 thousand and doubtful down almost exactly the same amount at $162 thousand.\nSpecial mention loan balances increased 21.2% or $1.7 million overall as of yearend 2014 compared to same date 2013. The increase was in the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios. The largest increase of $2.1 million was in the commercial real estate, which was caused mainly by one large relationship being downgraded. Agricultural real estate decreased $618 thousand, thereby offsetting the above-referenced increase.\nFor 2014, the increase in special mention is offset by significant decreases in the substandard classifications of those same commercial related portfolios. Overall, substandard and doubtful loans decreased 42.5% or $2.9 million as compared to yearend 2013. In response to these fluctuations and loan growth during 2014 and 2015, the Bank changed ALLL to outstanding loan coverage percentage changed to 0.88% as of December 31, 2015, 0.95% as of December 31, 2014 from and 0.90% as of December 31, 2013.\nThe above indicators are reviewed quarterly. Some of the indicators are quantifiable and, as such, will automatically adjust the ALLL once calculated. These indicators include the ratio of past due loans to total loans, loans past due greater than 30 days, and the ration of watch list loans to capital, with the watch list made up of loans graded 5, 6 or 7 on a scale of 1 (best) to 7 (worst). Other indicators use more subjective data to the extent possible to evaluate the potential for inherent losses in the Bank's loan portfolio. For example, the economic indicator uses the unemployment statistics from the communities in our market area to help determine whether the ALLL should be adjusted. At the end of each of 2013, 2014 and 2015, a slight improvement was noted in unemployment figures.\nAll aggregate commercial and agricultural credits including real estate loans of $250,000 and over are reviewed annually by both credit committees and internal loan review to look for early signs of deterioration.\nTo establish the specific reserve allocation for real estate, a discount to the market value is established to account for liquidation expenses. The discounting percentage used for real estate mirrors the discounting of real estate as provided for in the Bank's Loan Policy. However, unique or unusual circumstances may be present which will affect the real estate value and, when appropriately identified, can adjust the discounting percentage at the discretion of management.\nThe ACL increased $153 and $755 thousand during 2015 and 2014 respectively, which was preceded by a $29 thousand decrease during 2013. The large increase in 2014 directly correlates to the large increase in loan balances. With the improved asset quality, the metrics upon which the ACL is calculated did not support a larger increase in 2015 even though loan growth occurred. The percentage of ACL to the total loan portfolio was 0.93% as of December 31, 2013, 0.98% as of December 31, 2014 and 0.91% as of December 31, 2015. December 31, 2013 had the lowest loans past due 30+ day percentage at 0.25% in the Bank's known history, December 31, 2014 and 2015 were still at respectable lows of 0.37% and 0.32%.\nPlease see Note 4 in the consolidated financial statement for additional tables regarding the composition of the ACL.\nFederal Income Taxes\nEffective tax rates were 26.97%, 28.64% and 28.53% for 2015, 2014 and 2013 respectively. The effect of tax-exempt interest from holding tax-exempt securities and Industrial Development Bonds (IDBs) was $554, $634, and $640 thousand for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. All years included an increase into a higher tax bracket for income over $10 million. Behind the decrease in 2015 is one of the benefits from the establishment of the Captive subsidiary.\nMaterial Changes in Financial Condition\nThe shifts in the balance sheet during 2015 and 2014 have positioned the Company for continued improvement in profitability. On the asset side, the Company experiences an increase in interest income due to loan growth with funding provided by a decrease in the investment portfolio, core deposit growth and 2015 also utilized other borrowings. The cost of funds was impacted by the shift of interest bearing liabilities to noninterest and the decrease in time deposits and other borrowed money as borrowings didn't increase until December 2015. Both contributed to improved profitability in 2015 and 2014 and leads to expected liabilities improvement in future years.\nAverage earning assets increased throughout 2015 and 2014. Loan growth in both years was the main factor. 2014 was also aided by the Custar acquisition which took place in December 2013 and brought in $29 million in deposits. 2015 also had the addition of the Sylvania office for a full year along with the growth in the other newer offices.\nSecurities\nThe investment portfolio is primarily used to provide overall liquidity for the Bank. It is also used to provide required collateral for pledging to the Bank's Ohio public depositors for amounts on deposit in excess of the FDIC coverage limits. It may also be used to pledge for additional borrowings from third parties. Investments are made with the above criteria in mind while still seeking a fair market rate of return, and looking for maturities that fall within the projected overall strategy of the Bank. The possible need to fund growth is also a consideration.\nAll of the Bank's security portfolio is categorized as available for sale and as such is recorded at market value.\nSecurity balances as of December 31 are summarized below:\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In Thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Treasury\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,272 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Government agencies\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98,220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119,234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172,972 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,792 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State and local governments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,066 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81,473 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>235,115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>248,492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>324,509 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The following table sets forth the maturities of investment securities as of December 31, 2015 and the weighted average yields of such securities calculated on the basis of cost and effective yields weighted for the scheduled maturity of each security.

The largest segment of holdings is in US Governments. The Bank also holds stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati at a cost of $3.7 million. This is required in order to obtain Federal Home Loan Bank loans. The Bank also owns stock of Farmer Mac with a carrying value of $37.4 thousand which is required to participate loans in the program.\nLoan Portfolio\nThe Bank's various loan portfolios are subject to varying levels of credit risk. Management mitigates these risks through portfolio diversification and through standardization of lending policies and procedures.\nRisks are mitigated through an adherence to the Bank's loan policies, with any exception being recorded and approved by senior management or committees comprised of senior management. The Bank's loan policies define parameters to essential underwriting guidelines such as loan-to-value ratio, cash flow and debt-to-income ratio, loan requirements and covenants, financial information tracking, collection practice and others. The maximum loan amount to any one borrower is limited by the Bank's legal lending limits and is stated in policy. On a broader basis, the Bank restricts total aggregate funding in comparison to Bank capital to any one business or agricultural sector by an approved sector percentage to capital limitation.\nThe

irregularly or at less than original contractual rates. Interest income that would have been recorded under the original terms of these loans would have aggregated $117.1 thousand for 2015, $52.3 thousand for 2014 and $139.1 thousand for 2013. Any collections of interest on nonaccrual loans are included in interest income when collected unless it is on an impaired loan with a specific allocation. A collection of interest on an impaired loan with a specific allocation is applied to the loan balance to decrease the allocation. Total interest collections, whether on an accrued or cash basis, amounted to $76 thousand for 2015, $87 thousand for 2014 and $60 thousand for 2013. $20.6 thousand of interest collected in 2015 was applied to reduce the specific allocation and was applied for the same reason in 2014.\nLoans are placed on nonaccrual status in the event that the loan is in past due status for more than 90 days or payment in full of principal and interest is not expected. The Bank had nonaccrual loan balances of $2.1 million at December 31, 2015 compared to balances of $3.3 and $1.7 million as of year-end 2013 and 2014, respectively. All of the balances of nonaccrual loans for the past three years were collaterally secured.\nAs of December 31, 2015 the Bank had $7.0 million of loans which it considers to be \u201cpotential problem loans\u201d in that the borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties. At December 31, 2014, the Bank had $13.5 million of these loans. These loans are subject to constant management attention and are reviewed at least monthly. The amount of the potential problem loans was considered in management's review of the loan loss reserve at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nIn extending credit to families, businesses and governments, banks accept a measure of risk against which an allowance for possible loan loss is established by way of expense charges to earnings. This expense is determined by management based on a detailed monthly review of the risk factors affecting the loan portfolio, including general economic conditions, changes in the portfolio mix, past due loan-loss experience and the financial condition of the bank's borrowers.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Bank had loans outstanding to individuals and firms engaged in the various fields of agriculture in the amount of $82.8 million with an additional $58.5 million in agricultural real estate loans these compared to $74.6 and $50.9 million respectively as of December 31, 2014. The ratio of this segment of loans to the total loan portfolio is not considered unusual for a bank engaged in and servicing rural communities.\nInterest rate modification to reflect a decrease in market interest rates or maintain a relationship with the debtor, where the debtor is not experiencing financial difficulty and can obtain funding from other sources, is not considered a troubled debt restructuring. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank had $1.1 million of its loans that were classified as troubled debt restructurings, of which $182.4 thousand are included in non-accrual loans. This compares to $797.2 thousand as of same date 2014 and the Bank had almost $911.2 thousand classified as such as of December 31, 2013.\nUpdated appraisals are required on all collateral dependent loans once they are deemed impaired. The Bank may also require an updated appraisal of a watch list loan which the Bank monitors under their loan policy. On a quarterly basis, Bank management reviews properties supporting asset dependent loans to consider market events that may indicate a change in value has occurred.\nTo determine observable market price, collateral asset values securing an impaired loan are periodically evaluated. Maximum time of re-evaluation is every 12 months for chattels and titled vehicles and every two years for real estate. In this process, third party evaluations are obtained and heavily relied upon. Until such time that updated appraisals are received, the Bank may discount the existing collateral value used.\nPerforming \u201cnon-watch list\u201d loans secured in whole or in part by real estate, do not require an updated appraisal unless the loan is rewritten and additional funds advanced. Watch List loans secured in whole or in part by real estate require updated appraisals every two years. All loans are subject to loan to values as found in the Bank's loan policies irrespective of their grade. The Bank's watch list is reviewed on a quarterly basis by management and any questions to value are addressed at that time.\nThe majority of the Bank's loans are made in the market by lenders who live and work in the market. Thus, their evaluation of the independent valuation is also valuable and serves as a double check.\nOn extremely rare occasions, the Bank will make adjustments to the recorded values of collateral securing commercial real estate loans without acquiring an updated appraisal for the subject property. The Bank has no formalized policy for determining when collateral value adjustments between regularly scheduled appraisals are necessary, nor does it use any specific methodology for applying such adjustments. However, on a quarterly basis as part of its normal operations, the Bank's senior management and the Loan Review Committee will meet to review all commercial credits either deemed to be impaired or on the Bank's watch list. In addition to analyzing the recent performance of these loans, management and the Enterprise Risk Management Committee will also consider any general market conditions that might warrant adjustments to the value of particular real estate collateralizing commercial loans. In addition, management conducts annual reviews of all commercial loans exceeding certain outstanding balance thresholds. In each of these situations, any information available to management regarding market conditions impacting a specific property or other relevant factors are considered, and lenders familiar with a particular commercial real estate loan and the underlying collateral may be present to provide their opinion on such factors. If the available information leads management to conclude a valuation adjustment is warranted, such an adjustment may be applied on the basis of the information available. If management concludes that an adjustment is warranted but lacks the specific information needed to reasonably quantify the adjustment, management will order a new appraisal on the subject property even though one may not be required under the Bank's general policies for updating appraisal.\nNote 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements may also be reviewed for additional tables dealing with the Bank's loans and ALLL.\nALLL is evaluated based on an assessment of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio. This assessment results in an allowance consisting of two components, allocated and unallocated.\nManagement considers several different risk assessments in determining ALLL. The allocated component of ALLL reflects expected losses resulting from an analysis of individual loans, developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and historical loss experience for each loan category. For those loans where the internal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification and management can reasonably estimate the loss that will be sustained based upon collateral, the borrowers operating activity and economic conditions in which the borrower operates, a specific allocation is made. For those borrowers that are not currently behind in their payment, but for which management believes, based on economic conditions and operating activities of the borrower, the possibility exists for future collection problems, a reserve is established. The amount of reserve allocated to each loan portfolio is based on past loss experiences and the different levels of risk within each loan portfolio. The historical loan loss portion is determined using a historical loss analysis by loan category.\nThe unallocated portion of the reserve for loan losses is determined based on management's assessment of general economic conditions as well as specific economic factors in the Bank's marketing area. This assessment inherently involves a higher degree of uncertainty. It represents estimated inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio that are probable due to uncertainties in economic conditions, delays in obtaining information, including unfavorable information about a borrower's financial condition and other current risk factors that may not have yet manifested themselves in the Bank's historical loss factors used to determine the allocated component of the allowance.\nActual charge-off of loan balances is based upon periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio by management. These evaluations consider several factors, including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, financial condition of the borrower, and collateral.\nAs presented below, charge-offs increased to $1.0 million for 2015, preceded by a decrease to $778 thousand for 2014, an increase to $1.3 million for 2013, decreased to $891 thousand for 2012 and 2011 recorded $2.7 million. The provision expense also decreased in 2012 and 2011 and increased for 2013 and 2014. 2015 had the lowest provision expense of all years presented at $625 thousand. 2014 and 2013 had provision expense of $1.2 million and $858 thousand respectively. 2012 had provision expense of $738 thousand with 2011 having provision expense of $1.7 million. The Commercial and Industrial portfolio had the largest net charge-off position in 2011 through 2015. The improvement in asset quality during the periods shown is reflected in the increased percentage of the allowance for loan loss to nonperforming loans.\nIn reviewing the bigger picture of the allowance for credit loss, the years with the higher percentage of ACL to total nonperforming loans ratio account for the lower level of nonaccrual and watch list loans. This demonstrates the extended time period with which it has taken to achieve resolution and/or collection of these loans. In 2012, the provision expense was to offset the higher year-end watch list values. A smaller portion of the allowance was needed to fund the impaired loans as collateral remained sufficient to cover the outstanding amounts in most cases. 2014's significant and continued loan growth since fourth quarter 2013 was the reason behind 2014's higher balances as asset quality remained strong. The ratio of ACL to nonperforming loans increased significantly in 2014 which is why provision loan expense was lower in 2015 in comparison. The ACL to nonperforming loans for 2015 remained more than adequate and emphasizes the existing strong level of credit quality.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the allowance for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011:\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The Bank has access to $58 million of unsecured borrowings through correspondent banks and $29.4 million of unpledged securities which may be sold or used as collateral. An additional $4.1 million is also available from the Federal Home Loan Bank based on current collateral pledging with up to $118.5 million available provided adequate collateral is pledged.\nMaintaining sufficient funds to meet depositor and borrower needs on a daily basis continues to be among management's top priorities. This is accomplished not only by immediate liquid resources of cash, due from banks and federal funds sold, but also by the Bank's available for sale securities portfolio. The average aggregate balance of these assets was $262.1 for 2015 and $296.5 million for 2014, and $387.7 million for 2013. This represented 28.0%, 31.8% and 42.5% of total average assets, respectively. Of the almost $218.7 million of debt securities in the bank's portfolio as of December 31, 2015, $12.7 million, or 5.8% of the portfolio, is expected to receive payments or mature in 2016. The availability of the funds may be reduced by the need to utilize securities for pledging purposes on public deposits. This liquidity provides the opportunity to fund loan growth by analysis of the lowest cost and source of funds whether by increasing deposits, sales or runoff of investments or utilizing debt.\nIn addition to the Bank's investment portfolio, the Company has $16.4 million held in the holding company's investment portfolio. $1.5 million of those investments will mature or receive payments in the next twelve months. These funds provide liquidity to the Company. The Bank has been declaring additional dividends each quarter to provide this liquidity to the Company. In future years, the Captive will also upstream dividends to the Company once reserve levels are adequately provided for. This will also provide additional liquidity for Company activities.\nHistorically, the primary source of liquidity has been core deposits that include noninterest bearing and interest bearing demand deposits, savings, money market accounts and time deposits of individuals. Core deposit balances as of year-end 2015 increased in all categories with the exception of time deposits. Overall deposits increased an average of $2.6 million in 2015, $913 thousand in 2014 and $4.7 million during 2013. The Bank also utilized Federal Funds purchased at times during 2013 through 2015. The average balance for 2015 and 2014 was $1.2 million and $1.4 million respectively. The Bank began using this temporary funding source heavier in December 2015 while it secured more permanent funding.\nHistorically, the primary use of new funds is placing the funds back into the community through loans for the acquisition of new homes, consumer products and for business development. The use of new funds for loans is measured by the loan to deposit ratio. The Bank's average loan to deposit ratio was 80.7% for 2015, 76.4% for 2014 and 66.2% for 2013. The lower ratio in 2013 was due to the success of the deposit gathering function, the residential mortgage loans being sold in the secondary market and the lack of loan demand. The Bank's goal is for this ratio to be higher in the 80-90 percent range with loan growth being the driver. The Bank ended the year 2015 at an 88.1% loan to deposit ratio.\nShort-term debt such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase also provides the Company with liquidity. Short-term debt for both federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase amounted to $78.8 million at the end of 2015 compared to $56.0 million at the end of 2014 and $69.8 million at the end of 2013. These accounts are used to provide a sweep product to the Bank's commercial customers.\n\u201cOther borrowings\u201d are also a source of funds. Other borrowings consist of loans from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati. These funds are then used to provide loans in our community. The Bank utilized this funding source in December 2015 by borrowing $10 million. Prior borrowings from this source had decreased by $4.5 million to none at December 31, 2014. This compares to decreased borrowings during 2013 of $7.1 million. The decreased borrowings were payoffs of matured notes in 2013 and 2014.\nAsset/Liability Management\nThe primary functions of asset/liability management are to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. It involves the management of the balance sheet mix, maturities, re-pricing characteristics and pricing components to provide an adequate and stable net interest margin with an acceptable level of risk. Interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates.\nChanges in net income, other than those related to volume arise when interest rates on assets re-price in a time frame or interest rate environment that is different from that of the re-pricing period for liabilities. Changes in net interest income also arise from changes in the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nHistorically, the Bank has maintained liquidity through cash flows generated in the normal course of business, loan repayments, maturing earning assets, the acquisition of new deposits, and borrowings. The Bank's asset and liability management program is designed to maximize net interest income over the long term while taking into consideration both credit and interest rate risk. Interest rate sensitivity varies with different types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Overnight federal funds on which rates change daily and loans that are tied to the market rate differ considerably from long-term investment securities and fixed rate loans. Similarly, time deposits over $100,000 and money market certificates are much more interest rate sensitive than passbook savings accounts. The Bank utilizes shock analysis to examine the amount of exposure an instant rate change of 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points in both increasing and decreasing directions would have on the financials. Acceptable ranges of earnings and equity at risk are established and decisions are made to maintain those levels based on the shock results.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the Company's operations. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all the assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Company's performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and service.\nContractual Obligations\nContractual Obligations of the Company totaled $252.1 million as of December 31, 2015. Time deposits represent contractual agreements for certificates of deposits held by its customers. Long term debt represents the borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank and is further defined in Note 4 and 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Due by Period (In Thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities sold under agreement to repurchase\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89,862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>844 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividends Payable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long Term Debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>252,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>844 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Capital Resources\nStockholders' equity was $120.1 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to $114.5 million at December 31, 2014. Dividends declared during 2015 were $0.87 per share totaling $3.99 million and during 2014 were $0.84 per share totaling $3.86 million. During 2015, the Company purchased 30,685 shares and awarded 16,000 shares of restricted stock to 67 employees. During 2014, the Company purchased 23,570 shares and awarded 13,250 restricted shared to 61 employees. For a summary of activity as it relates to the Company's restricted stock awards, please refer to Note 11: Employee Benefit Plans in the consolidated financial statements. At yearend 2015, the Company held 587,466 shares in Treasury stock and 38,995 unvested shares of restricted stock. At yearend 2014, the Company held 572,662 shares in Treasury stock and 33,390 unvested shares of restricted stock. On January 15, 2016 the Company announced the authorization by its Board of Directors for the Company's repurchase, either on the open market, or in privately negotiated transactions, of up to 200,000 shares of its outstanding common stock commencing January 15, 2016 and ending December 31, 2016. The Company has a history of approving a similar resolution to be in effect each year for at least the last five years.\nThe Company continues to have a strong capital base and maintains regulatory capital ratios that are above the defined regulatory capital ratios. At December 31, 2015, the Bank and the Company had total risk-based capital ratios of 12.64% and 14.95%, respectively. Core capital to risk-based asset ratios of 11.87% and 14.18% for the Bank and the Company, respectively, are well in excess of regulatory guidelines. The Bank's leverage ratio of 10.12% is also substantially in excess of regulatory guidelines, as is the Company's at 11.91%. Under Basel III, the common equity Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets ratios are also well above the required 4.50% and the 6.50% well capitalized levels with the Company at 14.18% and the Bank at 11.87%. For further discussion and analysis of regulatory capital requirements, refer to Note 15 of the Audited Financial Statements.\nThe Company's subsidiaries are restricted by regulations from making dividend distributions in excess of certain prescribed amounts. Upon prior regulatory approval, the Bank may be allowed to pay above the prescribed amount.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and the Company follows general practices within the financial services industry in which it operates. At times the application of these principles requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These assumptions, estimates and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. As this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different assumptions, estimates and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on assumptions, estimates and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Examples of critical assumptions, estimates and judgments are when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not required to be recorded at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability must be recorded contingent upon a future event.\nAll significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued and how those values are determined for the financial statements. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to assumptions, estimates and judgments underlying those amounts, management has identified the determination of the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) and the valuation of its Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) and Other Real Estate Owned (ORE) as the accounting areas that requires the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be the most subject to revision as new information becomes available.\nAssets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nThe ALLL represents management's estimate of credit losses inherent in the Bank's loan portfolio at the report date. The estimate is a composite of a variety of factors including experience, collateral value, and the general economy. ALLL includes a specific portion, a formula driven portion, and a general nonspecific portion. The collection and ultimate recovery of the book value of the collateral, in most cases, is beyond our control.\nThe Company is also required to estimate the value of its MSR. The Company recognizes as separate assets rights to service fixed rate single-family mortgage loans that it has sold without recourse but services for others for a fee. Mortgage servicing assets are initially recorded at cost, based upon pricing multiples as determined by the purchaser, when the loans are sold. Mortgage servicing assets are carried at the lower of the initial carrying value, adjusted for amortization, or estimated fair value. Amortization is determined in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income using the level yield method. For purposes of determining impairment, the mortgage servicing assets are stratified into like groups based on loan type, term, new versus seasoned and interest rate. The valuation is completed by an independent third party.\nThe expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are the most significant factors driving the potential for the impairment of the value of mortgage servicing assets. Increases in mortgage loan prepayments reduce estimated future net servicing cash flows because the life of the underlying loan is reduced.\nThe Company's mortgage servicing rights relating to loans serviced for others represent an asset of the Company. This asset is initially capitalized and included in other assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The mortgage servicing rights are then amortized against noninterest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying mortgage servicing rights. There are a number of factors, however, that can affect the ultimate value of the mortgage servicing rights to the Company, including the estimated prepayment speed of the loan and the discount rate used to present value the servicing right. For example, if the mortgage loan is prepaid, the Company will receive fewer servicing fees, meaning that the present value of the mortgage servicing rights is less than the carrying value of those rights on the Company's balance sheet. Therefore, in an attempt to reflect an accurate expected value to the Company of the mortgage servicing rights, the Company\nreceives a valuation of its mortgage servicing rights from an independent third party. The independent third party's valuation of the mortgage servicing rights is based on relevant characteristics of the Company's loan servicing portfolio, such as loan terms, interest rates and recent national prepayment experience, as well as current national market interest rate levels, market forecasts and other economic conditions. Management, with the advice from its third party valuation firm, review the assumptions related to prepayment speeds, discount rates, and capitalized mortgage servicing income on a quarterly basis. Changes are reflected in the following quarter's analysis related to the mortgage servicing asset. In addition, based upon the independent third party's valuation of the Company's mortgage servicing rights, management then establishes a valuation allowance by each strata, if necessary, to quantify the likely impairment of the value of the mortgage servicing rights to the Company. The estimates of prepayment speeds and discount rates are inherently uncertain, and different estimates could have a material impact on the Company's net income and results of operations. The valuation allowance is evaluated and adjusted quarterly by management to reflect changes in the fair value of the underlying mortgage servicing rights based on market conditions. The accuracy of these estimates and assumptions by management and its third party can be directly tied back to the fact that management has not been required to record a valuation allowance through its income statement based upon the valuation of each stratum of serving rights.\nFor more information regarding the estimates and calculations used to establish the ALLL and the value of Mortgage Servicing Rights, please see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements provided herewith.\n2015 in Review\nThe Company experienced record earnings for 2015, with net income over a milestone of $10 million. Profitability improved due to the increased loan balances, new product offerings and continued strong asset quality. Net loans grew by $63.8 million with asset size increasing by a smaller $47.9 million. Loans were funded by higher deposit levels, sales and maturities of investment securities and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings.\nThe largest contributor to 2014's improved profitability was net interest income. For 2015, improvement in net interest income was just one factor of many. Lower loan provision and increased noninterest income were also major factors. 2015's bottom line was $694 thousand or 7.2% over 2014's. 2013 was bolstered by gain on sale of loans and securities which were a smaller part of 2014's and 2015's overall profitability.\nThe performance of our newest Sylvania office, which opened during the second half of 2014, exceeded our expectations and contributed profitably with its first year of operation. The Company continues to focus on expansion and our next office in Indiana is under construction with completion scheduled for end of first quarter 2016. Our location is situated within Huntertown but with a Fort Wayne address. We expect the office to be a slight drag on earnings during 2016 as a result of start-up costs, with great potential for later years.\nA deposit strategy to revamp the Bank's deposit mix was begun in the later part of 2014. The strategy included offering a new product line to checking and discontinuing some of the older products. An emphasis was on realigning our products to provide value to our depositors while building revenue or decreasing costs to the Bank. Secure checking and FM eXpress were two of the revamped or new offerings. This contributed to the almost $600 thousand improvement in customer service fees and other service charges and fees in noninterest income. The focus remains on growing core deposits and offering additional services. The success of this strategy is evidenced by the growth in core deposits along with increased debit card activity, on-line statement usage and lower cost of funds.\nShort-term rates increased slightly in December of 2015. The slope of the yield curve for most of 2015, enabled the Company to continue to sell investment securities with shorter term maturities and recognize a gain without compromising the yield. In prior years, the proceeds were mainly reinvested in the security portfolio while 2014's and 2015's proceeds were used to fund loan growth. For 2015, the recognized gain was $451 thousand, which was lower than 2014's $494 thousand and 2013's $775 thousand. The Bank was able to continue to capitalize on the steepness of the yield curve. The market value of the security portfolio has decreased as evidenced by the comprehensive income reported on the income statement. The Company will continue to look for opportunities to utilize the investment portfolio to fund loan growth.\nThroughout 2014 and 2015, the Company has done an exceptional job of recognizing opportunities to provide services and products that the low rate environment made possible. A commitment to improve asset quality over the years also benefited the Company during the period of 2012 through 2015. These opportunities are further discussed in the Material Changes in Results of Operations. The Company remains strong, stable and well capitalized and has the\ncapacity to continue to cover the increased costs of doing business in a tough economy while seeking good loans to improve profitability. The Company continues to look for new opportunities to generate and protect revenue while providing additional channels through which to serve our customers and maintain our high level of customer satisfaction.\nMaterial Changes in Results of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nThe discussion now centers on the individual line items of the consolidated statement of income and their effect on net income. This section will focus on the most traditional source of revenue contributing to the profitability of the Company, net interest income.\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets, such as interest bearing deposits and other borrowings. Net interest income is affected by changes in both interest rates and the amount and composition of earning assets and liabilities. The change in net interest income is most often measured as a result of two statistics - interest spread and net interest margin. The difference between the yields on earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities supporting those funds represents the interest spread. Because noninterest bearing sources of funds such as demand deposits and stockholders' equity also support earning assets, the net interest margin exceeds the interest spread.\nNet interest income showed an increase of $326 thousand in 2015 as compared to 2014 and an increase of $3.2 million when compared to 2013. Interest and fee income from loans were responsible for the improvement. Given that securities were sold to fund the loan growth, interest income from that balance sheet component has declined each of the last two years. Total interest income was $197 thousand higher for 2015 than 2014 and 2014 was $2.0 million higher than 2013.\nA trend of declining interest expense also positively impacted net interest income in terms of dollars. Two strategies employed during 2014 and 2015 were responsible. One was to allow expensive time deposit funds to run off and secondly to offer new non-interest bearing deposit products. The new secure checking product also caused some movement of existing funds out of interest bearing products to this new non-interest bearing account. Interest on deposits decreased $189 thousand in 2015 as compared to 2014 which followed a $735 thousand decrease for 2014 as compared to 2013. For 2015, total interest expense (which includes federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreement to repurchase, and borrowed funds) totaled $3.6 million which was down $129 thousand from 2014's $3.7 million. Total interest expense for 2014 was down $888 thousand from 2013's $4.6 million.\nThe success of 2015 and 2014 in improving net interest income confirmed that management's long term strategy of repositioning the balance sheet was the correct approach. Funding loan growth with internal funds, whether from the liquidation of investment securities or core deposits, was a beneficial move.\nOverall, we began to see an increase in the net interest margin and spread starting the fourth quarter of 2013 and the expansion continued throughout 2014 and lessened in 2015. The net interest margin decreased by 14 basis points during 2015 as compared to 2014 with the yield on interest earning assets the main factor. Loan volume was behind the improvement in interest income as the yield on the overall loan portfolio decreased 15 basis points during 2015. 2014 had already decreased by 10 basis points as compared to 2013. Decrease in loan yield was caused by a change in portfolio mix and by the lower repricing of loans. The only category of asset yield to increase was the short term federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits which was aided by the Federal Reserve increase in rates of 25 basis points in December 2015. Asset yield decreased 17 basis points in 2015 as compared to 2014 and was preceded by an increase of 39 basis points.\nCost of funds were nearing a half of one percent and ended at 0.54% for the average during 2015. This was down 1 basis point from 2014 and 2014 had been down 10 basis points from 2013. As mentioned previously, the movement of some of the interest bearing checking accounts greatly helped to decrease interest expense in terms of dollars; however, it also removed some of the lowest cost of funds out of the cost percentages. Therefore, the correlation to improvement in margin and spread is not easily visible.\nThe Company will always prefer to see improvement in real dollars over percentages. The strategy for increasing core deposits remains for 2016 for all the dollar reasons behind it to decrease interest expense and to continue to establish the opportunity for fee dollars from services provided.\nTotal assets of the Company increased overall as did the earning assets in both average and actual during 2015. This matched the movement in interest dollars, just not in yield. 2014 experienced just the opposite: a decrease in asset size and an improvement in yield. The earnings were over $2 million higher and the yield 39 basis points higher for 2014 as compared to 2013. The largest increase in balances and interest income was in the loan portfolio. One similarity between 2015 and 2014 was that loan volume was the driver to income improvement not rate. For 2015, the growth in loan volume yielded $2.2 million in interest income versus a decrease of $1.0 million due to rate. For 2014, the growth in the balances earned an amount higher at $3.7 million, than the $575 thousand given up due to lower yields on the portfolio as compared to 2013. The interest earning line item made up of investment securities had lower earnings in 2015 and 2014 than in 2013. Lower average balances, with the exception of tax-exempt investment securities, were the cause as the balances decreased to fund loan growth. The improvement in interest earnings from loan growth far outweighed the decreased earnings in the remaining earning assets for both 2015 and 2014.\nBefore switching to the interest expense discussion, a quick review of 2013's interest income will be summarized. 2014 was a reversal to the trends of previous years with its significant loan growth and higher interest earnings. During 2013 the Company experienced compression on the yield of earning assets.\nDuring 2013, earning assets increased during the year in actual and average balance. The interest collected on the earning assets decreased; with the yield decreasing as compared to 2012 in most portfolios. The largest decrease in yield occurred in the loans. 2013's loan growth occurred mainly in commercial real estate which pushed lower yields along with variable repricing continuing to price down. Investment securities had lower yields due to the large amount of calls on government sponsored agencies and the lower yield on new purchases. The portfolio decreased $3.1 million in average during 2013 as compared to 2012. It was not unusual for a called security to be replaced with a new security with a yield lower by 50 basis points or more. Overall, this portfolio's yield was 7 basis points lower in 2013 than in 2012.\nLoans, which have the highest earning asset yield, increased on average by $14.4 million from 2012 to 2013. The overall change in yield in the loan portfolio for 2013 and 2012 was due mainly to the change in rate. Given that the loan portfolio represented only 57.5% of the earning assets in 2013 as compared to 56% in 2012, it stands to reason that the overall asset yield decreased in every year since 2010 until 2014. The overall yield on earning assets decreased 24 basis points as compared to 2012. The higher ratio of loans to earning assets of 1.5% corresponded to a smaller decrease in the overall asset yield of 26 basis points between 2013 and 2012. This emphasizes how important and how significant an impact an increase in loan balances had on the Bank's profitability\nNet interest spread is the difference between what the Company earns on its assets and what it pays on its liabilities. It is generally from this spread that the Company must fund its operations and generate profit. When the asset yield decreases so must funding costs in order to maintain profitability. It becomes increasingly challenging as the asset yield gets closer to the prime lending rate, or the break-even point, of operations.\nWith respect to interest expense, a decrease in the cost is apparent for 2015 as compared to both 2014 and 2013. Fortunately, for 2014, both the interest factors of the net interest margin ratio improved to raise the margin by 48 basis points over 2013. Unfortunately, in 2015 and 2013, as compared to each preceding year, the asset yield decreased more than funding costs. As a result, both the net interest margin and spread decreased for both those periods as of 2015 and 2013.\nThe impact of the change in the portfolio mix was a factor in the liabilities as it was in the assets. Time deposits and other borrowed money term liabilities decreased in interest expense in comparing 2015 to 2014 and 2014 to 2013. Saving deposits increased in cost for 2015 as compared to 2014. Approximately two third's was due to balances increasing and the other one third due to rate. Fed Funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase increased for both 2015 and 2014. While 2014 was due to increased balance, 2015 was due to higher rates. Time deposits and other borrowed money both decreased in cost and balances during all three years presented. The Bank paid off $4.5 and $7.1 million of FHLB borrowings during 2014 and 2013 respectively. The Bank again borrowed $10 million in December 2015 to fund loan, growth. The average balance of other borrowed money was lower by $50 thousand for 2015 which calculated to $108 thousand. The average balance was $158 thousand for 2014 and a much higher $6.7 million for 2013.\nThe following tables present net interest income, interest spread and net interest margin for the three years 2013 through 2015, comparing average outstanding balances of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities with the associated interest income and expense. The tables show the corresponding average rates of interest earned and paid. The tax-exempt asset yields have been tax adjusted to reflect a marginal corporate tax rate of 34%. Average outstanding loan balances include non-performing loans and mortgage loans held for sale. Average outstanding security balances are computed based on carrying values including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities.\nThe percentage of interest earning assets to total assets increased to 92.8% in 2015 from 2014, preceded by a decrease to 89.1% in 2014 from 93.9% 2013. Noninterest earning assets increased during 2014 by $46.1 million as the earning credit rates paid by our correspondent banks were higher than the interest rates. The Bank switched those accounts to noninterest bearing to save costs which resulted in a lower percentage of interest earning assets.\nNoninterest bearing liabilities increased on average $9.7 million in 2015 over 2014, providing the lowest cost of funds possible. Movement in the Bank's deposits, specifically checking products, to the newer noninterest bearing \u201cPure\u201d and \u201cSecure\u201d checking product lines was the main driver.\nThe deposit strategy was implemented during 2014 to alter the deposit mix and introduce new products resulted in lower interest bearing liabilities. In average balances, 2014 had $41.3 million less than 2013 in interest bearing liabilities. \u201cSecure\u201d and \u201cPure\u201d checking were the main launches. Secure checking offers ID Protect along with credit score monitoring (reporting the score quarterly and providing notification of any access occurring) for a monthly charge. Pure provides depositors options to reduce or eliminate fees through modification of usage or having a total deposit relationship over a specified amount. The majority of the new offered accounts were noninterest bearing which caused the reduction in interest bearing liabilities. Time deposits also continued to run off during 2014 thereby reducing in average balance, by approximately $36.1 million as compared to 2013. The average cost of deposits also decreased 10 basis points, aided by the decrease in time deposits and payoff of all other borrowed money during 2014. The average cost of funds for 2015 was 0.54%, the average cost in 2014 for interest bearing liabilities was 0.55% compared to 0.65% in 2013.\nThe yield on Tax-Exempt investment securities shown in the following charts were computed on a tax equivalent basis. The yield on Loans has been tax adjusted for the portion of tax-exempt IDB loans included in the total. Total Interest Earning Assets is therefore also reflecting a tax equivalent yield in both line items, also with the Net Interest Spread and Margin. The adjustments were based on a 34% tax rate.\n\n\n\nThe following tables show changes in interest income, interest expense and net interest resulting from changes in volume and rate variances for major categories of earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities.\n As mentioned in the discussion earlier, in reviewing years 2014 to 2013, the change in volume is the main driver for the improved ratio which is opposite of the change between 2013 to 2012 the largest impact was due to rate. The strategy since 2010 has been to extend the maturities of time deposit \u201cspecials\u201d to over 24 months to prepare for a rising rate environment. The other strategy employed since 2011 was to increase core deposits by offering innovative products focused on customer needs, such as higher interest rates and fraud notification. In exchange for these\naccounts, customers were asked to utilize services that benefited both the Bank and themselves. Smaller time deposit rate shoppers had an option to perhaps change their behavior of banking or allow those deposits to run off. The new core deposit products were indeed embraced by our customers and have helped to attain the deposit portfolio mix sought by the Bank.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe discussion now turns to the noninterest activity of 2015 operations, beginning with the revenue portion. In comparing line items of the consolidated statements of income for years ended 2013 through 2015, it can be seen where the Company has been spending its time and the impact of the recession and slow recovery. This section will focus on the significant noninterest items that impacted the operations of the Company.\nThe Company has concerns with the increased costs associated with regulatory compliance such as the possible loss of revenue from new regulations stemming from the Dodd-Frank Act. History has proven the concern is justified. One area of revenue impacted was overdraft fees. Updated Regulation E guidelines were implemented on August 15, 2010 and the Bank has ended each year since with a lower revenue stream from overdraft fees. This has occurred in spite of the addition of the new offices since 2010. Each year, the number of checking accounts increased along with the balances; however average collected overdraft fees per account decreased. Overdraft fees in 2015 accounted for $2.4 million in noninterest income, compared to $2.5 million in 2014 and $2.7 million for 2013. The Bank had made this an area of focus for 2015 as this revenue stream remains under intense regulator review. In 2015, the Bank adjusted its overdraft program and renamed it \u201cCourtesy Pay\u201d. Courtesy Pay establishes dynamic limits based on a customer's behavior and likelihood of repayment. The Bank has sought to better service the customer's needs while decreasing the need for collections and improving profitability. At the current time, profitability has not been impacted. Service charges on checking accounts, excluding Health Savings Accounts, were up $120 thousand for 2015 and $208.7 thousand for 2014. This improvement is credited to the new checking accounts mentioned previously.\nThe Bank has long promoted the use of debit cards by its customers and continued that philosophy with the introduction of additional new products. 2015 revenue improved $142.9 thousand and 2014 revenue improved $250.5 from ATM/debit card usage as compared to 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Bank receives interchange revenue from each use by a customer of the card. In 2011, this revenue stream was at risk of being reduced by the Federal Reserve regulation of the interchange fee. The establishment by the Federal Reserve of a tiered pricing for banks under $10 billion has helped to protect the profitability from such fees, although the concern remains as to how long this tiered pricing will remain in effect. While this revenue stream continues to improve with more depositors using electronic methods for purchasing, the expense of fraud has offset a portion of the revenue gain. Further discussion can be found in the non-interest expense section regarding the net effect of debit card activity.\nNoninterest income from net gain on sales of loans decreased for both 2015 and 2014 as compared to 2013. Unfortunately, this has become a trend mainly due to the duration of the flat rate interest environment. The net gain on sale of loans is derived from sales of real estate loans into the secondary market. Of these loan types, the Bank sells 100% of the residential loans and 90% of the agricultural loans into the secondary market. 2014 or 2015 activity did not reach the same high levels as 2013. Gains of $559.6 and $140.8 thousand were recorded for residential and agricultural real estate respectively for 2015 along with gains of $452.7 and $194.3 thousand were recorded for residential and agricultural real estate respectively for 2014. In conjunction with these sales, the Bank maintains servicing rights and those income amounts during all three years are included in the customer service fees line item and account for over $300 thousand in revenue each year.\nThe last line item in the noninterest income section as was discussed previously is the net gain on sale of investments. The Bank has taken advantage of this opportunity the last three years and expects to continue as long as the rates remain low and the yield curve is favorable to the transaction. The Bank will not increase short-term gains at the sacrifice of long-term profitability. All of the sales of securities in 2015 and 2014 of $47.0 and $57.9 million respectively were used to fund loan growth while only some of the $91 million in proceeds realized on the sale of securities in 2013 were used to fund loan growth. This is a source of funds that will continue to be analyzed for use in the coming year. Gains of $451 thousand were recorded for 2015, $494 thousand for 2014 as compared to $775 thousand for 2013.\nCustomer service fees show a nice improvement of $623 thousand collected in 2015 as compared to 2014. Almost $200 thousand can be attributed to classifying foreign ATM fees out of service charges into miscellaneous fees in 2015. An additional $104.7 thousand comes from servicing those sold secondary loans mentioned in gain on sale of loans, as the volume increased in 2015 as compared to 2014. Total loan service fees collected in 2015 was $1.2 million compared to $1.1 million in 2014.\nOverall, noninterest income increased $604 thousand in 2015 following a year where it had decreased $654 thousand. Some of the revenue may not be easily duplicated as it is dependent on economic and market conditions to provide the opportunity. However, the increased revenue amounts from deposit and loan services should continue to provide improved profitability in the future. Gains on sales should also continue in the near term though when it will change is unknown at this time.\nNon-Interest Expense\nNoninterest expense increased 3.4% in 2015 as compared to 2014 and was preceded by a 4.2% increase in 2014 as compared to 2013. Represented in dollars, 2015 was $854 thousand higher than 2014 and 2014 was $1 million higher than 2013. The largest factor behind both years increase was the expense of employee salaries and wages. During 2015, an additional $721 thousand was spent over 2014 which correlates to a 7.1% increase. When making the same analysis for 2014 as compared to 2013, 2014's costs increased $633 thousand or 6.6%. Three main components flow into salaries and wages: base salary, deferred costs, and incentives composed of the expense of restricted stock awards and performance incentives. Base pay has increased with the addition of the three offices of Waterville, Custar and Sylvania, the Captive and through normal yearly increases to the remainder of the employees. Base pay was up $559.3 thousand for 2015 over the previous year and 2014 was up $474.1 thousand over 2013. The full time equivalent number of employees at each yearend increased to 265 for 2015, to 260 for 2014 compared to 2013's 251.\nIncentive pay as it related to performance was up $209.5 thousand in 2014 over 2013. Both measurements used to award incentive pay had improved in 2015 and 2014 and employees benefited accordingly. These followed 2013, a year in which the incentive performance pay was down $110.1 thousand from 2012. The expense for the restricted stock awards has also increased each of the last three years as more shares have been granted to a larger number of employees. 2015's cost for this program was $82 thousand higher than 2014 and 2014 was $20.9 thousand higher than 2013. The awards incorporate a three year vesting period so the increase of any one year carries forward through the next two years. This expense should continue to increase as the Company continues its expansion strategy. (For further discussion in incentive pay and restricted stock awards, see note 11 of the consolidated financial statements.)\nEmployee benefits increased by similar percentages as the salaries and wages for 2015 increased by 6.9% over 2014 and 2014 increased by 3.3% over 2013. The cost of the 401-K retirement plan increased each year as the profit share component increased along with the number of employees participating. The Company has been able to hold steady the expense of the employee's group insurance while paying higher premiums. Being partially self-insured has helped with lower claim experience though it is an unknown each year what that experience will be. For 2014 and 2015, a switch in the medical provider and comparison pricing also assisted to control the cost. Employees do participate in any premium increases.\nNet occupancy expense typically increases as the Company expands, with 2014 being an exception due to an increase in building rent. Building rent is netted out to offset occupancy expense. The greatest contributor to building rent comes from the division of FM Investments within the Bank. This division experienced a strong 2014; however the department was short staffed most of 2015. This has been remedied in 2016 and performance is expected to improve.\nWhile net loss on sale of other assets owned, mainly ORE property, does not represent income for the years presented, the decrease in the amount of the loss for 2015 as compared to 2014, does contribute to improved profitability. Loss on sale of assets included any write downs in the carrying values of ORE property on the Bank's balance sheet. In 2015 and 2014, the number of properties and the corresponding carrying values decreased as compared to 2013. The Bank also sold its St. Joe, Indiana property during 2015. While taking a loss for the sale, the Bank eliminated the continued maintenance expense of an unoccupied building. An easement was agreed upon to enable the ATM located on the property to remain operational.\nThe mortgage refinancing activity has been lower over the last three years. A correlating expense to that activity is the amortization of mortgage servicing rights. The amortization is the expense that offsets the income recognized when the loan is first made. Income is recorded when the mortgage loan is first sold with servicing retained and is therefore recognized within one year. The amortization, however, is calculated over the life of the loan and accelerated as loans are paid off early. An increase in this expense can be driven by two activities: an increase in the number of sold loans and/or by the acceleration of the expense from payoff and refinance activity. The best picture of the bottom line impact is achieved by netting the income with the expense each year. 2015 had net income of $33 thousand, a switch from\n2014 which had net expense of $42.7 thousand and 2013 had a net income of $2 thousand. Of course, the value (or income) of the mortgage servicing right when sold also impacts the net position. 2015 had higher additions and lower amortization expense from refinanced loans. 2013 had new loan activity and lower refinance activity making the additions and amortization almost equal. The number of loans and balances also indicates this as the levels have remained fairly constant. 2014 was a year with limited sales and the amortization expense was therefore higher than the capitalized additions. As of December 2015, 3,598 loans are being serviced with balances of $275.7 million. As of December 31, 2014, there were 3,638 loans serviced with balances of $275.4 million and as of December 2013, there were 3,684 loans serviced with balances of $282.1 million.\nThe impact of mortgage servicing rights to both noninterest income and expense is shown in the following table:\n Furniture and equipment steadily increases as we continue to add facilities and invest in technology. Annual maintenance costs continue to grow and become a greater piece of the overall cost. As new services are provided to our customers, the backroom cost to supply them continues to rise. The Company accepts it is an expected cost of doing business and keeping our services relevant to the industry.\nData processing expense increased $50 thousand during 2015 and by $38 thousand in 2014. The Company continues to investigate ways to reduce this expense. The pricing on many services, however, is based on number of accounts and the Bank fully expects those to increase with the growth from the newer offices and overall Bank growth.\nThe last line item with significant variation in noninterest expense to discuss is \u201cother general and administrative\u201d. The decrease of $348 thousand for 2015 as compared to 2014 can be mainly attributed to a $195.7 thousand reduction in marketing and consulting costs. A renegotiation of one service provider contract along with the maturity of another during 2015 lead to the decrease. Another contributor to the reduction was lower losses due to NSF and fraud. The Bank applauds the work of our front-line staff to recognize possible fraud and scams attempted on our customers and stopping them before they can occur. An investment in additional fraud detection software has also helped our back office personnel to detect possible digital fraud. This was down $60.2 thousand in 2015 compared to an increase in 2014 of $40.9 thousand.\nOther general and administrative was higher by $461 thousand in 2014. The fluctuation was not isolated to a single source. The primary factors impacting this fluctuation in 2014 are increases in both ATM expense and core deposit intangible expenses. The increased expense of $52.7 thousand relating to ATM and debit cards in 2015 and 2014 over the previous year is caused by many factors. Increased usage during both years corresponds to increases in both revenue and cost. Finally, fraud increases cost as new cards have to be issued to limit the risk exposure. The fraud losses themselves are not recognized in this breakout, however the cost of replacement cards is. The Bank is currently deploying chip technology within its cards; the Bank is aware the adoption of embedded chips will increase this expense in the coming years. 2014 experienced additional expense over 2013 in consulting ($161.7 thousand), audit and accounting fees ($166.5 thousand) and advertising ($101.3 thousand).\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nProvision expense decreased by $566 thousand for 2015, following an increase of $333 thousand for 2014. The decrease for 2015 was due to the consistent strong asset quality of the Bank's loan portfolio as evidenced by low levels of both net charge-offs and delinquencies. The increase for 2014 was needed to account for the loan growth and the net charge-off activity of 2014. Sustained strong asset quality kept the provision expense lower than the growth alone would have warranted. Net charge-offs were $473, $480 and $888 thousand for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Commercial and Industrial loans had the largest charge-off activity in 2015 and 2013, while 2014 was impacted with higher levels in the consumer portfolios.\nThe Company segregates its Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) into two reserves: The ACL and the Allowance for Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit (AULC). When combined, these reserves constitute the total ACL. The AUCL is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Bank's ALLL methodology captures trends in leading, current, and lagging indicators which will directly affect the Bank's allocation amount. The Bank monitors trends in such leading indicators as delinquency, unemployment changes in the Bank's service area, experience and ability of staff, regulatory trends, and credit concentrations. A current indicator such as the total watch list loan amount to Capital, and a lagging indicator such as the charge off amount are referenced as well. A matrix formed by loan type from these indicators is used in making ALLL adjustments.\nWatch list loan balances are comprised of loans graded 5-8. These loan balances decreased 53.6% or $7.2 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. The balances decreased mainly due to successful results from collection efforts. Given the size of the decrease, it is no surprise it is attributed mainly to the commercial real estate portfolio decreasing by $5.9 million. Three customers made up the bulk of the balances with one of three finding funding elsewhere. Commercial loans (non-real estate) on the Bank's watch list also had a nice decrease during 2015, though just not as high at $1.9 million.\nOf the aggregate watch list loan balances, as of December 31, 2015, special mention accounted for 36.6% with substandard comprising 49.1% and doubtful accounting for the final 14.3%. In comparison to 2014, special mention was down $7.2 million, substandard up slightly by $161 thousand and doubtful down almost exactly the same amount at $162 thousand.\nSpecial mention loan balances increased 21.2% or $1.7 million overall as of yearend 2014 compared to same date 2013. The increase was in the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios. The largest increase of $2.1 million was in the commercial real estate, which was caused mainly by one large relationship being downgraded. Agricultural real estate decreased $618 thousand, thereby offsetting the above-referenced increase.\nFor 2014, the increase in special mention is offset by significant decreases in the substandard classifications of those same commercial related portfolios. Overall, substandard and doubtful loans decreased 42.5% or $2.9 million as compared to yearend 2013. In response to these fluctuations and loan growth during 2014 and 2015, the Bank changed ALLL to outstanding loan coverage percentage changed to 0.88% as of December 31, 2015, 0.95% as of December 31, 2014 from and 0.90% as of December 31, 2013.\nThe above indicators are reviewed quarterly. Some of the indicators are quantifiable and, as such, will automatically adjust the ALLL once calculated. These indicators include the ratio of past due loans to total loans, loans past due greater than 30 days, and the ration of watch list loans to capital, with the watch list made up of loans graded 5, 6 or 7 on a scale of 1 (best) to 7 (worst). Other indicators use more subjective data to the extent possible to evaluate the potential for inherent losses in the Bank's loan portfolio. For example, the economic indicator uses the unemployment statistics from the communities in our market area to help determine whether the ALLL should be adjusted. At the end of each of 2013, 2014 and 2015, a slight improvement was noted in unemployment figures.\nAll aggregate commercial and agricultural credits including real estate loans of $250,000 and over are reviewed annually by both credit committees and internal loan review to look for early signs of deterioration.\nTo establish the specific reserve allocation for real estate, a discount to the market value is established to account for liquidation expenses. The discounting percentage used for real estate mirrors the discounting of real estate as provided for in the Bank's Loan Policy. However, unique or unusual circumstances may be present which will affect the real estate value and, when appropriately identified, can adjust the discounting percentage at the discretion of management.\nThe ACL increased $153 and $755 thousand during 2015 and 2014 respectively, which was preceded by a $29 thousand decrease during 2013. The large increase in 2014 directly correlates to the large increase in loan balances. With the improved asset quality, the metrics upon which the ACL is calculated did not support a larger increase in 2015 even though loan growth occurred. The percentage of ACL to the total loan portfolio was 0.93% as of December 31, 2013, 0.98% as of December 31, 2014 and 0.91% as of December 31, 2015. December 31, 2013 had the lowest loans past due 30+ day percentage at 0.25% in the Bank's known history, December 31, 2014 and 2015 were still at respectable lows of 0.37% and 0.32%.\nPlease see Note 4 in the consolidated financial statement for additional tables regarding the composition of the ACL.\nFederal Income Taxes\nEffective tax rates were 26.97%, 28.64% and 28.53% for 2015, 2014 and 2013 respectively. The effect of tax-exempt interest from holding tax-exempt securities and Industrial Development Bonds (IDBs) was $554, $634, and $640 thousand for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. All years included an increase into a higher tax bracket for income over $10 million. Behind the decrease in 2015 is one of the benefits from the establishment of the Captive subsidiary.\nMaterial Changes in Financial Condition\nThe shifts in the balance sheet during 2015 and 2014 have positioned the Company for continued improvement in profitability. On the asset side, the Company experiences an increase in interest income due to loan growth with funding provided by a decrease in the investment portfolio, core deposit growth and 2015 also utilized other borrowings. The cost of funds was impacted by the shift of interest bearing liabilities to noninterest and the decrease in time deposits and other borrowed money as borrowings didn't increase until December 2015. Both contributed to improved profitability in 2015 and 2014 and leads to expected liabilities improvement in future years.\nAverage earning assets increased throughout 2015 and 2014. Loan growth in both years was the main factor. 2014 was also aided by the Custar acquisition which took place in December 2013 and brought in $29 million in deposits. 2015 also had the addition of the Sylvania office for a full year along with the growth in the other newer offices.\nSecurities\nThe investment portfolio is primarily used to provide overall liquidity for the Bank. It is also used to provide required collateral for pledging to the Bank's Ohio public depositors for amounts on deposit in excess of the FDIC coverage limits. It may also be used to pledge for additional borrowings from third parties. Investments are made with the above criteria in mind while still seeking a fair market rate of return, and looking for maturities that fall within the projected overall strategy of the Bank. The possible need to fund growth is also a consideration.\nAll of the Bank's security portfolio is categorized as available for sale and as such is recorded at market value.\nSecurity balances as of December 31 are summarized below:\n The following table sets forth the maturities of investment securities as of December 31, 2015 and the weighted average yields of such securities calculated on the basis of cost and effective yields weighted for the scheduled maturity of each security. Tax-equivalent adjustments, using a thirty-four percent rate, have been made in yields on obligations of state and political subdivisions. Stocks of domestic corporations have not been included.\n As of December 31, 2015 the Bank did not hold a large block of any one investment security in excess of 10% of stockholders' equity. The largest segment of holdings is in US Governments. The Bank also holds stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati at a cost of $3.7 million. This is required in order to obtain Federal Home Loan Bank loans. The Bank also owns stock of Farmer Mac with a carrying value of $37.4 thousand which is required to participate loans in the program.\nLoan Portfolio\nThe Bank's various loan portfolios are subject to varying levels of credit risk. Management mitigates these risks through portfolio diversification and through standardization of lending policies and procedures.\nRisks are mitigated through an adherence to the Bank's loan policies, with any exception being recorded and approved by senior management or committees comprised of senior management. The Bank's loan policies define parameters to essential underwriting guidelines such as loan-to-value ratio, cash flow and debt-to-income ratio, loan requirements and covenants, financial information tracking, collection practice and others. The maximum loan amount to any one borrower is limited by the Bank's legal lending limits and is stated in policy. On a broader basis, the Bank restricts total aggregate funding in comparison to Bank capital to any one business or agricultural sector by an approved sector percentage to capital limitation.\nThe following table shows the Bank's loan portfolio by category of loan as of December 31st of each year, including loans held for sale:\n The following table shows the maturity of loans as of December 31, 2015:\n The following table presents the total of loans due after one year which has either 1) predetermined interest rates (fixed) or 2) floating or adjustable interest rates (variable):\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's nonaccrual, past due 90 days or more and still accruing loans, and accruing troubled debt restructurings as of December 31 for each of the last five years:\n Although loans may be classified as non-performing, some pay on a regular basis, and many continue to pay interest irregularly or at less than original contractual rates. Interest income that would have been recorded under the original terms of these loans would have aggregated $117.1 thousand for 2015, $52.3 thousand for 2014 and $139.1 thousand for 2013. Any collections of interest on nonaccrual loans are included in interest income when collected unless it is on an impaired loan with a specific allocation. A collection of interest on an impaired loan with a specific allocation is applied to the loan balance to decrease the allocation. Total interest collections, whether on an accrued or cash basis, amounted to $76 thousand for 2015, $87 thousand for 2014 and $60 thousand for 2013. $20.6 thousand of interest collected in 2015 was applied to reduce the specific allocation and was applied for the same reason in 2014.\nLoans are placed on nonaccrual status in the event that the loan is in past due status for more than 90 days or payment in full of principal and interest is not expected. The Bank had nonaccrual loan balances of $2.1 million at December 31, 2015 compared to balances of $3.3 and $1.7 million as of year-end 2013 and 2014, respectively. All of the balances of nonaccrual loans for the past three years were collaterally secured.\nAs of December 31, 2015 the Bank had $7.0 million of loans which it considers to be \u201cpotential problem loans\u201d in that the borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties. At December 31, 2014, the Bank had $13.5 million of these loans. These loans are subject to constant management attention and are reviewed at least monthly. The amount of the potential problem loans was considered in management's review of the loan loss reserve at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nIn extending credit to families, businesses and governments, banks accept a measure of risk against which an allowance for possible loan loss is established by way of expense charges to earnings. This expense is determined by management based on a detailed monthly review of the risk factors affecting the loan portfolio, including general economic conditions, changes in the portfolio mix, past due loan-loss experience and the financial condition of the bank's borrowers.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Bank had loans outstanding to individuals and firms engaged in the various fields of agriculture in the amount of $82.8 million with an additional $58.5 million in agricultural real estate loans these compared to $74.6 and $50.9 million respectively as of December 31, 2014. The ratio of this segment of loans to the total loan portfolio is not considered unusual for a bank engaged in and servicing rural communities.\nInterest rate modification to reflect a decrease in market interest rates or maintain a relationship with the debtor, where the debtor is not experiencing financial difficulty and can obtain funding from other sources, is not considered a troubled debt restructuring. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank had $1.1 million of its loans that were classified as troubled debt restructurings, of which $182.4 thousand are included in non-accrual loans. This compares to $797.2 thousand as of same date 2014 and the Bank had almost $911.2 thousand classified as such as of December 31, 2013.\nUpdated appraisals are required on all collateral dependent loans once they are deemed impaired. The Bank may also require an updated appraisal of a watch list loan which the Bank monitors under their loan policy. On a quarterly basis, Bank management reviews properties supporting asset dependent loans to consider market events that may indicate a change in value has occurred.\nTo determine observable market price, collateral asset values securing an impaired loan are periodically evaluated. Maximum time of re-evaluation is every 12 months for chattels and titled vehicles and every two years for real estate. In this process, third party evaluations are obtained and heavily relied upon. Until such time that updated appraisals are received, the Bank may discount the existing collateral value used.\nPerforming \u201cnon-watch list\u201d loans secured in whole or in part by real estate, do not require an updated appraisal unless the loan is rewritten and additional funds advanced. Watch List loans secured in whole or in part by real estate require updated appraisals every two years. All loans are subject to loan to values as found in the Bank's loan policies irrespective of their grade. The Bank's watch list is reviewed on a quarterly basis by management and any questions to value are addressed at that time.\nThe majority of the Bank's loans are made in the market by lenders who live and work in the market. Thus, their evaluation of the independent valuation is also valuable and serves as a double check.\nOn extremely rare occasions, the Bank will make adjustments to the recorded values of collateral securing commercial real estate loans without acquiring an updated appraisal for the subject property. The Bank has no formalized policy for determining when collateral value adjustments between regularly scheduled appraisals are necessary, nor does it use any specific methodology for applying such adjustments. However, on a quarterly basis as part of its normal operations, the Bank's senior management and the Loan Review Committee will meet to review all commercial credits either deemed to be impaired or on the Bank's watch list. In addition to analyzing the recent performance of these loans, management and the Enterprise Risk Management Committee will also consider any general market conditions that might warrant adjustments to the value of particular real estate collateralizing commercial loans. In addition, management conducts annual reviews of all commercial loans exceeding certain outstanding balance thresholds. In each of these situations, any information available to management regarding market conditions impacting a specific property or other relevant factors are considered, and lenders familiar with a particular commercial real estate loan and the underlying collateral may be present to provide their opinion on such factors. If the available information leads management to conclude a valuation adjustment is warranted, such an adjustment may be applied on the basis of the information available. If management concludes that an adjustment is warranted but lacks the specific information needed to reasonably quantify the adjustment, management will order a new appraisal on the subject property even though one may not be required under the Bank's general policies for updating appraisal.\nNote 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements may also be reviewed for additional tables dealing with the Bank's loans and ALLL.\nALLL is evaluated based on an assessment of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio. This assessment results in an allowance consisting of two components, allocated and unallocated.\nManagement considers several different risk assessments in determining ALLL. The allocated component of ALLL reflects expected losses resulting from an analysis of individual loans, developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and historical loss experience for each loan category. For those loans where the internal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification and management can reasonably estimate the loss that will be sustained based upon collateral, the borrowers operating activity and economic conditions in which the borrower operates, a specific allocation is made. For those borrowers that are not currently behind in their payment, but for which management believes, based on economic conditions and operating activities of the borrower, the possibility exists for future collection problems, a reserve is established. The amount of reserve allocated to each loan portfolio is based on past loss experiences and the different levels of risk within each loan portfolio. The historical loan loss portion is determined using a historical loss analysis by loan category.\nThe unallocated portion of the reserve for loan losses is determined based on management's assessment of general economic conditions as well as specific economic factors in the Bank's marketing area. This assessment inherently involves a higher degree of uncertainty. It represents estimated inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio that are probable due to uncertainties in economic conditions, delays in obtaining information, including unfavorable information about a borrower's financial condition and other current risk factors that may not have yet manifested themselves in the Bank's historical loss factors used to determine the allocated component of the allowance.\nActual charge-off of loan balances is based upon periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio by management. These evaluations consider several factors, including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, financial condition of the borrower, and collateral.\nAs presented below, charge-offs increased to $1.0 million for 2015, preceded by a decrease to $778 thousand for 2014, an increase to $1.3 million for 2013, decreased to $891 thousand for 2012 and 2011 recorded $2.7 million. The provision expense also decreased in 2012 and 2011 and increased for 2013 and 2014. 2015 had the lowest provision expense of all years presented at $625 thousand. 2014 and 2013 had provision expense of $1.2 million and $858 thousand respectively. 2012 had provision expense of $738 thousand with 2011 having provision expense of $1.7 million. The Commercial and Industrial portfolio had the largest net charge-off position in 2011 through 2015. The improvement in asset quality during the periods shown is reflected in the increased percentage of the allowance for loan loss to nonperforming loans.\nIn reviewing the bigger picture of the allowance for credit loss, the years with the higher percentage of ACL to total nonperforming loans ratio account for the lower level of nonaccrual and watch list loans. This demonstrates the extended time period with which it has taken to achieve resolution and/or collection of these loans. In 2012, the provision expense was to offset the higher year-end watch list values. A smaller portion of the allowance was needed to fund the impaired loans as collateral remained sufficient to cover the outstanding amounts in most cases. 2014's significant and continued loan growth since fourth quarter 2013 was the reason behind 2014's higher balances as asset quality remained strong. The ratio of ACL to nonperforming loans increased significantly in 2014 which is why provision loan expense was lower in 2015 in comparison. The ACL to nonperforming loans for 2015 remained more than adequate and emphasizes the existing strong level of credit quality.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the allowance for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011:\n\n * Nonperforming loans are defined as all loans on nonaccrual, plus any loans past due 90 days not on nonaccrual. \nAllocation of ALLL per Loan Category in terms of dollars and percentage of loans in each category to total loans is as follows:\n Deposits\nThe amount of outstanding time certificates of deposits and other time deposits in amounts of $100,000 or more by maturity as of December 31, 2015 are as follows:\n The following table presents the average amount of and average rate paid on each deposit category:\n\nLiquidity\nLiquidity remains adequate though down from prior years as the Bank has decreased the investment portfolio to fund loans. The Bank has access to $58 million of unsecured borrowings through correspondent banks and $29.4 million of unpledged securities which may be sold or used as collateral. An additional $4.1 million is also available from the Federal Home Loan Bank based on current collateral pledging with up to $118.5 million available provided adequate collateral is pledged.\nMaintaining sufficient funds to meet depositor and borrower needs on a daily basis continues to be among management's top priorities. This is accomplished not only by immediate liquid resources of cash, due from banks and federal funds sold, but also by the Bank's available for sale securities portfolio. The average aggregate balance of these assets was $262.1 for 2015 and $296.5 million for 2014, and $387.7 million for 2013. This represented 28.0%, 31.8% and 42.5% of total average assets, respectively. Of the almost $218.7 million of debt securities in the bank's portfolio as of December 31, 2015, $12.7 million, or 5.8% of the portfolio, is expected to receive payments or mature in 2016. The availability of the funds may be reduced by the need to utilize securities for pledging purposes on public deposits. This liquidity provides the opportunity to fund loan growth by analysis of the lowest cost and source of funds whether by increasing deposits, sales or runoff of investments or utilizing debt.\nIn addition to the Bank's investment portfolio, the Company has $16.4 million held in the holding company's investment portfolio. $1.5 million of those investments will mature or receive payments in the next twelve months. These funds provide liquidity to the Company. The Bank has been declaring additional dividends each quarter to provide this liquidity to the Company. In future years, the Captive will also upstream dividends to the Company once reserve levels are adequately provided for. This will also provide additional liquidity for Company activities.\nHistorically, the primary source of liquidity has been core deposits that include noninterest bearing and interest bearing demand deposits, savings, money market accounts and time deposits of individuals. Core deposit balances as of year-end 2015 increased in all categories with the exception of time deposits. Overall deposits increased an average of $2.6 million in 2015, $913 thousand in 2014 and $4.7 million during 2013. The Bank also utilized Federal Funds purchased at times during 2013 through 2015. The average balance for 2015 and 2014 was $1.2 million and $1.4 million respectively. The Bank began using this temporary funding source heavier in December 2015 while it secured more permanent funding.\nHistorically, the primary use of new funds is placing the funds back into the community through loans for the acquisition of new homes, consumer products and for business development. The use of new funds for loans is measured by the loan to deposit ratio. The Bank's average loan to deposit ratio was 80.7% for 2015, 76.4% for 2014 and 66.2% for 2013. The lower ratio in 2013 was due to the success of the deposit gathering function, the residential mortgage loans being sold in the secondary market and the lack of loan demand. The Bank's goal is for this ratio to be higher in the 80-90 percent range with loan growth being the driver. The Bank ended the year 2015 at an 88.1% loan to deposit ratio.\nShort-term debt such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase also provides the Company with liquidity. Short-term debt for both federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase amounted to $78.8 million at the end of 2015 compared to $56.0 million at the end of 2014 and $69.8 million at the end of 2013. These accounts are used to provide a sweep product to the Bank's commercial customers.\n\u201cOther borrowings\u201d are also a source of funds. Other borrowings consist of loans from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati. These funds are then used to provide loans in our community. The Bank utilized this funding source in December 2015 by borrowing $10 million. Prior borrowings from this source had decreased by $4.5 million to none at December 31, 2014. This compares to decreased borrowings during 2013 of $7.1 million. The decreased borrowings were payoffs of matured notes in 2013 and 2014.\nAsset/Liability Management\nThe primary functions of asset/liability management are to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. It involves the management of the balance sheet mix, maturities, re-pricing characteristics and pricing components to provide an adequate and stable net interest margin with an acceptable level of risk. Interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates.\nChanges in net income, other than those related to volume arise when interest rates on assets re-price in a time frame or interest rate environment that is different from that of the re-pricing period for liabilities. Changes in net interest income also arise from changes in the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nHistorically, the Bank has maintained liquidity through cash flows generated in the normal course of business, loan repayments, maturing earning assets, the acquisition of new deposits, and borrowings. The Bank's asset and liability management program is designed to maximize net interest income over the long term while taking into consideration both credit and interest rate risk. Interest rate sensitivity varies with different types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Overnight federal funds on which rates change daily and loans that are tied to the market rate differ considerably from long-term investment securities and fixed rate loans. Similarly, time deposits over $100,000 and money market certificates are much more interest rate sensitive than passbook savings accounts. The Bank utilizes shock analysis to examine the amount of exposure an instant rate change of 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points in both increasing and decreasing directions would have on the financials. Acceptable ranges of earnings and equity at risk are established and decisions are made to maintain those levels based on the shock results.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the Company's operations. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all the assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Company's performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and service.\nContractual Obligations\nContractual Obligations of the Company totaled $252.1 million as of December 31, 2015. Time deposits represent contractual agreements for certificates of deposits held by its customers. Long term debt represents the borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank and is further defined in Note 4 and 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n Capital Resources\nStockholders' equity was $120.1 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to $114.5 million at December 31, 2014. Dividends declared during 2015 were $0.87 per share totaling $3.99 million and during 2014 were $0.84 per share totaling $3.86 million. During 2015, the Company purchased 30,685 shares and awarded 16,000 shares of restricted stock to 67 employees. During 2014, the Company purchased 23,570 shares and awarded 13,250 restricted shared to 61 employees. For a summary of activity as it relates to the Company's restricted stock awards, please refer to Note 11: Employee Benefit Plans in the consolidated financial statements. At yearend 2015, the Company held 587,466 shares in Treasury stock and 38,995 unvested shares of restricted stock. At yearend 2014, the Company held 572,662 shares in Treasury stock and 33,390 unvested shares of restricted stock. On January 15, 2016 the Company announced the authorization by its Board of Directors for the Company's repurchase, either on the open market, or in privately negotiated transactions, of up to 200,000 shares of its outstanding common stock commencing January 15, 2016 and ending December 31, 2016. The Company has a history of approving a similar resolution to be in effect each year for at least the last five years.\nThe Company continues to have a strong capital base and maintains regulatory capital ratios that are above the defined regulatory capital ratios. At December 31, 2015, the Bank and the Company had total risk-based capital ratios of 12.64% and 14.95%, respectively. Core capital to risk-based asset ratios of 11.87% and 14.18% for the Bank and the Company, respectively, are well in excess of regulatory guidelines. The Bank's leverage ratio of 10.12% is also substantially in excess of regulatory guidelines, as is the Company's at 11.91%. Under Basel III, the common equity Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets ratios are also well above the required 4.50% and the 6.50% well capitalized levels with the Company at 14.18% and the Bank at 11.87%. For further discussion and analysis of regulatory capital requirements, refer to Note 15 of the Audited Financial Statements.\nThe Company's subsidiaries are restricted by regulations from making dividend distributions in excess of certain prescribed amounts. Upon prior regulatory approval, the Bank may be allowed to pay above the prescribed amount.", "item_7_tables": "Table 31: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

report:\n\nOverview\n- The company experienced record earnings in 2015 with net income over $10 million, up 7.2% from 2014. This was driven by increased loan balances, new product offerings, and continued strong asset quality.\n\nLoans & Credit Quality  \n- Total loans grew by $63.8 million in 2015 and $46 million in 2014. Asset quality remains very strong as evidenced by low delinquencies and net charge-offs. \n- The allowance for loan losses is considered adequate and stood at 0.88% of total loans at year-end 2015.\n\nDeposits & Liquidity\n- Total deposits increased an average of $2.6 million in 2015. The company has adequate liquidity including $16.4 million held at the holding company.\n\nNet Interest Income\n- Net interest income improved by $326 thousand in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by loan growth. This followed an increase of $3.2 million from 2013 to 2014.\n\nNoninterest Income & Expense\n- Noninterest income increased $604 thousand in 2015 after decreasing $654 thousand in 2014. This was partly due to higher mortgage servicing fees.\n- Noninterest expenses increased 3.4% in 2015 and 4.2% in 2014, mostly attributable to higher salaries and employee benefits.\n\nCapital \n- Equity increased to $120.1 million at year-end 2015.
