Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following management discussion and analysis ( MD&A\u201d) provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. We provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level. We also provide quantitative information regarding special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. Such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature. Qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance.\nThe discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This discussion contains various Non-GAAP Financial Measures and also contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d at the end of this MD&A, and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d within Items 1 and 1A of this Form 10-K. We also refer readers to the tables within the section entitled Results of Operations\u201d of this MD&A for reconciliation information of Non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP.\nComparability of Results\nPurolite acquisition\nOn December 1, 2021, we acquired Purolite for total consideration of $3.7 billion in cash. Purolite is a leading and fast-growing global provider of high-end ion exchange resins for the separation and purification of solutions for pharmaceutical and industrial applications. Headquartered in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, Purolite operates in more than 30 countries. Purolite is reported within our Life Sciences operating segment. Acquisition and integration charges are recorded within special (gains) and charges.\nIn addition, the remaining impacts of the Purolite acquisition including operating results, acquisition-related amortization and interest expense related to the transaction have also been excluded from adjusted results.\nChampionX Transaction\nOn June 3, 2020, we completed the previously announced separation of our Upstream Energy business (the ChampionX business\u201d) in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the Transaction\u201d) through the split-off of ChampionX Holding Inc. ( ChampionX\u201d), formed by Ecolab as a wholly owned subsidiary to hold the ChampionX Business, followed immediately by the merger of ChampionX (the Merger\u201d) with a wholly owned subsidiary of ChampionX Corporation (f/k/a Apergy Corporation, Apergy\u201d).\nThe ChampionX business met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations because the separation of ChampionX was a strategic shift in business that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, we report the historical results of ChampionX, including the results of operations, cash flows, and related assets and liabilities, as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein. Unless otherwise noted, the accompanying MD&A has been revised to reflect the ChampionX business as discontinued operations and prior year balances have been revised accordingly to reflect continuing operations only.\nComparability of Reportable Segments\nEffective in the first quarter of 2020, and in anticipation of the separation of the Upstream Energy business, we created the Upstream and Downstream operating segments from the Global Energy operating segment, which was also a reportable segment. Subsequent to the separation of ChampionX, we no longer report the Upstream Energy segment, which previously held the ChampionX business.\nThe Downstream operating segment has been aggregated into the Global Industrial reportable segment. Also, in the first quarter of 2020, we announced leadership changes which allow for shared oversight and focus on the Healthcare and Life Sciences operating segments and established the Global Healthcare & Life Sciences reportable segment. This segment is comprised of the Healthcare operating segment which was previously aggregated in the Global Institutional reportable segment and the Life Sciences operating segment which was previously aggregated in the Global Industrial reportable segment. Additionally, the Textile Care operating segment, which is now being reported in Other, had previously been aggregated in the Global Industrial reportable segment. We also renamed the Global Institutional reportable segment to the Global Institutional & Specialty reportable segment. We made other immaterial changes, including the movement of certain customers and cost allocations between reportable segments.\nImpact of Acquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture and the Venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods. As part of the separation, we also entered into a Master Cross Supply and Product Transfer agreement with ChampionX to provide, receive or transfer certain products for a period up to 36 months. Sales of product to ChampionX under this agreement are recorded in product and equipment sales in the Corporate segment along with the related cost of sales. These transactions are removed from the consolidated results as part of the calculation of the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.\nFixed Currency Foreign Exchange Rates\nManagement evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations. Fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into U.S. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. Public currency rate data provided within the Segment Performance\u201d section of this MD&A reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period and is provided for informational purposes only.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nIn 2021, we delivered strong sales performance in an environment where COVID-19 infections impacted business activity and further disrupted global supply chains which together, impacted the global recovery. Delivered product cost inflation and other supply constraints increased significantly but we undertook extraordinary measures to assure our customers were supplied with our critical products and services. Double-digit sales growth in the Institutional & Specialty and Other segments along with strong Industrial segment growth more than offset the Healthcare & Life Sciences segment's decline versus a very strong gain last year. Accelerating pricing and higher volume more than offset significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints, including the impact of Texas Freeze and Hurricane Ida, and the comparison to lower variable compensation last year.\nSales\nReported sales increased 8% to $12.7 billion in 2021 from $11.8 billion in 2020. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales increased 6% compared to the prior year. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increased 5% compared to the prior year.\nGross Margin\nOur reported gross margin was 40.2% of sales for 2021, compared to our 2020 reported gross margin of 41.4%. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and impacts from the Purolite transaction included in cost of sales from both 2021 and 2020, our adjusted gross margin was 40.9% in 2021 and 41.8% in 2020.\nOperating Income\nReported operating income increased 15% to $1.6 billion in 2021, compared to $1.4 billion in 2020. Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the impacts of the Purolite transaction, increased 11% in 2021. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 8% in 2021.\nEarnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Ecolab Per Common Share ( EPS\u201d)\nReported continuing operations diluted EPS increased 17% to $3.91 in 2021 compared to $3.33 in 2020. Special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years. Special (gains) and charges in 2021 include COVID-19 related charges, restructuring charges, debt refinancing charges, acquisition and integration charges, and litigation and other charges. Special (gains) and charges in 2020 include debt refinancing charges, restructuring charges, disposal and impairment charges, Healthcare product recall charges, acquisition and integration charges, COVID-19 related charges, and litigation and other charges. Special (gains) and charges in 2019 were driven primarily by the impact of restructuring charges, discrete tax items, acquisition and integration charges and litigation and other charges. The impact of the Purolite transaction was $0.02 per share dilutive to reported earnings per share from continuing operations (excluding special charges) as sales since its December 1, 2021 acquisition were more than offset by acquisition-related amortization and interest expense. Adjusted continuing operations diluted EPS, which exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, the impacts of the Purolite transaction and discrete tax items increased 17% to $4.69 in 2021 compared to $4.02 in 2020.\nBalance Sheet\nWe remain committed to maintaining A\u201d range ratings metrics over the long-term, supported by our current credit ratings of A-/A3/A- by Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investor Services and Fitch, respectively. Our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates.\nNet Debt to EBITDA\nOur net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) was 3.4 and 2.4 for 2021 and 2020, respectively. We view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. See the Net Debt to EBITDA\u201d table on page 44 for reconciliation information.\nCash Flow\nCash flow from continuing operations operating activities was $2.1 billion in 2021 compared to $1.7 billion in 2020. We continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, investments in our business, acquisitions, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments.\nDividends\nWe increased our quarterly cash dividend 6% in December 2021, bringing annual dividends declared to $1.95 per share. The increase represents our 30th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 85th consecutive year we have paid cash dividends. Our outstanding dividend history reflects our long term growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ( Notes\u201d).\nPreparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. As the impact of the pandemic continues to evolve, estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require judgment. These estimates and assumptions may change in future periods and will be recognized in the consolidated financial\ninformation as new events occur and additional information becomes known. To the extent actual results differ materially from those estimates and assumptions, our future financial statements could be affected.\nBesides estimates that meet the critical\u201d estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even from estimates not deemed critical. Our critical accounting estimates include the following:\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing service. Revenue from product and sold equipment is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of the product or delivery of the equipment. Revenue from service and leased equipment is recognized when the services are provided, or the customer receives the benefit from the leased equipment, which is over time. Service revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method and aligns with when the services are provided. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date because the effort provided by the field selling and service organization represents services provided, which corresponds with the transfer of control. Revenue for leased equipment is accounted for under Topic 842 Leases and recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease contract.\nOur revenue policies do not provide for general rights of return. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives based primarily on historical experience and anticipated performance over the contract period. Depending on market conditions, we may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive. We also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits based on specific circumstances and credit conditions. We record an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on our estimates of expected future credit losses.\nThe revenue standard can be applied to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics if it is reasonable that the effects of applying the standard at the portfolio would not be significantly different than applying the standard at the individual contract level. We apply the portfolio approach primarily within each operating segment by geographical region. Application of the portfolio approach was focused on those characteristics that have the most significant accounting consequences in terms of their effect on the timing of revenue recognition or the amount of revenue recognized. We determined the key criteria to assess with respect to the portfolio approach, including the related deliverables, the characteristics of the customers and the timing and transfer of goods and services, which most closely aligned within the operating segments. In addition, the accountability for the business operations, as well as the operational decisions on how to go to market and the product offerings, are performed at the operating segment level. For additional information on revenue recognition, refer to Note 18.\nLitigation and Environmental Liabilities\nOur business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. Some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations.\nWe record liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs. We record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses. Expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain. While the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals, and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position. For additional information on our commitments and contingencies, refer to Note 16.\nActuarially Determined Liabilities\nPension and Postretirement Healthcare Benefit Plans\nThe measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries. These assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses.\nThe significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate, expected return on assets, projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table.\nTable 69: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>The discount rate assumptions for our U.S. plans are assessed using a yield curve constructed from a subset of bonds yielding greater than the median return from a population of non-callable, corporate bond issues that have an average rating of AA when averaging available Moody's Investor Services, Standard & Poor's and Fitch ratings. The discount rate is calculated by matching the plans' projected cash flows to the bond yield curve. For 2021 and 2020, we measured service and interest costs by applying the </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows. We believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans' liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. In determining our U.S. pension obligations for 2021, our weighted-average discount rate increased to 2.86% from 2.48% at year-end 2020. In determining our U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2021, our weighted-average discount rate increased to 2.75% from 2.37% at year-end 2020. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>The expected rate of return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategies and views of investment advisors, and represents our expected long-term return on plan assets. Our weighted-average expected return on U.S. plan assets used in determining the U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care expenses was 7.00% for 2021, 7.25% for 2020 and 7.25% for 2019. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>Projected salary and health care cost increases are based on our long-term actual experience, the near-term outlook and assumed inflation.

The rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 4.5% in 2029 and remain at those levels thereafter. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>In determining our U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2021, we utilized the most recent mortality table, MP-2021 projection scale (applied to the Pri-2012 mortality table). </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe effects of actual results differing from our assumptions, as well as changes in assumptions, are reflected in the unrecognized actuarial loss and amortized over future periods and, therefore, will generally affect our recognized expense in future periods. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations and expense. The unrecognized net actuarial loss on our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans decreased to $397 million as of December 31, 2021 from $691 million as of December 31, 2020 (both before tax), primarily due to current year net actuarial gains.\nThe effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of December 31, 2021, on the December 31, 2021 defined benefit obligation and 2022 expense is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant U.S. plans. Expense amounts reflect the accounting for actuarial gains as a component of other comprehensive income and recognition of the impacts into income over the remaining service period:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect on U.S. Pension Plans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Higher\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Recorded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-0.25 pts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $65.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-0.25 pts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect on U.S. Postretirement\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Health Care Benefits Plans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Higher\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Recorded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-0.25 pts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-0.25 pts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans, with the majority of the amounts held in the U.K. and Eurozone countries. We use assumptions similar to our U.S. plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations, however, the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information.\nRefer to Note 17 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations.\nSelf-Insurance\nGlobally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses. We are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles, subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. We are self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. We determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis.\nIncome Taxes\nJudgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions.\nEffective Income Tax Rate\nOur effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions. We recognize the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances.\nTax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. As a result, the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities and Valuation Allowances\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of available evidence, both positive and negative, we recognize tax assets, such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not. Relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results, sources of future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nA number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter, for which we have established a liability for uncertain tax position, is audited and finally resolved. The number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) has completed examinations of our U.S. federal income tax returns through 2016 and the years 2017 and 2018 are currently under audit. In addition to the U.S. federal examinations, we have ongoing audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.\nThe tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal, state and international jurisdictions. We believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations, and our liabilities for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken. Because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations, we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits (including related interest and penalties) for amounts that do not meet the more-likely-than-not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance. The liability for uncertain tax positions is reviewed throughout the year, taking into account new legislation, regulations, case law and audit results. Settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments or receipts and/or adjustments to tax expense. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets within other non-current liabilities. Our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $25 million and $21 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For additional information on income taxes refer to Note 13.\nLong-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nLong-Lived and Amortizable Intangible Assets\nLong-lived and amortizable intangible assets acquired are recorded on the acquisition date at their respective fair values based on the fair value requirements defined in U.S. GAAP. This requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions relating to the present value of its future cash flows, such as growth rates, royalty rates or discount rates.\nWe review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $6.8 billion and $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for impairment when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the manner in which asset or asset groups are being used or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset or asset group. Impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset's or assets group's carrying amount over its estimated fair value.\nWe use the straight-line method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets, including our customer relationships. We consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships, including projected sales data, customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships.\nGlobally, we have a broad customer base. Our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions, including the customer bases acquired from our Nalco, Anios, CID Lines and Purolite transactions, which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships. Our historical retention rate, coupled with our consistent track record of keeping long-term relationships with our customers, supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer bases. If our customer retention rates or other post-acquisition operational activities change materially, we would evaluate the financial impact and significances of the events given rise to the change which could result in impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets, or absent an impairment, an acceleration of amortization.\nIn addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. Changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. We have experienced no significant changes in the carrying amount or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets.\nGoodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets\nWe had total goodwill of $8.1 billion and $6.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter. Our reporting units are aligned with our eleven operating segments.\nFor our annual 2021 goodwill impairment assessment, we completed a quantitative impairment assessment for each of our eleven reporting units using discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated assumptions, including future operating performance, long-term growth, and discount rates. Our goodwill impairment assessments for 2021 indicated the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying amounts of the respective reporting units by a significant margin. We assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may be higher than its fair value. Additionally, no events noted during the second half of 2021 indicated a need to update any of our analyses or conclusions reached in the second quarter of 2021 for any of our eleven reporting units. There has been no impairment of goodwill in any of the periods presented.\nThe Nalco trade name is our only indefinite life intangible asset. During the second quarter of 2021, we completed our annual impairment assessment of the Nalco trade name using the relief from royalty discounted cash flow method, which incorporates assumptions, including future sales projections, royalty rates and discount rates. Our Nalco tradename impairment assessment for 2021 indicated the estimated fair value of the Nalco trade name exceeded its $1.2 billion carrying amount by a significant margin. There has been no impairment of the Nalco trade name intangible since it was acquired.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\nTable 77: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Our gross margin is defined as sales less cost of sales divided by sales.\nOur reported gross margin was 40.2%, 41.4%, and 43.9% for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our 2021, 2020 and 2019 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special (gains) and charges of $93.9 million, $48.2 million, and $38.5 million, respectively. Special (gains) and charges items impacting COS are shown within the Special (Gains) and Charges\u201d table below.\nExcluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the impacts of the Purolite transaction, our 2021 adjusted gross margin was 40.9% compared against a 2020 adjusted gross margin of 41.8%. The decrease primarily reflected increased pricing and higher volumes which were more than offset by significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints, including the impact of the Texas Freeze and Hurricane Ida.\nExcluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our adjusted gross margin was 41.8% and 44.2% for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease primarily reflected the impact of lower volume, reduced operating leverage and unfavorable business mix, which more than offset pricing.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses ( SG&A\u201d)\nTable 80: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(percent)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decreased SG&A ratio (SG&A expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2021 against 2020 was driven primarily by higher net sales, cost savings initiatives and reduction in bad debt, partially offset by higher variable compensation compared to last year. The decreased SG&A ratio comparing 2020 against 2019 was driven primarily by lower incentive compensation, discretionary spend reductions and cost savings initiatives which offset the effects of lower

which is consistent with our internal management reporting.\nRestructuring Activities\nRestructuring activities are primarily related to the Institutional Advancement Program and Accelerate 2020, both of which are described below. These activities have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges, and other (income) expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFurther details related to our restructuring charges are included in Note 3.\nInstitutional Advancement Program\nWe approved a restructuring plan in 2020 focused on the Institutional business ( the Institutional Plan\u201d) which is intended to enhance our Institutional sales and service structure and allow the sales team to capture share and penetration while maximizing service effectiveness by leveraging our ongoing investments in digital technology. In February 2021, we expanded the Institutional Plan, and expect that these restructuring charges will be completed by 2023, with total anticipated costs of $65 million ($50 million after tax) or $0.17 per diluted share. The costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance and facility closures. We also anticipate non-cash charges related to equipment disposals. Actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken.\nIn 2021, we recorded total restructuring charges of $12.6 million ($10.2 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share, primarily related to severance, disposals of equipment and office closures. We have recorded $47.8 million ($36.6 million after tax), or $0.13 per diluted share of cumulative restructuring charges under the Institutional Plan. The liability related to the Institutional Plan was $5.1 million as of December 31, 2021. The majority of the pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters which continue to be funded from operating activities.\nThe Institutional Plan has delivered $41 million of cumulative cost savings with estimated annual cost savings of $50 million in continuing operations by 2024.\nAccelerate 2020\nDuring 2018, we formally commenced a restructuring plan Accelerate 2020 ( the Plan\u201d), to leverage technology and system investments and organizational changes. The goal of the Plan is to further simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidated facilities and focus on key long-term growth areas by further leveraging technology and structural improvements. During 2020, we expanded the Plan for additional costs and savings to further leverage the technology and structural improvements. Following the establishment of the separate Institutional Plan, we now expect that the restructuring activities will be completed by the end of 2022, with total anticipated costs of $255 million ($195 million after tax), or $0.67 per diluted share, over this period of time, when revised for continuing operations. Costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance costs and some facility closure costs relating to team reorganizations. Actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken.\nWe recorded restructuring charges of $5.3 million ($6.2 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share in 2021. The liability related to the Plan was $32.7 million as of the end of the year. We have recorded $244.5 million ($190.0 million after tax), or $0.66 per diluted share, of cumulative restructuring charges under the Plan. The majority of the pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters which continue to be funded from operating activities.\nThe Plan has delivered $300 million of cumulative cost savings with estimated annual cost savings of $315 million in continuing operations by 2022.\nOther Restructuring Activities\nDuring 2021, we incurred restructuring charges of $18.7 million ($17.0 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share, related to other immaterial restructuring activity. The charges primarily related to severance and asset write-offs.\nDuring 2020, we incurred restructuring charges of $1.8 million ($1.2 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, related to other immaterial restructuring plan. The charges are comprised of severance, facility closure costs, including asset disposals, and consulting fees.\nDuring 2019, net restructuring gains related to restructuring plans entered into prior to 2019 were $1.5 million ($1.1 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share.\nThe restructuring liability balance for all other restructuring plans excluding Accelerate 2020 and the Institutional Plan were $4.6 million and $5.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The reduction in liability was driven primarily by severance payments. The remaining liability is expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will continue to be funded from operating activities. Cash payments during 2021 related to all other restructuring plans excluding the Accelerate 2020 and Institutional Plan were $10.5 million.\nAcquisition and integration related costs\nAcquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2021 include $29.9 million ($23.5 million after tax) or $0.08 per diluted share. Charges are related to the Purolite Corporation ( Purolite\u201d), Copal Invest NV, including its primary operating entity CID Lines (collectively, CID Lines\u201d), and Bioquell PLC ( Bioquell\u201d) acquisitions and consist of integration costs and advisory and legal fees. Acquisition and integration costs reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2021 include $4.2 million ($3.3 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share and are related to the recognition of fair value step-up in the Purolite inventory. In conjunction with its acquisitions, we incurred $0.8 million ($0.6 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of special (gains) and charges reported in interest expense in 2021.\nDuring 2020, acquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income include $8.5 million ($6.9 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share. Charges are related to CID Lines, Bioquell and the Laboratoires Anios ( Anios\u201d) acquisitions and consist of integration costs and advisory and legal fees. Acquisition and integration costs reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2020 include $3.9 million ($3.2 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share and are related to the recognition of fair value step-up in the CID Lines inventory, severance and the closure of a facility. In conjunction with our acquisitions, we incurred $0.7 million ($0.6 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of special (gains) and charges reported in interest expense in 2020.\nDuring 2019, acquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income include $5.6 million ($4.1 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share. Charges are primarily related to the Bioquell and Anios acquisitions and consist of integration costs, advisory and legal fees. Acquisition and integration costs reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2019 include $7.6 million ($5.6 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share and are related to recognition of fair value step-up in the Bioquell inventory and facility closure costs. In conjunction with our acquisitions, we incurred $0.2 million ($0.1 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of special (gains) and charges reported in interest expense in 2019.\nDisposal and impairment charges\nDisposal and impairment charges reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income include $41.4 million ($41.5 million after tax) or $0.14 per diluted share in the 2020. During 2020, we recorded a $28.6 million ($28.6 million after tax) or $0.10 per diluted share impairment for a minority equity method investment due to the COVID-19 impact on the economic environment and the liquidity of the minority equity method investment. In addition, we recorded charges of $12.8 million ($12.9 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share related to the disposal of Holchem Group Limited ( Holchem\u201d) for the loss on sale and related transaction fees during 2020. Further information related to the disposal is included in Note 4.\nCOVID-19 activities\nCustomer demand for sanitizer products surged at the outset of COVID-19. We worked hard to meet the rapidly increasing demand and sold the vast majority of the sanitizer inventory. However, COVID-19 variant-related delays of customer's reopening and consumer activity resulted in a small portion of excess sanitizer inventory. We have recorded inventory reserves of $60 million during 2021 for excess sanitizer inventory and estimated disposal costs. During 2021 and 2020, we recorded charges of $36.8 million and $57.1 million, respectively, to protect the wages of certain employees directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We also recorded charges of $16.5 million and $2.4 million related to employee COVID-19 testing and related expenses during 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, we received subsidies and government assistance, which were recorded as a special (gain) of ($6.2) million and ($23.4) million during 2021 and 2020, respectively. COVID-19 pandemic charges are recorded in product and equipment cost of sales, service and lease cost of sales, and special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Total after tax net charges (gains) related to COVID-19 pandemic were $81.3 million or $0.28 per diluted share and $27.4 million or $0.09 per diluted share during 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOther operating activities\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded special charges of $0.3 million ($0.2 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share, $24.4 million ($16.0 million after tax) or $0.06 per diluted share and $10.5 million ($7.1 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share, respectively, recorded in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income primarily related to a Healthcare product recall in Europe.\nOther special charges of $18.4 million ($14.1 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share in 2021, $34.7 million ($33.9 million after tax) or $0.12 per diluted share recorded in 2020 and $21.4 million ($16.2 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share recorded in 2019 relate primarily to a specific legal reserve and related legal charges, partially offset by a litigation settlement in 2019, which are recorded in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income. We also recorded during 2020 a $7.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share, special charge related to the separation of ChampionX as a tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nOther (income) expense\nDuring 2021, we incurred settlement expense recorded in other (income) expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income of $37.2 million ($28.7 million after tax), or $0.10 per diluted share related to U.S. pension plan lump-sum payments to retirees.\nDuring 2020 and 2019, we recorded other expense of $0.4 million ($0.3 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share and $9.5 million ($7.2 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share, respectively, related to pension curtailments and settlements for ChampionX separation and Accelerate 2020. These charges have been included as a component of other (income) expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nInterest expense, net\nDuring 2021 and 2020, we recorded special charges of $32.3 million ($28.4 million after tax) or $0.10 per diluted share and $83.1 million ($64.0 million after tax) or $0.22 per diluted share, respectively, in interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income related to debt refinancing charges.

Operating income margin is defined as operating income divided by sales.\nOur reported operating income increased 15% when comparing 2021 to 2020 primarily driven by increased pricing and higher volume which more than offset significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints, including the impact of the Texas Freeze and Hurricane Ida and higher variable compensation compared to last year. Our reported operating income decreased 24% when comparing 2020 to 2019 primarily due to the overall negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on results, which yielded lower sales and reduced operating leverage, unfavorable business mix, more than offsetting cost savings, favorable pricing and higher variable compensation. Our reported operating income for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was impacted by special (gains) and charges. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the impacts of the Purolite transaction, 2021 adjusted operating income increased 11% when compared to 2020 adjusted operating income and 2020 adjusted operating income decreased 19% when compared to 2019 adjusted operating income.\nOther (Income) Expense\nTable 83: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reported GAAP other (income) expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($33.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($55.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($77.0)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special (gains) and charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP adjusted other (income) expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($71.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($56.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($86.5)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur reported other income was $33.9 million, $55.9 million and $77.0 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The change in our tax rate includes the tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items, which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates, as amounts included in our special (gains) and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our tax rate, and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods. The tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future.\nWe recognized net tax expense of $5.8 million related to discrete tax items during 2021. This included a non-cash deferred tax expense of $25.1 million associated with transferring certain intangible property between affiliates. Share-based compensation excess tax benefit was $29.1 million. The amount of this tax benefit is subject to variation in stock price and award exercises. The remaining discrete tax expense of $9.8 million was primarily related to the filing of federal, state, and foreign tax returns and other income tax adjustments including the impact of changes in tax law, audit settlements and other changes in estimates.\nWe recognized a total net benefit related to discrete tax items of $55.8 million during 2020. The tax benefit related to share-based compensation excess tax benefit contributed $57.3 million. We recorded changes in reserves in non-U.S. and U.S. jurisdictions due to audit settlements and expiration of statutes of limitations which resulted in a $9.8 million tax benefit. Additionally, we recognized a net tax expense of $11.3 million primarily related to the filing of the prior year federal, state and foreign tax returns and other income tax adjustments.\nWe recognized total net benefit related to discrete tax items of $57.7 million during 2019. Share-based compensation excess tax benefit contributed $42.3 million in 2019. We recognized $15.6 million tax benefit related to changes in local tax law, which primarily includes $30.4 million benefit due to the passage of the Swiss Tax Reform and AHV Financing Act, a Swiss federal tax law, offset by a tax expense of $10.2 million due to the release of the final Treasury Regulation governing taxation of foreign dividends. We recorded changes in reserves in non-U.S. and U.S. jurisdictions due to audit settlements and statutes of limitations which resulted in a $13.8 million tax benefit. We finalized the 2015 and 2016 IRS audit, which also resulted in discrete tax expense of $11.0 million. The remaining discrete tax expense was primarily related to changes in estimates in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nThe change in our adjusted tax rates from 2019 to 2021 was primarily driven by global tax planning projects and geographic income mix. Future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors, including but not limited to other changes in global tax rules, further tax planning projects and geographic income

The difference between the fixed currency exchange rates and the actual currency exchange rates is reported as effect of foreign currency translation\u201d in the following tables. All other accounting policies of the reportable segments are consistent with U.S. GAAP and the accounting policies described in Note 2. Additional information about our reportable segments is included in Note 19.\nFixed currency net sales and operating income for 2021, 2020 and 2019 for our reportable segments are shown in the

Water, led by recovering market conditions, strong pricing and new business wins, along with a good growth in Food & Beverage, were offset by a decrease in Downstream sales growth. The 2020 sales decrease was impacted by regional declines in North America and Asia Pacific, partially offset by growth in all other regions.\nAt an operating segment level, Water fixed currency sales increased 6% in 2021 as strong new business wins and accelerating pricing leveraged recovering markets. Water fixed currency sales decreased 2% in 2020. Light industry water treatment sales had solid growth in 2021 and modest growth in 2020 led by good gains in food & beverage, light manufacturing and data centers. Heavy industry sales recorded a strong increase in 2021 driven by primary metals and were moderately lower in 2020, impacted by lower end market demand. Food & Beverage fixed currency sales increased 3% (2% acquisition adjusted) in 2021 primarily reflecting accelerating pricing, recovering markets and new business wins. Globally, we realized strong growth in beverage, brewing and modest growth in dairy. Fixed currency sales increased 5% (3% acquisition adjusted) in 2020, as share gains and pricing more than offset generally flat industry trends. Downstream fixed currency sales decreased 3% and 8% in 2021 and 2020, respectively, due to lower demand from COVID and impacts from the Texas freeze and Hurricane Ida impacts in 2021, while substantial reductions in transportation fuel demand and additive use hurt 2020 results. Paper fixed currency sales increased 11% in 2021 driven by increased pricing, strong new business wins, and increased ecommerce activity. Fixed currency sales were flat in 2020 despite softer industrial containerboard market conditions which reduced volumes in major regions.\nOperating Income\nFixed currency operating income and fixed currency operating income margins for Global Industrial decreased in 2021 and increased in 2020 when compared to prior periods.\nAcquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins decreased 2.1 percentage points in 2021 compared to 2020, as the 1.8 percentage point positive impact from accelerating pricing was more than offset by the 3.4 percentage point negative impact of significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints, including the impact of Texas Freeze and Hurricane Ida. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins increased in 2020, as the favorable impacts of cost savings, pricing, lower delivered product costs and lower variable compensation more than offset the negative impact of lower volume.\nGlobal Institutional & Specialty\nTable 92: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Sales\nFixed currency sales for Global Institutional & Specialty increased in 2021 driven by strong growth in the Institutional operating segment reflecting recovering markets, new business wins including gains from the Ecolab Science Certified programs, innovation and accelerating pricing and decreased in 2020 driven by a significant decline in the Institutional business due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAt an operating segment level, Institutional fixed currency sales increased 15% in 2021, driven by strong growth in the Institutional operating segment reflecting recovering markets in the U.S. and Europe, new business wins including gains from the Ecolab Science Certified programs, innovation and accelerating pricing. Fixed currency sales decreased 27% in 2020, reflecting strong hand and surface hygiene sales that were more than offset by the negative effects of mandated reductions for in-unit dining and domestic and international travel that significantly reduced foot traffic at full-service restaurants, occupancy rates at hotels and customer visits to other entertainment facilities through the year. Specialty fixed currency sales decreased 3% in 2021, as modest quickservice sales growth were more than offset by lower food retail sales. Quickservice sales showed a modest gain as new business wins more than offset impacts of COVID-19 restrictions and labor shortages. Food retail sales declined versus the strong sanitizer demand in 2020 and customer labor shortages that has resulted in reduced in-store services and associated product usage. Fixed currency sales increased 8% (5% acquisition adjusted) in 2020, as strong food retail sales growth, benefiting from continued expanded cleaning protocols and frequency in the grocery stores in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and new customer additions, was partially offset by moderately lower quickservice sales, which saw strong hand and surface sanitizer sales more than offset by COVID-19 pandemic related impacts on restaurant volumes.\nOperating Income\nFixed currency operating income for our Global Institutional & Specialty segment increased in 2021 and decreased in 2020 when compared to prior periods. Fixed currency operating income margins increased in 2021 after decreasing in 2020.\nAcquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins increased 5.2 percentage points during 2021, as the 6.9 percentage point positive impact from higher volume, accelerating pricing, and favorable mix more than offset the 2.4 percentage point negative impact of the comparison to lower variable compensation last year and higher delivered product costs. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins decreased during 2020 as margins were negatively impacted from volume declines, unfavorable mix and higher bad debt expense, which more than offset the positive impact of cost savings.\nGlobal Healthcare & Life Sciences\nTable 93: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

related demand and increased in 2020 as growth was driven by volume and pricing gains.\nAt an operating segment level, Healthcare fixed currency sales decreased 5% (8% acquisition adjusted) in 2021 reflecting the comparison against strong 2020 COVID-19 related hand and surface disinfection sales as well as softer elective surgical procedures activity in 2021 due to the rise in COVID variants during the year. Fixed currency sales increased 18% (16% acquisition adjusted) in 2020. Strong COVID-19 pandemic related hand and surface disinfection sales growth more than offset the unfavorable effects of delayed elective surgical procedures. Life Sciences fixed currency sales decreased 5% (4% acquisition adjusted) in 2021 as accelerating pricing was more than offset by volume declines versus the very strong 2020 driven by extraordinary COVID-19 demand last year. Fixed currency sales increased 35% in 2020, led by strong demand for biodecontamination units, business wins and pricing in our cleaning and disinfection programs for both the pharmaceutical and personal care markets, with strong growth in Europe and moderate North America gains.\nOperating Income\nFixed currency operating income for our Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment decreased in 2021 and increased in 2020 when compared to prior periods. Fixed currency operating income margins decreased in 2021 and increased in 2020.\nAcquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins decreased 2.7 percentage points in 2021, as the 1.8 percentage point positive impact from accelerating pricing was more than offset by the 3.5 percentage point negative impact of volume declines due to strong comparison against last year. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins increased in 2020 driven by strong volume gains, reduced discretionary spending and pricing, partially offset by negative impact of higher delivered product costs.\nOther\nTable 94: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

We continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $360 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $181 million was held outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1,260 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $59 million was held outside of the U.S. We will continue to evaluate our cash position in light of future developments.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had a $2.0 billion multi-year credit facility, which expires in April 2026. The credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks and supports our U.S. and Euro commercial paper programs. The maximum aggregate amount of commercial paper that may be issued under our U.S. commercial paper program and our Euro commercial paper program may not exceed $2.0 billion. At year end, we had $400 million outstanding commercial paper under our U.S. program and no commercial paper outstanding on our Euro program. There were no borrowings under our credit facility as of December 31, 2021 or 2020. As of December 31, 2021, both programs were rated A-2 by Standard & Poor's, P-2 by Moody's and by Fitch.\nWe had a $305 million term credit agreement which we drew on and repaid $303 million during the second quarter of 2020. The credit agreement expired in June 2020.\nAdditionally, we have uncommitted credit lines with major international banks and financial institutions. These credit lines support our daily global funding needs, primarily our global cash pooling structures. We have $118 million of bank supported letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees outstanding in support of our commercial business transactions. We do not have any other significant unconditional purchase obligations or commercial commitments.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Standard & Poor's and Fitch both rated our long-term credit at A- (stable outlook) and Moody's rated our long-term credit at A3 (stable outlook). A reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or negotiate new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities.\nWe are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures.\nA schedule of our various obligations as of December 31, 2021 are summarized in the following table:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ 8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ 8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One-time transition tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ 12,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ 382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ 1,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ 1,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ 8,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>*\n</td> <td>Interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at year end 2021.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2021, our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $25 million.

Therefore, these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.\nWe do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2021. We are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. We estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate $49 million in 2022. These amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.\nWe lease certain sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longer-term operating leases. Vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration. Vehicle leases have residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles.\nMarket Risk\nWe enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing monitoring and reporting, and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows.\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements, and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of \u20ac1,150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges.\nWe enter into cross-currency swap derivative contracts to hedge certain Euro denominated exposures from our investments in certain of its Euro denominated functional currency subsidiaries. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had \u20ac425 million of cross-currency swap derivative contracts outstanding designated as a net investment hedge.\nWe manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements. Under these arrangements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. As of December 31, 2021, we had $1,250 million of interest rate swaps outstanding.\nRefer to Note 9 for further information on our hedging activity.\nBased on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10% change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increase/decrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately $278 million. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.\nGLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT\nCOVID-19\nIn March 2020, the COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to affect major economic and financial markets and industries are facing the challenges with the economic conditions resulting from efforts to address the pandemic, including supply shortages, inflation and other challenges, such as those resulting from the introduction of vaccination mandates. While many government restrictions in the U.S. have eased throughout 2021, restrictions on activities continue in many other regions, particularly those where vaccination rates lag, continuing to impact consumer activity in those regions. Concerns remain that our markets could see a resurgence of cases triggering additional government mandated lockdowns or similar restrictions on activity, for example due to the emergence of a variant against which existing vaccines are not as effective or which may be more easily transmitted, particularly to those unvaccinated. These conditions have had and will continue to have a negative impact on market conditions and customer demand throughout the world.\nWe expect continued, if uneven, global economic recovery. We have also experienced continued substantial delivered product cost inflation. While we expect the challenges that affected us and the rest of the world in the fourth quarter to continue into the first quarter of 2022, assuming the rate of cost inflation and COVID impacts ease progressively in the second half of the year, we believe our continued actions should help us deliver improved results in 2022.\nGlobal Economies\nApproximately half of our sales are outside of the U.S. Our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results.\nArgentina has continued to experience negative economic trends, evidenced by multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the Argentine Peso, and increasing borrowing rates. Argentina is classified as a highly inflationary economy in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Argentina. During 2021, sales in Argentina represented less than 1% of our consolidated sales. Assets held in Argentina at the end of 2021 represented less than 1% of our consolidated assets.\nIn February 2022, the U.S. and the European Union responded to Russia's invasion of Ukraine by imposing various economic sanctions. The U.S. and other countries could impose wider sanctions or take further actions if the conflict escalates. While it is difficult to anticipate the impact the sanctions may have on Ecolab, any further sanctions imposed or actions taken by the U.S. or other countries, or any retaliatory measures by Russia in response, could increase our costs, reduce our sales and earnings or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations. During 2021, net sales to Russia and Ukraine were approximately 1% of consolidated net sales.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThis MD&A includes financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include:\n\u25cf Fixed currency sales\n\u25cf Adjusted net sales\n\u25cf Adjusted fixed currency sales\n\u25cf Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales\n\u25cf Adjusted cost of sales\n\u25cf Adjusted gross margin\n\u25cf Fixed currency operating income\n\u25cf Fixed currency operating income margin\n\u25cf Adjusted operating income\n\u25cf Adjusted operating income margin\n\u25cf Adjusted fixed currency operating income\n\u25cf Adjusted fixed currency operating income margin\n\u25cf Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income\n\u25cf Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin\n\u25cf Adjusted other (income) expense\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Adjusted interest expense, net </td> </tr>\n</table> \u25cf EBITDA\n\u25cf Adjusted tax rate\n\u25cf Adjusted net income from discontinued operations, net of tax\n\u25cf Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Ecolab\n\u25cf Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations\nWe provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.\nOur non-GAAP adjusted financial measure for net sales excludes Purolite sales. Our non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for cost of sales, gross margin, operating income, other (income) expense and interest expense exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges and (with the exception of other (income) expense) the impact of the Purolite transaction, and our non-GAAP measures for tax rate, net income from continuing operations attributable to Ecolab and diluted EPS from continuing operations further exclude the impact of discrete tax items. We include items within special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items that we believe can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results. After tax special (gains) and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pre-tax special (gains) and charges.\nEBITDA is defined as the sum of net income including non-controlling interest, provision for income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is used in our net debt to EBITDA ratio, which we view as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization.\nWe evaluate the performance of our international operations based on fixed currency rates of foreign exchange. Fixed currency amounts included in this Form 10-K are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed foreign currency exchange rates established by management at the beginning of 2021. We also provide our segment results based on public currency rates for international purposes.\nOur reportable segments do not include the impact of intangible asset amortization from the Nalco merger or the impact of special (gains) and charges as these are not allocated to the Company's reportable segments.\nAcquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture and the Venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods. In addition, as part of the separation, we also entered into a Master Cross Supply and Product Transfer agreement with ChampionX to provide, receive or transfer certain products for a period up to 36 months. Sales of product to ChampionX under this agreement are recorded in product and equipment sales in the Corporate segment along with the related cost of sales. These transactions are removed from the consolidated results as part of the calculation of the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures included in this MD&A and we have provided reconciliations of reported U.S. GAAP amounts to the non-GAAP amounts.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following management discussion and analysis ( MD&A\u201d) provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. We provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level. We also provide quantitative information regarding special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. Such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature. Qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance.\nThe discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This discussion contains various Non-GAAP Financial Measures and also contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d at the end of this MD&A, and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d within Items 1 and 1A of this Form 10-K. We also refer readers to the tables within the section entitled Results of Operations\u201d of this MD&A for reconciliation information of Non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP.\nComparability of Results\nPurolite acquisition\nOn December 1, 2021, we acquired Purolite for total consideration of $3.7 billion in cash. Purolite is a leading and fast-growing global provider of high-end ion exchange resins for the separation and purification of solutions for pharmaceutical and industrial applications. Headquartered in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, Purolite operates in more than 30 countries. Purolite is reported within our Life Sciences operating segment. Acquisition and integration charges are recorded within special (gains) and charges.\nIn addition, the remaining impacts of the Purolite acquisition including operating results, acquisition-related amortization and interest expense related to the transaction have also been excluded from adjusted results.\nChampionX Transaction\nOn June 3, 2020, we completed the previously announced separation of our Upstream Energy business (the ChampionX business\u201d) in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the Transaction\u201d) through the split-off of ChampionX Holding Inc. ( ChampionX\u201d), formed by Ecolab as a wholly owned subsidiary to hold the ChampionX Business, followed immediately by the merger of ChampionX (the Merger\u201d) with a wholly owned subsidiary of ChampionX Corporation (f/k/a Apergy Corporation, Apergy\u201d).\nThe ChampionX business met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations because the separation of ChampionX was a strategic shift in business that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, we report the historical results of ChampionX, including the results of operations, cash flows, and related assets and liabilities, as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein. Unless otherwise noted, the accompanying MD&A has been revised to reflect the ChampionX business as discontinued operations and prior year balances have been revised accordingly to reflect continuing operations only.\nComparability of Reportable Segments\nEffective in the first quarter of 2020, and in anticipation of the separation of the Upstream Energy business, we created the Upstream and Downstream operating segments from the Global Energy operating segment, which was also a reportable segment. Subsequent to the separation of ChampionX, we no longer report the Upstream Energy segment, which previously held the ChampionX business.\nThe Downstream operating segment has been aggregated into the Global Industrial reportable segment. Also, in the first quarter of 2020, we announced leadership changes which allow for shared oversight and focus on the Healthcare and Life Sciences operating segments and established the Global Healthcare & Life Sciences reportable segment. This segment is comprised of the Healthcare operating segment which was previously aggregated in the Global Institutional reportable segment and the Life Sciences operating segment which was previously aggregated in the Global Industrial reportable segment. Additionally, the Textile Care operating segment, which is now being reported in Other, had previously been aggregated in the Global Industrial reportable segment. We also renamed the Global Institutional reportable segment to the Global Institutional & Specialty reportable segment. We made other immaterial changes, including the movement of certain customers and cost allocations between reportable segments.\nImpact of Acquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture and the Venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods. As part of the separation, we also entered into a Master Cross Supply and Product Transfer agreement with ChampionX to provide, receive or transfer certain products for a period up to 36 months. Sales of product to ChampionX under this agreement are recorded in product and equipment sales in the Corporate segment along with the related cost of sales. These transactions are removed from the consolidated results as part of the calculation of the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.\nFixed Currency Foreign Exchange Rates\nManagement evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations. Fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into U.S. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. Public currency rate data provided within the Segment Performance\u201d section of this MD&A reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period and is provided for informational purposes only.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nIn 2021, we delivered strong sales performance in an environment where COVID-19 infections impacted business activity and further disrupted global supply chains which together, impacted the global recovery. Delivered product cost inflation and other supply constraints increased significantly but we undertook extraordinary measures to assure our customers were supplied with our critical products and services. Double-digit sales growth in the Institutional & Specialty and Other segments along with strong Industrial segment growth more than offset the Healthcare & Life Sciences segment's decline versus a very strong gain last year. Accelerating pricing and higher volume more than offset significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints, including the impact of Texas Freeze and Hurricane Ida, and the comparison to lower variable compensation last year.\nSales\nReported sales increased 8% to $12.7 billion in 2021 from $11.8 billion in 2020. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales increased 6% compared to the prior year. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increased 5% compared to the prior year.\nGross Margin\nOur reported gross margin was 40.2% of sales for 2021, compared to our 2020 reported gross margin of 41.4%. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and impacts from the Purolite transaction included in cost of sales from both 2021 and 2020, our adjusted gross margin was 40.9% in 2021 and 41.8% in 2020.\nOperating Income\nReported operating income increased 15% to $1.6 billion in 2021, compared to $1.4 billion in 2020. Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the impacts of the Purolite transaction, increased 11% in 2021. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 8% in 2021.\nEarnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Ecolab Per Common Share ( EPS\u201d)\nReported continuing operations diluted EPS increased 17% to $3.91 in 2021 compared to $3.33 in 2020. Special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years. Special (gains) and charges in 2021 include COVID-19 related charges, restructuring charges, debt refinancing charges, acquisition and integration charges, and litigation and other charges. Special (gains) and charges in 2020 include debt refinancing charges, restructuring charges, disposal and impairment charges, Healthcare product recall charges, acquisition and integration charges, COVID-19 related charges, and litigation and other charges. Special (gains) and charges in 2019 were driven primarily by the impact of restructuring charges, discrete tax items, acquisition and integration charges and litigation and other charges. The impact of the Purolite transaction was $0.02 per share dilutive to reported earnings per share from continuing operations (excluding special charges) as sales since its December 1, 2021 acquisition were more than offset by acquisition-related amortization and interest expense. Adjusted continuing operations diluted EPS, which exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, the impacts of the Purolite transaction and discrete tax items increased 17% to $4.69 in 2021 compared to $4.02 in 2020.\nBalance Sheet\nWe remain committed to maintaining A\u201d range ratings metrics over the long-term, supported by our current credit ratings of A-/A3/A- by Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investor Services and Fitch, respectively. Our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates.\nNet Debt to EBITDA\nOur net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) was 3.4 and 2.4 for 2021 and 2020, respectively. We view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. See the Net Debt to EBITDA\u201d table on page 44 for reconciliation information.\nCash Flow\nCash flow from continuing operations operating activities was $2.1 billion in 2021 compared to $1.7 billion in 2020. We continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, investments in our business, acquisitions, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments.\nDividends\nWe increased our quarterly cash dividend 6% in December 2021, bringing annual dividends declared to $1.95 per share. The increase represents our 30th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 85th consecutive year we have paid cash dividends. Our outstanding dividend history reflects our long term growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ( Notes\u201d).\nPreparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. As the impact of the pandemic continues to evolve, estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require judgment. These estimates and assumptions may change in future periods and will be recognized in the consolidated financial\ninformation as new events occur and additional information becomes known. To the extent actual results differ materially from those estimates and assumptions, our future financial statements could be affected.\nBesides estimates that meet the critical\u201d estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even from estimates not deemed critical. Our critical accounting estimates include the following:\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing service. Revenue from product and sold equipment is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of the product or delivery of the equipment. Revenue from service and leased equipment is recognized when the services are provided, or the customer receives the benefit from the leased equipment, which is over time. Service revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method and aligns with when the services are provided. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date because the effort provided by the field selling and service organization represents services provided, which corresponds with the transfer of control. Revenue for leased equipment is accounted for under Topic 842 Leases and recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease contract.\nOur revenue policies do not provide for general rights of return. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives based primarily on historical experience and anticipated performance over the contract period. Depending on market conditions, we may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive. We also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits based on specific circumstances and credit conditions. We record an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on our estimates of expected future credit losses.\nThe revenue standard can be applied to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics if it is reasonable that the effects of applying the standard at the portfolio would not be significantly different than applying the standard at the individual contract level. We apply the portfolio approach primarily within each operating segment by geographical region. Application of the portfolio approach was focused on those characteristics that have the most significant accounting consequences in terms of their effect on the timing of revenue recognition or the amount of revenue recognized. We determined the key criteria to assess with respect to the portfolio approach, including the related deliverables, the characteristics of the customers and the timing and transfer of goods and services, which most closely aligned within the operating segments. In addition, the accountability for the business operations, as well as the operational decisions on how to go to market and the product offerings, are performed at the operating segment level. For additional information on revenue recognition, refer to Note 18.\nLitigation and Environmental Liabilities\nOur business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. Some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations.\nWe record liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs. We record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses. Expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain. While the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals, and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position. For additional information on our commitments and contingencies, refer to Note 16.\nActuarially Determined Liabilities\nPension and Postretirement Healthcare Benefit Plans\nThe measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries. These assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses.\nThe significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate, expected return on assets, projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table.\n \u25cf The discount rate assumptions for our U.S. plans are assessed using a yield curve constructed from a subset of bonds yielding greater than the median return from a population of non-callable, corporate bond issues that have an average rating of AA when averaging available Moody's Investor Services, Standard & Poor's and Fitch ratings. The discount rate is calculated by matching the plans' projected cash flows to the bond yield curve. For 2021 and 2020, we measured service and interest costs by applying the \n specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows. We believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans' liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. In determining our U.S. pension obligations for 2021, our weighted-average discount rate increased to 2.86% from 2.48% at year-end 2020. In determining our U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2021, our weighted-average discount rate increased to 2.75% from 2.37% at year-end 2020. \n \u25cf The expected rate of return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategies and views of investment advisors, and represents our expected long-term return on plan assets. Our weighted-average expected return on U.S. plan assets used in determining the U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care expenses was 7.00% for 2021, 7.25% for 2020 and 7.25% for 2019. \n \u25cf Projected salary and health care cost increases are based on our long-term actual experience, the near-term outlook and assumed inflation. Our weighted-average projected salary increase used in determining the U.S. pension expenses was 4.03% for 2021, 2020 and 2019. \n \u25cf For postretirement benefit measurement purposes as of December 31, 2021, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed to be 6.75% for pre-65 costs and 7.25% for post-65 costs. The rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 4.5% in 2029 and remain at those levels thereafter. \n \u25cf In determining our U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2021, we utilized the most recent mortality table, MP-2021 projection scale (applied to the Pri-2012 mortality table). \nThe effects of actual results differing from our assumptions, as well as changes in assumptions, are reflected in the unrecognized actuarial loss and amortized over future periods and, therefore, will generally affect our recognized expense in future periods. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations and expense. The unrecognized net actuarial loss on our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans decreased to $397 million as of December 31, 2021 from $691 million as of December 31, 2020 (both before tax), primarily due to current year net actuarial gains.\nThe effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of December 31, 2021, on the December 31, 2021 defined benefit obligation and 2022 expense is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant U.S. plans. Expense amounts reflect the accounting for actuarial gains as a component of other comprehensive income and recognition of the impacts into income over the remaining service period:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect on U.S. Pension Plans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Higher\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Recorded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-0.25 pts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $65.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-0.25 pts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect on U.S. Postretirement\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Health Care Benefits Plans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Higher\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Recorded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-0.25 pts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-0.25 pts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans, with the majority of the amounts held in the U.K. and Eurozone countries. We use assumptions similar to our U.S. plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations, however, the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information.\nRefer to Note 17 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations.\nSelf-Insurance\nGlobally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses. We are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles, subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. We are self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. We determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis.\nIncome Taxes\nJudgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions.\nEffective Income Tax Rate\nOur effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions. We recognize the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances.\nTax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. As a result, the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities and Valuation Allowances\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of available evidence, both positive and negative, we recognize tax assets, such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not. Relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results, sources of future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nA number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter, for which we have established a liability for uncertain tax position, is audited and finally resolved. The number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) has completed examinations of our U.S. federal income tax returns through 2016 and the years 2017 and 2018 are currently under audit. In addition to the U.S. federal examinations, we have ongoing audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.\nThe tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal, state and international jurisdictions. We believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations, and our liabilities for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken. Because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations, we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits (including related interest and penalties) for amounts that do not meet the more-likely-than-not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance. The liability for uncertain tax positions is reviewed throughout the year, taking into account new legislation, regulations, case law and audit results. Settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments or receipts and/or adjustments to tax expense. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets within other non-current liabilities. Our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $25 million and $21 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For additional information on income taxes refer to Note 13.\nLong-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nLong-Lived and Amortizable Intangible Assets\nLong-lived and amortizable intangible assets acquired are recorded on the acquisition date at their respective fair values based on the fair value requirements defined in U.S. GAAP. This requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions relating to the present value of its future cash flows, such as growth rates, royalty rates or discount rates.\nWe review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $6.8 billion and $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for impairment when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the manner in which asset or asset groups are being used or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset or asset group. Impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset's or assets group's carrying amount over its estimated fair value.\nWe use the straight-line method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets, including our customer relationships. We consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships, including projected sales data, customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships.\nGlobally, we have a broad customer base. Our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions, including the customer bases acquired from our Nalco, Anios, CID Lines and Purolite transactions, which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships. Our historical retention rate, coupled with our consistent track record of keeping long-term relationships with our customers, supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer bases. If our customer retention rates or other post-acquisition operational activities change materially, we would evaluate the financial impact and significances of the events given rise to the change which could result in impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets, or absent an impairment, an acceleration of amortization.\nIn addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. Changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. We have experienced no significant changes in the carrying amount or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets.\nGoodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets\nWe had total goodwill of $8.1 billion and $6.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter. Our reporting units are aligned with our eleven operating segments.\nFor our annual 2021 goodwill impairment assessment, we completed a quantitative impairment assessment for each of our eleven reporting units using discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated assumptions, including future operating performance, long-term growth, and discount rates. Our goodwill impairment assessments for 2021 indicated the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying amounts of the respective reporting units by a significant margin. We assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may be higher than its fair value. Additionally, no events noted during the second half of 2021 indicated a need to update any of our analyses or conclusions reached in the second quarter of 2021 for any of our eleven reporting units. There has been no impairment of goodwill in any of the periods presented.\nThe Nalco trade name is our only indefinite life intangible asset. During the second quarter of 2021, we completed our annual impairment assessment of the Nalco trade name using the relief from royalty discounted cash flow method, which incorporates assumptions, including future sales projections, royalty rates and discount rates. Our Nalco tradename impairment assessment for 2021 indicated the estimated fair value of the Nalco trade name exceeded its $1.2 billion carrying amount by a significant margin. There has been no impairment of the Nalco trade name intangible since it was acquired.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\nTable 77: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Our 2021, 2020 and 2019 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special (gains) and charges of $93.9 million, $48.2 million, and $38.5 million, respectively. Special (gains) and charges items impacting COS are shown within the Special (Gains) and Charges\u201d table below.\nExcluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the impacts of the Purolite transaction, our 2021 adjusted gross margin was 40.9% compared against a 2020 adjusted gross margin of 41.8%. The decrease primarily reflected increased pricing and higher volumes which were more than offset by significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints, including the impact of the Texas Freeze and Hurricane Ida.\nExcluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our adjusted gross margin was 41.8% and 44.2% for 2020 and 2019, respectively.

which is consistent with our internal management reporting.\nRestructuring Activities\nRestructuring activities are primarily related to the Institutional Advancement Program and Accelerate 2020, both of which are described below. These activities have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges, and other (income) expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFurther details related to our restructuring charges are included in Note 3.\nInstitutional Advancement Program\nWe approved a restructuring plan in 2020 focused on the Institutional business ( the Institutional Plan\u201d) which is intended to enhance our Institutional sales and service structure and allow the sales team to capture share and penetration while maximizing service effectiveness by leveraging our ongoing investments in digital technology. In February 2021, we expanded the Institutional Plan, and expect that these restructuring charges will be completed by 2023, with total anticipated costs of $65 million ($50 million after tax) or $0.17 per diluted share. The costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance and facility closures. We also anticipate non-cash charges related to equipment disposals. Actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken.\nIn 2021, we recorded total restructuring charges of $12.6 million ($10.2 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share, primarily related to severance, disposals of equipment and office closures. We have recorded $47.8 million ($36.6 million after tax), or $0.13 per diluted share of cumulative restructuring charges under the Institutional Plan. The liability related to the Institutional Plan was $5.1 million as of December 31, 2021. The majority of the pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters which continue to be funded from operating activities.\nThe Institutional Plan has delivered $41 million of cumulative cost savings with estimated annual cost savings of $50 million in continuing operations by 2024.\nAccelerate 2020\nDuring 2018, we formally commenced a restructuring plan Accelerate 2020 ( the Plan\u201d), to leverage technology and system investments and organizational changes. The goal of the Plan is to further simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidated facilities and focus on key long-term growth areas by further leveraging technology and structural improvements. During 2020, we expanded the Plan for additional costs and savings to further leverage the technology and structural improvements. Following the establishment of the separate Institutional Plan, we now expect that the restructuring activities will be completed by the end of 2022, with total anticipated costs of $255 million ($195 million after tax), or $0.67 per diluted share, over this period of time, when revised for continuing operations. Costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance costs and some facility closure costs relating to team reorganizations. Actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken.\nWe recorded restructuring charges of $5.3 million ($6.2 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share in 2021. The liability related to the Plan was $32.7 million as of the end of the year. We have recorded $244.5 million ($190.0 million after tax), or $0.66 per diluted share, of cumulative restructuring charges under the Plan. The majority of the pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters which continue to be funded from operating activities.\nThe Plan has delivered $300 million of cumulative cost savings with estimated annual cost savings of $315 million in continuing operations by 2022.\nOther Restructuring Activities\nDuring 2021, we incurred restructuring charges of $18.7 million ($17.0 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share, related to other immaterial restructuring activity. The charges primarily related to severance and asset write-offs.\nDuring 2020, we incurred restructuring charges of $1.8 million ($1.2 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, related to other immaterial restructuring plan. The charges are comprised of severance, facility closure costs, including asset disposals, and consulting fees.\nDuring 2019, net restructuring gains related to restructuring plans entered into prior to 2019 were $1.5 million ($1.1 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share.\nThe restructuring liability balance for all other restructuring plans excluding Accelerate 2020 and the Institutional Plan were $4.6 million and $5.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The reduction in liability was driven primarily by severance payments. The remaining liability is expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will continue to be funded from operating activities. Cash payments during 2021 related to all other restructuring plans excluding the Accelerate 2020 and Institutional Plan were $10.5 million.\nAcquisition and integration related costs\nAcquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2021 include $29.9 million ($23.5 million after tax) or $0.08 per diluted share. Charges are related to the Purolite Corporation ( Purolite\u201d), Copal Invest NV, including its primary operating entity CID Lines (collectively, CID Lines\u201d), and Bioquell PLC ( Bioquell\u201d) acquisitions and consist of integration costs and advisory and legal fees. Acquisition and integration costs reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2021 include $4.2 million ($3.3 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share and are related to the recognition of fair value step-up in the Purolite inventory. In conjunction with its acquisitions, we incurred $0.8 million ($0.6 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of special (gains) and charges reported in interest expense in 2021.\nDuring 2020, acquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income include $8.5 million ($6.9 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share. Charges are related to CID Lines, Bioquell and the Laboratoires Anios ( Anios\u201d) acquisitions and consist of integration costs and advisory and legal fees. Acquisition and integration costs reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2020 include $3.9 million ($3.2 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share and are related to the recognition of fair value step-up in the CID Lines inventory, severance and the closure of a facility. In conjunction with our acquisitions, we incurred $0.7 million ($0.6 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of special (gains) and charges reported in interest expense in 2020.\nDuring 2019, acquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income include $5.6 million ($4.1 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share. Charges are primarily related to the Bioquell and Anios acquisitions and consist of integration costs, advisory and legal fees. Acquisition and integration costs reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2019 include $7.6 million ($5.6 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share and are related to recognition of fair value step-up in the Bioquell inventory and facility closure costs. In conjunction with our acquisitions, we incurred $0.2 million ($0.1 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of special (gains) and charges reported in interest expense in 2019.\nDisposal and impairment charges\nDisposal and impairment charges reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income include $41.4 million ($41.5 million after tax) or $0.14 per diluted share in the 2020. During 2020, we recorded a $28.6 million ($28.6 million after tax) or $0.10 per diluted share impairment for a minority equity method investment due to the COVID-19 impact on the economic environment and the liquidity of the minority equity method investment. In addition, we recorded charges of $12.8 million ($12.9 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share related to the disposal of Holchem Group Limited ( Holchem\u201d) for the loss on sale and related transaction fees during 2020. Further information related to the disposal is included in Note 4.\nCOVID-19 activities\nCustomer demand for sanitizer products surged at the outset of COVID-19. We worked hard to meet the rapidly increasing demand and sold the vast majority of the sanitizer inventory. However, COVID-19 variant-related delays of customer's reopening and consumer activity resulted in a small portion of excess sanitizer inventory. We have recorded inventory reserves of $60 million during 2021 for excess sanitizer inventory and estimated disposal costs. During 2021 and 2020, we recorded charges of $36.8 million and $57.1 million, respectively, to protect the wages of certain employees directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We also recorded charges of $16.5 million and $2.4 million related to employee COVID-19 testing and related expenses during 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, we received subsidies and government assistance, which were recorded as a special (gain) of ($6.2) million and ($23.4) million during 2021 and 2020, respectively. COVID-19 pandemic charges are recorded in product and equipment cost of sales, service and lease cost of sales, and special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Total after tax net charges (gains) related to COVID-19 pandemic were $81.3 million or $0.28 per diluted share and $27.4 million or $0.09 per diluted share during 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOther operating activities\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded special charges of $0.3 million ($0.2 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share, $24.4 million ($16.0 million after tax) or $0.06 per diluted share and $10.5 million ($7.1 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share, respectively, recorded in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income primarily related to a Healthcare product recall in Europe.\nOther special charges of $18.4 million ($14.1 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share in 2021, $34.7 million ($33.9 million after tax) or $0.12 per diluted share recorded in 2020 and $21.4 million ($16.2 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share recorded in 2019 relate primarily to a specific legal reserve and related legal charges, partially offset by a litigation settlement in 2019, which are recorded in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income. We also recorded during 2020 a $7.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share, special charge related to the separation of ChampionX as a tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nOther (income) expense\nDuring 2021, we incurred settlement expense recorded in other (income) expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income of $37.2 million ($28.7 million after tax), or $0.10 per diluted share related to U.S. pension plan lump-sum payments to retirees.\nDuring 2020 and 2019, we recorded other expense of $0.4 million ($0.3 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share and $9.5 million ($7.2 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share, respectively, related to pension curtailments and settlements for ChampionX separation and Accelerate 2020. These charges have been included as a component of other (income) expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nInterest expense, net\nDuring 2021 and 2020, we recorded special charges of $32.3 million ($28.4 million after tax) or $0.10 per diluted share and $83.1 million ($64.0 million after tax) or $0.22 per diluted share, respectively, in interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income related to debt refinancing charges. In addition, during 2021, 2020 and 2019, an immaterial amount of interest expense was recorded due to acquisition and integration costs.\nOperating Income and Operating Income Margin\nTable 82: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reported GAAP operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $1,598.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $1,395.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $1,845.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special (gains) and charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 196.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 227.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 158.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of Purolite on operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP adjusted operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,798.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,623.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,003.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign currency translation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP adjusted fixed currency operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $1,817.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $1,676.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $2,041.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(percent)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reported GAAP operating income margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP adjusted operating income margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP adjusted fixed currency operating income margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating income and corresponding operating income margin are shown in the previous tables. Operating income margin is defined as operating income divided by sales.\nOur reported operating income increased 15% when comparing 2021 to 2020 primarily driven by increased pricing and higher volume which more than offset significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints, including the impact of the Texas Freeze and Hurricane Ida and higher variable compensation compared to last year. Our reported operating income decreased 24% when comparing 2020 to 2019 primarily due to the overall negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on results, which yielded lower sales and reduced operating leverage, unfavorable business mix, more than offsetting cost savings, favorable pricing and higher variable compensation. Our reported operating income for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was impacted by special (gains) and charges. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the impacts of the Purolite transaction, 2021 adjusted operating income increased 11% when compared to 2020 adjusted operating income and 2020 adjusted operating income decreased 19% when compared to 2019 adjusted operating income.\nOther (Income) Expense\nTable 83: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reported GAAP other (income) expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($33.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($55.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($77.0)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special (gains) and charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP adjusted other (income) expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($71.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($56.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($86.5)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur reported other income was $33.9 million, $55.9 million and $77.0 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The increase in our 2020 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2019 was driven primarily by higher outstanding debt.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table provides a summary of our tax rate:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(percent)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reported GAAP tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax rate impact of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special (gains) and charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discrete tax items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purolite tax impacts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP adjusted tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur reported tax rate was 19.1%, 15.2%, and 16.7%, for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change in our tax rate includes the tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items, which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates, as amounts included in our special (gains) and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our tax rate, and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods. The tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future.\nWe recognized net tax expense of $5.8 million related to discrete tax items during 2021. This included a non-cash deferred tax expense of $25.1 million associated with transferring certain intangible property between affiliates. Share-based compensation excess tax benefit was $29.1 million. The amount of this tax benefit is subject to variation in stock price and award exercises. The remaining discrete tax expense of $9.8 million was primarily related to the filing of federal, state, and foreign tax returns and other income tax adjustments including the impact of changes in tax law, audit settlements and other changes in estimates.\nWe recognized a total net benefit related to discrete tax items of $55.8 million during 2020. The tax benefit related to share-based compensation excess tax benefit contributed $57.3 million. We recorded changes in reserves in non-U.S. and U.S. jurisdictions due to audit settlements and expiration of statutes of limitations which resulted in a $9.8 million tax benefit. Additionally, we recognized a net tax expense of $11.3 million primarily related to the filing of the prior year federal, state and foreign tax returns and other income tax adjustments.\nWe recognized total net benefit related to discrete tax items of $57.7 million during 2019. Share-based compensation excess tax benefit contributed $42.3 million in 2019. We recognized $15.6 million tax benefit related to changes in local tax law, which primarily includes $30.4 million benefit due to the passage of the Swiss Tax Reform and AHV Financing Act, a Swiss federal tax law, offset by a tax expense of $10.2 million due to the release of the final Treasury Regulation governing taxation of foreign dividends. We recorded changes in reserves in non-U.S. and U.S. jurisdictions due to audit settlements and statutes of limitations which resulted in a $13.8 million tax benefit. We finalized the 2015 and 2016 IRS audit, which also resulted in discrete tax expense of $11.0 million. The remaining discrete tax expense was primarily related to changes in estimates in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nThe change in our adjusted tax rates from 2019 to 2021 was primarily driven by global tax planning projects and geographic income mix. Future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors, including but not limited to other changes in global tax rules, further tax planning projects and geographic income

Water, led by recovering market conditions, strong pricing and new business wins, along with a good growth in Food & Beverage, were offset by a decrease in Downstream sales growth. The 2020 sales decrease was impacted by regional declines in North America and Asia Pacific, partially offset by growth in all other regions.\nAt an operating segment level, Water fixed currency sales increased 6% in 2021 as strong new business wins and accelerating pricing leveraged recovering markets. Water fixed currency sales decreased 2% in 2020. Light industry water treatment sales had solid growth in 2021 and modest growth in 2020 led by good gains in food & beverage, light manufacturing and data centers. Heavy industry sales recorded a strong increase in 2021 driven by primary metals and were moderately lower in 2020, impacted by lower end market demand. Food & Beverage fixed currency sales increased 3% (2% acquisition adjusted) in 2021 primarily reflecting accelerating pricing, recovering markets and new business wins. Globally, we realized strong growth in beverage, brewing and modest growth in dairy. Fixed currency sales increased 5% (3% acquisition adjusted) in 2020, as share gains and pricing more than offset generally flat industry trends. Downstream fixed currency sales decreased 3% and 8% in 2021 and 2020, respectively, due to lower demand from COVID and impacts from the Texas freeze and Hurricane Ida impacts in 2021, while substantial reductions in transportation fuel demand and additive use hurt 2020 results. Paper fixed currency sales increased 11% in 2021 driven by increased pricing, strong new business wins, and increased ecommerce activity. Fixed currency sales were flat in 2020 despite softer industrial containerboard market conditions which reduced volumes in major regions.\nOperating Income\nFixed currency operating income and fixed currency operating income margins for Global Industrial decreased in 2021 and increased in 2020 when compared to prior periods.\nAcquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins decreased 2.1 percentage points in 2021 compared to 2020, as the 1.8 percentage point positive impact from accelerating pricing was more than offset by the 3.4 percentage point negative impact of significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints, including the impact of Texas Freeze and Hurricane Ida. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins increased in 2020, as the favorable impacts of cost savings, pricing, lower delivered product costs and lower variable compensation more than offset the negative impact of lower volume.\nGlobal Institutional & Specialty\nTable 92: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Sales\nFixed currency sales for Global Institutional & Specialty increased in 2021 driven by strong growth in the Institutional operating segment reflecting recovering markets, new business wins including gains from the Ecolab Science Certified programs, innovation and accelerating pricing and decreased in 2020 driven by a significant decline in the Institutional business due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAt an operating segment level, Institutional fixed currency sales increased 15% in 2021, driven by strong growth in the Institutional operating segment reflecting recovering markets in the U.S. and Europe, new business wins including gains from the Ecolab Science Certified programs, innovation and accelerating pricing. Fixed currency sales decreased 27% in 2020, reflecting strong hand and surface hygiene sales that were more than offset by the negative effects of mandated reductions for in-unit dining and domestic and international travel that significantly reduced foot traffic at full-service restaurants, occupancy rates at hotels and customer visits to other entertainment facilities through the year. Specialty fixed currency sales decreased 3% in 2021, as modest quickservice sales growth were more than offset by lower food retail sales. Quickservice sales showed a modest gain as new business wins more than offset impacts of COVID-19 restrictions and labor shortages. Food retail sales declined versus the strong sanitizer demand in 2020 and customer labor shortages that has resulted in reduced in-store services and associated product usage. Fixed currency sales increased 8% (5% acquisition adjusted) in 2020, as strong food retail sales growth, benefiting from continued expanded cleaning protocols and frequency in the grocery stores in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and new customer additions, was partially offset by moderately lower quickservice sales, which saw strong hand and surface sanitizer sales more than offset by COVID-19 pandemic related impacts on restaurant volumes.\nOperating Income\nFixed currency operating income for our Global Institutional & Specialty segment increased in 2021 and decreased in 2020 when compared to prior periods. Fixed currency operating income margins increased in 2021 after decreasing in 2020.\nAcquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins increased 5.2 percentage points during 2021, as the 6.9 percentage point positive impact from higher volume, accelerating pricing, and favorable mix more than offset the 2.4 percentage point negative impact of the comparison to lower variable compensation last year and higher delivered product costs. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins decreased during 2020 as margins were negatively impacted from volume declines, unfavorable mix and higher bad debt expense, which more than offset the positive impact of cost savings.\nGlobal Healthcare & Life Sciences\nTable 93: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

related demand and increased in 2020 as growth was driven by volume and pricing gains.\nAt an operating segment level, Healthcare fixed currency sales decreased 5% (8% acquisition adjusted) in 2021 reflecting the comparison against strong 2020 COVID-19 related hand and surface disinfection sales as well as softer elective surgical procedures activity in 2021 due to the rise in COVID variants during the year. Fixed currency sales increased 18% (16% acquisition adjusted) in 2020. Strong COVID-19 pandemic related hand and surface disinfection sales growth more than offset the unfavorable effects of delayed elective surgical procedures. Life Sciences fixed currency sales decreased 5% (4% acquisition adjusted) in 2021 as accelerating pricing was more than offset by volume declines versus the very strong 2020 driven by extraordinary COVID-19 demand last year. Fixed currency sales increased 35% in 2020, led by strong demand for biodecontamination units, business wins and pricing in our cleaning and disinfection programs for both the pharmaceutical and personal care markets, with strong growth in Europe and moderate North America gains.\nOperating Income\nFixed currency operating income for our Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment decreased in 2021 and increased in 2020 when compared to prior periods.

A reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or negotiate new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities.\nWe are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures.\nA schedule of our various obligations as of December 31, 2021 are summarized in the following table:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ 8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ 8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One-time transition tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ 12,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ 382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ 1,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ 1,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ 8,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n * Interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at year end 2021. \nAs of December 31, 2021, our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $25 million. We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required. Therefore, these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.\nWe do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2021. We are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. We estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate $49 million in 2022. These amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.\nWe lease certain sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longer-term operating leases. Vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration. Vehicle leases have residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles.\nMarket Risk\nWe enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing monitoring and reporting, and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows.\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements, and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of \u20ac1,150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges.\nWe enter into cross-currency swap derivative contracts to hedge certain Euro denominated exposures from our investments in certain of its Euro denominated functional currency subsidiaries. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had \u20ac425 million of cross-currency swap derivative contracts outstanding designated as a net investment hedge.\nWe manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements. Under these arrangements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. As of December 31, 2021, we had $1,250 million of interest rate swaps outstanding.\nRefer to Note 9 for further information on our hedging activity.\nBased on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10% change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increase/decrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately $278 million. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.\nGLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT\nCOVID-19\nIn March 2020, the COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to affect major economic and financial markets and industries are facing the challenges with the economic conditions resulting from efforts to address the pandemic, including supply shortages, inflation and other challenges, such as those resulting from the introduction of vaccination mandates. While many government restrictions in the U.S. have eased throughout 2021, restrictions on activities continue in many other regions, particularly those where vaccination rates lag, continuing to impact consumer activity in those regions. Concerns remain that our markets could see a resurgence of cases triggering additional government mandated lockdowns or similar restrictions on activity, for example due to the emergence of a variant against which existing vaccines are not as effective or which may be more easily transmitted, particularly to those unvaccinated. These conditions have had and will continue to have a negative impact on market conditions and customer demand throughout the world.\nWe expect continued, if uneven, global economic recovery. We have also experienced continued substantial delivered product cost inflation. While we expect the challenges that affected us and the rest of the world in the fourth quarter to continue into the first quarter of 2022, assuming the rate of cost inflation and COVID impacts ease progressively in the second half of the year, we believe our continued actions should help us deliver improved results in 2022.\nGlobal Economies\nApproximately half of our sales are outside of the U.S. Our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results.\nArgentina has continued to experience negative economic trends, evidenced by multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the Argentine Peso, and increasing borrowing rates. Argentina is classified as a highly inflationary economy in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Argentina. During 2021, sales in Argentina represented less than 1% of our consolidated sales. Assets held in Argentina at the end of 2021 represented less than 1% of our consolidated assets.\nIn February 2022, the U.S. and the European Union responded to Russia's invasion of Ukraine by imposing various economic sanctions. The U.S. and other countries could impose wider sanctions or take further actions if the conflict escalates. While it is difficult to anticipate the impact the sanctions may have on Ecolab, any further sanctions imposed or actions taken by the U.S. or other countries, or any retaliatory measures by Russia in response, could increase our costs, reduce our sales and earnings or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations. During 2021, net sales to Russia and Ukraine were approximately 1% of consolidated net sales.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThis MD&A includes financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include:\n\u25cf Fixed currency sales\n\u25cf Adjusted net sales\n\u25cf Adjusted fixed currency sales\n\u25cf Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales\n\u25cf Adjusted cost of sales\n\u25cf Adjusted gross margin\n\u25cf Fixed currency operating income\n\u25cf Fixed currency operating income margin\n\u25cf Adjusted operating income\n\u25cf Adjusted operating income margin\n\u25cf Adjusted fixed currency operating income\n\u25cf Adjusted fixed currency operating income margin\n\u25cf Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income\n\u25cf Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin\n\u25cf Adjusted other (income) expense\n \u25cf Adjusted interest expense, net  \u25cf EBITDA\n\u25cf Adjusted tax rate\n\u25cf Adjusted net income from discontinued operations, net of tax\n\u25cf Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Ecolab\n\u25cf Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations\nWe provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.\nOur non-GAAP adjusted financial measure for net sales excludes Purolite sales. Our non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for cost of sales, gross margin, operating income, other (income) expense and interest expense exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges and (with the exception of other (income) expense) the impact of the Purolite transaction, and our non-GAAP measures for tax rate, net income from continuing operations attributable to Ecolab and diluted EPS from continuing operations further exclude the impact of discrete tax items. We include items within special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items that we believe can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results. After tax special (gains) and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pre-tax special (gains) and charges.\nEBITDA is defined as the sum of net income including non-controlling interest, provision for income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is used in our net debt to EBITDA ratio, which we view as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization.\nWe evaluate the performance of our international operations based on fixed currency rates of foreign exchange. Fixed currency amounts included in this Form 10-K are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed foreign currency exchange rates established by management at the beginning of 2021. We also provide our segment results based on public currency rates for international purposes.\nOur reportable segments do not include the impact of intangible asset amortization from the Nalco merger or the impact of special (gains) and charges as these are not allocated to the Company's reportable segments.\nAcquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture and the Venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods. In addition, as part of the separation, we also entered into a Master Cross Supply and Product Transfer agreement with ChampionX to provide, receive or transfer certain products for a period up to 36 months. Sales of product to ChampionX under this agreement are recorded in product and equipment sales in the Corporate segment along with the related cost of sales. These transactions are removed from the consolidated results as part of the calculation of the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures included in this MD&A and we have provided reconciliations of reported U.S. GAAP amounts to the non-GAAP amounts.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following management discussion and analysis ( MD&A\u201d) provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. We provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level. We also provide quantitative information regarding special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. Such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature. Qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance.\nThe discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This discussion contains various Non-GAAP Financial Measures and also contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d at the end of this MD&A, and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d within Items 1 and 1A of this Form 10-K. We also refer readers to the tables within the section entitled Results of Operations\u201d of this MD&A for reconciliation information of Non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP.\nComparability of Results\nPurolite acquisition\nOn December 1, 2021, we acquired Purolite for total consideration of $3.7 billion in cash. Purolite is a leading and fast-growing global provider of high-end ion exchange resins for the separation and purification of solutions for pharmaceutical and industrial applications. Headquartered in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, Purolite operates in more than 30 countries. Purolite is reported within our Life Sciences operating segment. Acquisition and integration charges are recorded within special (gains) and charges.\nIn addition, the remaining impacts of the Purolite acquisition including operating results, acquisition-related amortization and interest expense related to the transaction have also been excluded from adjusted results.\nChampionX Transaction\nOn June 3, 2020, we completed the previously announced separation of our Upstream Energy business (the ChampionX business\u201d) in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the Transaction\u201d) through the split-off of ChampionX Holding Inc. ( ChampionX\u201d), formed by Ecolab as a wholly owned subsidiary to hold the ChampionX Business, followed immediately by the merger of ChampionX (the Merger\u201d) with a wholly owned subsidiary of ChampionX Corporation (f/k/a Apergy Corporation, Apergy\u201d).\nThe ChampionX business met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations because the separation of ChampionX was a strategic shift in business that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, we report the historical results of ChampionX, including the results of operations, cash flows, and related assets and liabilities, as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein. Unless otherwise noted, the accompanying MD&A has been revised to reflect the ChampionX business as discontinued operations and prior year balances have been revised accordingly to reflect continuing operations only.\nComparability of Reportable Segments\nEffective in the first quarter of 2020, and in anticipation of the separation of the Upstream Energy business, we created the Upstream and Downstream operating segments from the Global Energy operating segment, which was also a reportable segment. Subsequent to the separation of ChampionX, we no longer report the Upstream Energy segment, which previously held the ChampionX business.\nThe Downstream operating segment has been aggregated into the Global Industrial reportable segment. Also, in the first quarter of 2020, we announced leadership changes which allow for shared oversight and focus on the Healthcare and Life Sciences operating segments and established the Global Healthcare & Life Sciences reportable segment. This segment is comprised of the Healthcare operating segment which was previously aggregated in the Global Institutional reportable segment and the Life Sciences operating segment which was previously aggregated in the Global Industrial reportable segment. Additionally, the Textile Care operating segment, which is now being reported in Other, had previously been aggregated in the Global Industrial reportable segment. We also renamed the Global Institutional reportable segment to the Global Institutional & Specialty reportable segment. We made other immaterial changes, including the movement of certain customers and cost allocations between reportable segments.\nImpact of Acquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture and the Venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods. As part of the separation, we also entered into a Master Cross Supply and Product Transfer agreement with ChampionX to provide, receive or transfer certain products for a period up to 36 months. Sales of product to ChampionX under this agreement are recorded in product and equipment sales in the Corporate segment along with the related cost of sales. These transactions are removed from the consolidated results as part of the calculation of the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.\nFixed Currency Foreign Exchange Rates\nManagement evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations. Fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into U.S. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. Public currency rate data provided within the Segment Performance\u201d section of this MD&A reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period and is provided for informational purposes only.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nIn 2021, we delivered strong sales performance in an environment where COVID-19 infections impacted business activity and further disrupted global supply chains which together, impacted the global recovery. Delivered product cost inflation and other supply constraints increased significantly but we undertook extraordinary measures to assure our customers were supplied with our critical products and services. Double-digit sales growth in the Institutional & Specialty and Other segments along with strong Industrial segment growth more than offset the Healthcare & Life Sciences segment's decline versus a very strong gain last year. Accelerating pricing and higher volume more than offset significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints, including the impact of Texas Freeze and Hurricane Ida, and the comparison to lower variable compensation last year.\nSales\nReported sales increased 8% to $12.7 billion in 2021 from $11.8 billion in 2020. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales increased 6% compared to the prior year. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increased 5% compared to the prior year.\nGross Margin\nOur reported gross margin was 40.2% of sales for 2021, compared to our 2020 reported gross margin of 41.4%. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and impacts from the Purolite transaction included in cost of sales from both 2021 and 2020, our adjusted gross margin was 40.9% in 2021 and 41.8% in 2020.\nOperating Income\nReported operating income increased 15% to $1.6 billion in 2021, compared to $1.4 billion in 2020. Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the impacts of the Purolite transaction, increased 11% in 2021. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 8% in 2021.\nEarnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Ecolab Per Common Share ( EPS\u201d)\nReported continuing operations diluted EPS increased 17% to $3.91 in 2021 compared to $3.33 in 2020. Special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years. Special (gains) and charges in 2021 include COVID-19 related charges, restructuring charges, debt refinancing charges, acquisition and integration charges, and litigation and other charges. Special (gains) and charges in 2020 include debt refinancing charges, restructuring charges, disposal and impairment charges, Healthcare product recall charges, acquisition and integration charges, COVID-19 related charges, and litigation and other charges. Special (gains) and charges in 2019 were driven primarily by the impact of restructuring charges, discrete tax items, acquisition and integration charges and litigation and other charges. The impact of the Purolite transaction was $0.02 per share dilutive to reported earnings per share from continuing operations (excluding special charges) as sales since its December 1, 2021 acquisition were more than offset by acquisition-related amortization and interest expense. Adjusted continuing operations diluted EPS, which exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, the impacts of the Purolite transaction and discrete tax items increased 17% to $4.69 in 2021 compared to $4.02 in 2020.\nBalance Sheet\nWe remain committed to maintaining A\u201d range ratings metrics over the long-term, supported by our current credit ratings of A-/A3/A- by Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investor Services and Fitch, respectively. Our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates.\nNet Debt to EBITDA\nOur net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) was 3.4 and 2.4 for 2021 and 2020, respectively. We view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. See the Net Debt to EBITDA\u201d table on page 44 for reconciliation information.\nCash Flow\nCash flow from continuing operations operating activities was $2.1 billion in 2021 compared to $1.7 billion in 2020. We continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, investments in our business, acquisitions, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments.\nDividends\nWe increased our quarterly cash dividend 6% in December 2021, bringing annual dividends declared to $1.95 per share. The increase represents our 30th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 85th consecutive year we have paid cash dividends. Our outstanding dividend history reflects our long term growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ( Notes\u201d).\nPreparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. As the impact of the pandemic continues to evolve, estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require judgment. These estimates and assumptions may change in future periods and will be recognized in the consolidated financial\ninformation as new events occur and additional information becomes known. To the extent actual results differ materially from those estimates and assumptions, our future financial statements could be affected.\nBesides estimates that meet the critical\u201d estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even from estimates not deemed critical. Our critical accounting estimates include the following:\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing service. Revenue from product and sold equipment is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of the product or delivery of the equipment. Revenue from service and leased equipment is recognized when the services are provided, or the customer receives the benefit from the leased equipment, which is over time. Service revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method and aligns with when the services are provided. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date because the effort provided by the field selling and service organization represents services provided, which corresponds with the transfer of control. Revenue for leased equipment is accounted for under Topic 842 Leases and recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease contract.\nOur revenue policies do not provide for general rights of return. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives based primarily on historical experience and anticipated performance over the contract period. Depending on market conditions, we may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive. We also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits based on specific circumstances and credit conditions. We record an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on our estimates of expected future credit losses.\nThe revenue standard can be applied to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics if it is reasonable that the effects of applying the standard at the portfolio would not be significantly different than applying the standard at the individual contract level. We apply the portfolio approach primarily within each operating segment by geographical region. Application of the portfolio approach was focused on those characteristics that have the most significant accounting consequences in terms of their effect on the timing of revenue recognition or the amount of revenue recognized. We determined the key criteria to assess with respect to the portfolio approach, including the related deliverables, the characteristics of the customers and the timing and transfer of goods and services, which most closely aligned within the operating segments. In addition, the accountability for the business operations, as well as the operational decisions on how to go to market and the product offerings, are performed at the operating segment level. For additional information on revenue recognition, refer to Note 18.\nLitigation and Environmental Liabilities\nOur business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. Some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations.\nWe record liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs. We record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses. Expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain. While the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals, and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position. For additional information on our commitments and contingencies, refer to Note 16.\nActuarially Determined Liabilities\nPension and Postretirement Healthcare Benefit Plans\nThe measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries. These assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses.\nThe significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate, expected return on assets, projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table.\n \u25cf The discount rate assumptions for our U.S. plans are assessed using a yield curve constructed from a subset of bonds yielding greater than the median return from a population of non-callable, corporate bond issues that have an average rating of AA when averaging available Moody's Investor Services, Standard & Poor's and Fitch ratings. The discount rate is calculated by matching the plans' projected cash flows to the bond yield curve. For 2021 and 2020, we measured service and interest costs by applying the \n specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows. We believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans' liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. In determining our U.S. pension obligations for 2021, our weighted-average discount rate increased to 2.86% from 2.48% at year-end 2020. In determining our U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2021, our weighted-average discount rate increased to 2.75% from 2.37% at year-end 2020. \n \u25cf The expected rate of return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategies and views of investment advisors, and represents our expected long-term return on plan assets. Our weighted-average expected return on U.S. plan assets used in determining the U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care expenses was 7.00% for 2021, 7.25% for 2020 and 7.25% for 2019. \n \u25cf Projected salary and health care cost increases are based on our long-term actual experience, the near-term outlook and assumed inflation. Our weighted-average projected salary increase used in determining the U.S. pension expenses was 4.03% for 2021, 2020 and 2019. \n \u25cf For postretirement benefit measurement purposes as of December 31, 2021, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed to be 6.75% for pre-65 costs and 7.25% for post-65 costs. The rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 4.5% in 2029 and remain at those levels thereafter. \n \u25cf In determining our U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2021, we utilized the most recent mortality table, MP-2021 projection scale (applied to the Pri-2012 mortality table). \nThe effects of actual results differing from our assumptions, as well as changes in assumptions, are reflected in the unrecognized actuarial loss and amortized over future periods and, therefore, will generally affect our recognized expense in future periods. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations and expense. The unrecognized net actuarial loss on our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans decreased to $397 million as of December 31, 2021 from $691 million as of December 31, 2020 (both before tax), primarily due to current year net actuarial gains.\nThe effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of December 31, 2021, on the December 31, 2021 defined benefit obligation and 2022 expense is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant U.S. plans. Expense amounts reflect the accounting for actuarial gains as a component of other comprehensive income and recognition of the impacts into income over the remaining service period:\n\n\nOur international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans, with the majority of the amounts held in the U.K. and Eurozone countries. We use assumptions similar to our U.S. plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations, however, the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information.\nRefer to Note 17 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations.\nSelf-Insurance\nGlobally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses. We are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles, subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. We are self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. We determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis.\nIncome Taxes\nJudgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions.\nEffective Income Tax Rate\nOur effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions. We recognize the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances.\nTax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. As a result, the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities and Valuation Allowances\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of available evidence, both positive and negative, we recognize tax assets, such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not. Relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results, sources of future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nA number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter, for which we have established a liability for uncertain tax position, is audited and finally resolved. The number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) has completed examinations of our U.S. federal income tax returns through 2016 and the years 2017 and 2018 are currently under audit. In addition to the U.S. federal examinations, we have ongoing audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.\nThe tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal, state and international jurisdictions. We believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations, and our liabilities for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken. Because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations, we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits (including related interest and penalties) for amounts that do not meet the more-likely-than-not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance. The liability for uncertain tax positions is reviewed throughout the year, taking into account new legislation, regulations, case law and audit results. Settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments or receipts and/or adjustments to tax expense. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets within other non-current liabilities. Our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $25 million and $21 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For additional information on income taxes refer to Note 13.\nLong-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nLong-Lived and Amortizable Intangible Assets\nLong-lived and amortizable intangible assets acquired are recorded on the acquisition date at their respective fair values based on the fair value requirements defined in U.S. GAAP. This requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions relating to the present value of its future cash flows, such as growth rates, royalty rates or discount rates.\nWe review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $6.8 billion and $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for impairment when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the manner in which asset or asset groups are being used or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset or asset group. Impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset's or assets group's carrying amount over its estimated fair value.\nWe use the straight-line method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets, including our customer relationships. We consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships, including projected sales data, customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships.\nGlobally, we have a broad customer base. Our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions, including the customer bases acquired from our Nalco, Anios, CID Lines and Purolite transactions, which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships. Our historical retention rate, coupled with our consistent track record of keeping long-term relationships with our customers, supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer bases. If our customer retention rates or other post-acquisition operational activities change materially, we would evaluate the financial impact and significances of the events given rise to the change which could result in impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets, or absent an impairment, an acceleration of amortization.\nIn addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. Changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. We have experienced no significant changes in the carrying amount or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets.\nGoodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets\nWe had total goodwill of $8.1 billion and $6.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter. Our reporting units are aligned with our eleven operating segments.\nFor our annual 2021 goodwill impairment assessment, we completed a quantitative impairment assessment for each of our eleven reporting units using discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated assumptions, including future operating performance, long-term growth, and discount rates. Our goodwill impairment assessments for 2021 indicated the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying amounts of the respective reporting units by a significant margin. We assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may be higher than its fair value. Additionally, no events noted during the second half of 2021 indicated a need to update any of our analyses or conclusions reached in the second quarter of 2021 for any of our eleven reporting units. There has been no impairment of goodwill in any of the periods presented.\nThe Nalco trade name is our only indefinite life intangible asset. During the second quarter of 2021, we completed our annual impairment assessment of the Nalco trade name using the relief from royalty discounted cash flow method, which incorporates assumptions, including future sales projections, royalty rates and discount rates. Our Nalco tradename impairment assessment for 2021 indicated the estimated fair value of the Nalco trade name exceeded its $1.2 billion carrying amount by a significant margin. There has been no impairment of the Nalco trade name intangible since it was acquired.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n\nThe percentage components of the year-over-year sales change are shown below:\n\nAmounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.\nCost of Sales ( COS\u201d) and Gross Profit Margin ( Gross Margin\u201d)\n\nOur COS values and corresponding gross margin are shown above. Our gross margin is defined as sales less cost of sales divided by sales.\nOur reported gross margin was 40.2%, 41.4%, and 43.9% for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our 2021, 2020 and 2019 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special (gains) and charges of $93.9 million, $48.2 million, and $38.5 million, respectively. Special (gains) and charges items impacting COS are shown within the Special (Gains) and Charges\u201d table below.\nExcluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the impacts of the Purolite transaction, our 2021 adjusted gross margin was 40.9% compared against a 2020 adjusted gross margin of 41.8%. The decrease primarily reflected increased pricing and higher volumes which were more than offset by significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints, including the impact of the Texas Freeze and Hurricane Ida.\nExcluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our adjusted gross margin was 41.8% and 44.2% for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease primarily reflected the impact of lower volume, reduced operating leverage and unfavorable business mix, which more than offset pricing.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses ( SG&A\u201d)\n\nThe decreased SG&A ratio (SG&A expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2021 against 2020 was driven primarily by higher net sales, cost savings initiatives and reduction in bad debt, partially offset by higher variable compensation compared to last year. The decreased SG&A ratio comparing 2020 against 2019 was driven primarily by lower incentive compensation, discretionary spend reductions and cost savings initiatives which offset the effects of lower sales.\nSpecial (Gains) and Charges\nSpecial (gains) and charges reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income included the following items:\n\nFor segment reporting purposes, special (gains) and charges are not allocated to reportable segments, which is consistent with our internal management reporting.\nRestructuring Activities\nRestructuring activities are primarily related to the Institutional Advancement Program and Accelerate 2020, both of which are described below. These activities have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges, and other (income) expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFurther details related to our restructuring charges are included in Note 3.\nInstitutional Advancement Program\nWe approved a restructuring plan in 2020 focused on the Institutional business ( the Institutional Plan\u201d) which is intended to enhance our Institutional sales and service structure and allow the sales team to capture share and penetration while maximizing service effectiveness by leveraging our ongoing investments in digital technology. In February 2021, we expanded the Institutional Plan, and expect that these restructuring charges will be completed by 2023, with total anticipated costs of $65 million ($50 million after tax) or $0.17 per diluted share. The costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance and facility closures. We also anticipate non-cash charges related to equipment disposals. Actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken.\nIn 2021, we recorded total restructuring charges of $12.6 million ($10.2 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share, primarily related to severance, disposals of equipment and office closures. We have recorded $47.8 million ($36.6 million after tax), or $0.13 per diluted share of cumulative restructuring charges under the Institutional Plan. The liability related to the Institutional Plan was $5.1 million as of December 31, 2021. The majority of the pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters which continue to be funded from operating activities.\nThe Institutional Plan has delivered $41 million of cumulative cost savings with estimated annual cost savings of $50 million in continuing operations by 2024.\nAccelerate 2020\nDuring 2018, we formally commenced a restructuring plan Accelerate 2020 ( the Plan\u201d), to leverage technology and system investments and organizational changes. The goal of the Plan is to further simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidated facilities and focus on key long-term growth areas by further leveraging technology and structural improvements. During 2020, we expanded the Plan for additional costs and savings to further leverage the technology and structural improvements. Following the establishment of the separate Institutional Plan, we now expect that the restructuring activities will be completed by the end of 2022, with total anticipated costs of $255 million ($195 million after tax), or $0.67 per diluted share, over this period of time, when revised for continuing operations. Costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance costs and some facility closure costs relating to team reorganizations. Actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken.\nWe recorded restructuring charges of $5.3 million ($6.2 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share in 2021. The liability related to the Plan was $32.7 million as of the end of the year. We have recorded $244.5 million ($190.0 million after tax), or $0.66 per diluted share, of cumulative restructuring charges under the Plan. The majority of the pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters which continue to be funded from operating activities.\nThe Plan has delivered $300 million of cumulative cost savings with estimated annual cost savings of $315 million in continuing operations by 2022.\nOther Restructuring Activities\nDuring 2021, we incurred restructuring charges of $18.7 million ($17.0 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share, related to other immaterial restructuring activity. The charges primarily related to severance and asset write-offs.\nDuring 2020, we incurred restructuring charges of $1.8 million ($1.2 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, related to other immaterial restructuring plan. The charges are comprised of severance, facility closure costs, including asset disposals, and consulting fees.\nDuring 2019, net restructuring gains related to restructuring plans entered into prior to 2019 were $1.5 million ($1.1 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share.\nThe restructuring liability balance for all other restructuring plans excluding Accelerate 2020 and the Institutional Plan were $4.6 million and $5.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The reduction in liability was driven primarily by severance payments. The remaining liability is expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will continue to be funded from operating activities. Cash payments during 2021 related to all other restructuring plans excluding the Accelerate 2020 and Institutional Plan were $10.5 million.\nAcquisition and integration related costs\nAcquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2021 include $29.9 million ($23.5 million after tax) or $0.08 per diluted share. Charges are related to the Purolite Corporation ( Purolite\u201d), Copal Invest NV, including its primary operating entity CID Lines (collectively, CID Lines\u201d), and Bioquell PLC ( Bioquell\u201d) acquisitions and consist of integration costs and advisory and legal fees. Acquisition and integration costs reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2021 include $4.2 million ($3.3 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share and are related to the recognition of fair value step-up in the Purolite inventory. In conjunction with its acquisitions, we incurred $0.8 million ($0.6 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of special (gains) and charges reported in interest expense in 2021.\nDuring 2020, acquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income include $8.5 million ($6.9 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share. Charges are related to CID Lines, Bioquell and the Laboratoires Anios ( Anios\u201d) acquisitions and consist of integration costs and advisory and legal fees. Acquisition and integration costs reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2020 include $3.9 million ($3.2 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share and are related to the recognition of fair value step-up in the CID Lines inventory, severance and the closure of a facility. In conjunction with our acquisitions, we incurred $0.7 million ($0.6 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of special (gains) and charges reported in interest expense in 2020.\nDuring 2019, acquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income include $5.6 million ($4.1 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share. Charges are primarily related to the Bioquell and Anios acquisitions and consist of integration costs, advisory and legal fees. Acquisition and integration costs reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2019 include $7.6 million ($5.6 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share and are related to recognition of fair value step-up in the Bioquell inventory and facility closure costs. In conjunction with our acquisitions, we incurred $0.2 million ($0.1 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of special (gains) and charges reported in interest expense in 2019.\nDisposal and impairment charges\nDisposal and impairment charges reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income include $41.4 million ($41.5 million after tax) or $0.14 per diluted share in the 2020. During 2020, we recorded a $28.6 million ($28.6 million after tax) or $0.10 per diluted share impairment for a minority equity method investment due to the COVID-19 impact on the economic environment and the liquidity of the minority equity method investment. In addition, we recorded charges of $12.8 million ($12.9 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share related to the disposal of Holchem Group Limited ( Holchem\u201d) for the loss on sale and related transaction fees during 2020. Further information related to the disposal is included in Note 4.\nCOVID-19 activities\nCustomer demand for sanitizer products surged at the outset of COVID-19. We worked hard to meet the rapidly increasing demand and sold the vast majority of the sanitizer inventory. However, COVID-19 variant-related delays of customer's reopening and consumer activity resulted in a small portion of excess sanitizer inventory. We have recorded inventory reserves of $60 million during 2021 for excess sanitizer inventory and estimated disposal costs. During 2021 and 2020, we recorded charges of $36.8 million and $57.1 million, respectively, to protect the wages of certain employees directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We also recorded charges of $16.5 million and $2.4 million related to employee COVID-19 testing and related expenses during 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, we received subsidies and government assistance, which were recorded as a special (gain) of ($6.2) million and ($23.4) million during 2021 and 2020, respectively. COVID-19 pandemic charges are recorded in product and equipment cost of sales, service and lease cost of sales, and special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Total after tax net charges (gains) related to COVID-19 pandemic were $81.3 million or $0.28 per diluted share and $27.4 million or $0.09 per diluted share during 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOther operating activities\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded special charges of $0.3 million ($0.2 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share, $24.4 million ($16.0 million after tax) or $0.06 per diluted share and $10.5 million ($7.1 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share, respectively, recorded in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income primarily related to a Healthcare product recall in Europe.\nOther special charges of $18.4 million ($14.1 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share in 2021, $34.7 million ($33.9 million after tax) or $0.12 per diluted share recorded in 2020 and $21.4 million ($16.2 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share recorded in 2019 relate primarily to a specific legal reserve and related legal charges, partially offset by a litigation settlement in 2019, which are recorded in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income. We also recorded during 2020 a $7.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share, special charge related to the separation of ChampionX as a tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nOther (income) expense\nDuring 2021, we incurred settlement expense recorded in other (income) expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income of $37.2 million ($28.7 million after tax), or $0.10 per diluted share related to U.S. pension plan lump-sum payments to retirees.\nDuring 2020 and 2019, we recorded other expense of $0.4 million ($0.3 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share and $9.5 million ($7.2 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share, respectively, related to pension curtailments and settlements for ChampionX separation and Accelerate 2020. These charges have been included as a component of other (income) expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nInterest expense, net\nDuring 2021 and 2020, we recorded special charges of $32.3 million ($28.4 million after tax) or $0.10 per diluted share and $83.1 million ($64.0 million after tax) or $0.22 per diluted share, respectively, in interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income related to debt refinancing charges. In addition, during 2021, 2020 and 2019, an immaterial amount of interest expense was recorded due to acquisition and integration costs.\nOperating Income and Operating Income Margin\n\nOur operating income and corresponding operating income margin are shown in the previous tables. Operating income margin is defined as operating income divided by sales.\nOur reported operating income increased 15% when comparing 2021 to 2020 primarily driven by increased pricing and higher volume which more than offset significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints, including the impact of the Texas Freeze and Hurricane Ida and higher variable compensation compared to last year. Our reported operating income decreased 24% when comparing 2020 to 2019 primarily due to the overall negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on results, which yielded lower sales and reduced operating leverage, unfavorable business mix, more than offsetting cost savings, favorable pricing and higher variable compensation. Our reported operating income for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was impacted by special (gains) and charges. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the impacts of the Purolite transaction, 2021 adjusted operating income increased 11% when compared to 2020 adjusted operating income and 2020 adjusted operating income decreased 19% when compared to 2019 adjusted operating income.\nOther (Income) Expense\n\nOur reported other income was $33.9 million, $55.9 million and $77.0 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Excluding the impact of settlements and curtailments recorded in special (gains) and charges during 2021, 2020 and 2019, our adjusted other income was $71.1 million, $56.3 million and $86.5 million, respectively, reflecting lower interest costs associated with future payments of employee pension obligations.\nInterest Expense, Net\n\nOur reported net interest expense totaled $218.3 million, $290.2 million and $190.7 million during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe incurred $33.1 million ($29.0 million after tax), or $0.10 per diluted share, $83.8 million ($64.6 million after tax), or $0.22 per diluted share and $0.2 million ($0.1 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of interest expense special charges in conjunction with our debt refinancing and acquisitions during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAdjusted for special (gains) and charges and the Purolite transaction, the decrease in interest expense when comparing 2021 against 2020 was driven primarily by a reduction in average debt levels and average interest rates. The increase in our 2020 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2019 was driven primarily by higher outstanding debt.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table provides a summary of our tax rate:\n\nOur reported tax rate was 19.1%, 15.2%, and 16.7%, for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change in our tax rate includes the tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items, which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates, as amounts included in our special (gains) and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our tax rate, and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods. The tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future.\nWe recognized net tax expense of $5.8 million related to discrete tax items during 2021. This included a non-cash deferred tax expense of $25.1 million associated with transferring certain intangible property between affiliates. Share-based compensation excess tax benefit was $29.1 million. The amount of this tax benefit is subject to variation in stock price and award exercises. The remaining discrete tax expense of $9.8 million was primarily related to the filing of federal, state, and foreign tax returns and other income tax adjustments including the impact of changes in tax law, audit settlements and other changes in estimates.\nWe recognized a total net benefit related to discrete tax items of $55.8 million during 2020. The tax benefit related to share-based compensation excess tax benefit contributed $57.3 million. We recorded changes in reserves in non-U.S. and U.S. jurisdictions due to audit settlements and expiration of statutes of limitations which resulted in a $9.8 million tax benefit. Additionally, we recognized a net tax expense of $11.3 million primarily related to the filing of the prior year federal, state and foreign tax returns and other income tax adjustments.\nWe recognized total net benefit related to discrete tax items of $57.7 million during 2019. Share-based compensation excess tax benefit contributed $42.3 million in 2019. We recognized $15.6 million tax benefit related to changes in local tax law, which primarily includes $30.4 million benefit due to the passage of the Swiss Tax Reform and AHV Financing Act, a Swiss federal tax law, offset by a tax expense of $10.2 million due to the release of the final Treasury Regulation governing taxation of foreign dividends. We recorded changes in reserves in non-U.S. and U.S. jurisdictions due to audit settlements and statutes of limitations which resulted in a $13.8 million tax benefit. We finalized the 2015 and 2016 IRS audit, which also resulted in discrete tax expense of $11.0 million. The remaining discrete tax expense was primarily related to changes in estimates in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nThe change in our adjusted tax rates from 2019 to 2021 was primarily driven by global tax planning projects and geographic income mix. Future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors, including but not limited to other changes in global tax rules, further tax planning projects and geographic income mix.\nNet Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax\n\nSpecial charges reported in discontinued operations consist primarily of ChampionX separation charges.\nNet Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Ecolab\n\nDiluted EPS from Continuing Operations\n\nPer share amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.\nCurrency translation had an favorable $0.11 impact on reported and adjusted diluted EPS when comparing 2021 to 2020 and unfavorable $0.05 impact when comparing 2020 to 2019.\nSEGMENT PERFORMANCE\nThe non-U.S. dollar functional currency international amounts included within our reportable segments are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed currency exchange rates established by management for 2021. The difference between the fixed currency exchange rates and the actual currency exchange rates is reported as effect of foreign currency translation\u201d in the following tables. All other accounting policies of the reportable segments are consistent with U.S. GAAP and the accounting policies described in Note 2. Additional information about our reportable segments is included in Note 19.\nFixed currency net sales and operating income for 2021, 2020 and 2019 for our reportable segments are shown in the following tables.\n\nThe following tables reconcile the impact of acquisitions and divestitures within our reportable segments.\n\nGlobal Industrial\n\n* Not meaningful\nAmounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.\nNet Sales\nFixed currency sales for Global Industrial increased in 2021 as strong growth in Paper and Water, led by recovering market conditions, strong pricing and new business wins, along with a good growth in Food & Beverage, were offset by a decrease in Downstream sales growth. The 2020 sales decrease was impacted by regional declines in North America and Asia Pacific, partially offset by growth in all other regions.\nAt an operating segment level, Water fixed currency sales increased 6% in 2021 as strong new business wins and accelerating pricing leveraged recovering markets. Water fixed currency sales decreased 2% in 2020. Light industry water treatment sales had solid growth in 2021 and modest growth in 2020 led by good gains in food & beverage, light manufacturing and data centers. Heavy industry sales recorded a strong increase in 2021 driven by primary metals and were moderately lower in 2020, impacted by lower end market demand. Food & Beverage fixed currency sales increased 3% (2% acquisition adjusted) in 2021 primarily reflecting accelerating pricing, recovering markets and new business wins. Globally, we realized strong growth in beverage, brewing and modest growth in dairy. Fixed currency sales increased 5% (3% acquisition adjusted) in 2020, as share gains and pricing more than offset generally flat industry trends. Downstream fixed currency sales decreased 3% and 8% in 2021 and 2020, respectively, due to lower demand from COVID and impacts from the Texas freeze and Hurricane Ida impacts in 2021, while substantial reductions in transportation fuel demand and additive use hurt 2020 results. Paper fixed currency sales increased 11% in 2021 driven by increased pricing, strong new business wins, and increased ecommerce activity. Fixed currency sales were flat in 2020 despite softer industrial containerboard market conditions which reduced volumes in major regions.\nOperating Income\nFixed currency operating income and fixed currency operating income margins for Global Industrial decreased in 2021 and increased in 2020 when compared to prior periods.\nAcquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins decreased 2.1 percentage points in 2021 compared to 2020, as the 1.8 percentage point positive impact from accelerating pricing was more than offset by the 3.4 percentage point negative impact of significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints, including the impact of Texas Freeze and Hurricane Ida. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins increased in 2020, as the favorable impacts of cost savings, pricing, lower delivered product costs and lower variable compensation more than offset the negative impact of lower volume.\nGlobal Institutional & Specialty\n\n* Not meaningful\nAmounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.\nNet Sales\nFixed currency sales for Global Institutional & Specialty increased in 2021 driven by strong growth in the Institutional operating segment reflecting recovering markets, new business wins including gains from the Ecolab Science Certified programs, innovation and accelerating pricing and decreased in 2020 driven by a significant decline in the Institutional business due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAt an operating segment level, Institutional fixed currency sales increased 15% in 2021, driven by strong growth in the Institutional operating segment reflecting recovering markets in the U.S. and Europe, new business wins including gains from the Ecolab Science Certified programs, innovation and accelerating pricing. Fixed currency sales decreased 27% in 2020, reflecting strong hand and surface hygiene sales that were more than offset by the negative effects of mandated reductions for in-unit dining and domestic and international travel that significantly reduced foot traffic at full-service restaurants, occupancy rates at hotels and customer visits to other entertainment facilities through the year. Specialty fixed currency sales decreased 3% in 2021, as modest quickservice sales growth were more than offset by lower food retail sales. Quickservice sales showed a modest gain as new business wins more than offset impacts of COVID-19 restrictions and labor shortages. Food retail sales declined versus the strong sanitizer demand in 2020 and customer labor shortages that has resulted in reduced in-store services and associated product usage. Fixed currency sales increased 8% (5% acquisition adjusted) in 2020, as strong food retail sales growth, benefiting from continued expanded cleaning protocols and frequency in the grocery stores in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and new customer additions, was partially offset by moderately lower quickservice sales, which saw strong hand and surface sanitizer sales more than offset by COVID-19 pandemic related impacts on restaurant volumes.\nOperating Income\nFixed currency operating income for our Global Institutional & Specialty segment increased in 2021 and decreased in 2020 when compared to prior periods. Fixed currency operating income margins increased in 2021 after decreasing in 2020.\nAcquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins increased 5.2 percentage points during 2021, as the 6.9 percentage point positive impact from higher volume, accelerating pricing, and favorable mix more than offset the 2.4 percentage point negative impact of the comparison to lower variable compensation last year and higher delivered product costs. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins decreased during 2020 as margins were negatively impacted from volume declines, unfavorable mix and higher bad debt expense, which more than offset the positive impact of cost savings.\nGlobal Healthcare & Life Sciences\n\n* Not meaningful\nAmounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.\nNet Sales\nFixed currency sales decreased for Global Healthcare & Life Sciences in 2021 compared to a strong 2020 year when sales benefited from strong COVID-19 related demand and increased in 2020 as growth was driven by volume and pricing gains.\nAt an operating segment level, Healthcare fixed currency sales decreased 5% (8% acquisition adjusted) in 2021 reflecting the comparison against strong 2020 COVID-19 related hand and surface disinfection sales as well as softer elective surgical procedures activity in 2021 due to the rise in COVID variants during the year. Fixed currency sales increased 18% (16% acquisition adjusted) in 2020. Strong COVID-19 pandemic related hand and surface disinfection sales growth more than offset the unfavorable effects of delayed elective surgical procedures. Life Sciences fixed currency sales decreased 5% (4% acquisition adjusted) in 2021 as accelerating pricing was more than offset by volume declines versus the very strong 2020 driven by extraordinary COVID-19 demand last year. Fixed currency sales increased 35% in 2020, led by strong demand for biodecontamination units, business wins and pricing in our cleaning and disinfection programs for both the pharmaceutical and personal care markets, with strong growth in Europe and moderate North America gains.\nOperating Income\nFixed currency operating income for our Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment decreased in 2021 and increased in 2020 when compared to prior periods. Fixed currency operating income margins decreased in 2021 and increased in 2020.\nAcquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins decreased 2.7 percentage points in 2021, as the 1.8 percentage point positive impact from accelerating pricing was more than offset by the 3.5 percentage point negative impact of volume declines due to strong comparison against last year. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins increased in 2020 driven by strong volume gains, reduced discretionary spending and pricing, partially offset by negative impact of higher delivered product costs.\nOther\n\n* Not meaningful\nAmounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.\nNet Sales\nFixed currency sales for Other increased in 2021 led by strong growth in Pest Elimination as it benefited from new business wins and a recovering market. Fixed currency sales decreased in 2020 with declines in sales results mostly impacting North America and Europe.\nAt an operating segment level, Pest Elimination fixed currency sales increased 11% in 2021 reflecting strong growth in food and beverage plants, restaurants and hospitality markets. Fixed currency sales decreased 2% in 2020 with sales growth in food and beverage plants, grocery stores and healthcare facilities offset by the impact of lower restaurant and hospitality volumes impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to partial or full customer closures along with limited vendor access. Textile Care fixed currency sales increased 10% in 2021 and decreased 27% in 2020. Colloidal Technologies Group fixed currency sales increased 16% in 2021 and decreased 18% in 2020.\nOperating Income\nFixed currency operating income in Other increased in 2021 and decreased in 2020 as compared to the prior year. Fixed currency operating income margins increased in 2021 and declined in 2020.\nAcquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins in Other increased 3.3 percentage points in 2021, as the 4.4 percentage point positive impact from higher volume and increased pricing more than offset the 1.1 percentage point negative impact of the comparison to lower variable compensation last year. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins in Other decreased in 2020 reflecting lower volume and unfavorable mix negatively impacted margins, which more than offset positive impact of cost savings and pricing.\nCorporate\nConsistent with our internal management reporting, Corporate amounts in the table on page 39 include sales to ChampionX in accordance with the long-term supply agreement entered into with the Transaction post-separation, as discussed in Note 5, intangible asset amortization specifically from the Nalco merger and special (gains) and charges that are not allocated to our reportable segments. Items included within special (gains) and charges are shown in the table on page 33.\nFINANCIAL POSITION, CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY\nFinancial Position\nTotal assets were $21.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared to total assets of $18.1 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nTotal liabilities were $14.0 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared to total liabilities of $11.9 billion as of December 31, 2020. Total debt was $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2020. See further discussion of our debt activity within the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section of this MD&A.\nOur net debt to EBITDA is shown in the following table. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure discussed further in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section of this MD&A.\n\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\n\nWe continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in the business and pension obligations along with returning cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases.\nCash provided by operating activities increased $320 million in 2021 compared to 2020, driven primarily by $159 million in increased net income, $94 million in higher tax expense accruals associated with higher income, and an increase in accruals for variable compensation, partially offset by $83 million of increased investment in working capital. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $305 million in 2020 compared to 2019, driven primarily by $458 million of lower net income due to the impact of COVID-19, partially offset by $160 million of improvement in working capital.\nThe impact on operating cash flows of pension and postretirement plan contributions, cash activity related to restructuring, cash paid for income taxes and cash paid for interest, are shown in the following table:\n\nInvesting Activities\n\nCash used for investing activities is primarily impacted by the timing of business acquisitions and dispositions as well as from capital investments in the business.\nTotal cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired and net of cash received from dispositions, in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $3,924 million, $371 million and $385 million, respectively. Our acquisitions and divestitures are discussed further in Note 4. We continue to target strategic business acquisitions which complement our growth strategy and expect to continue to make capital investments and acquisitions in the future to support our long-term growth.\nWe continue to make capital investments in the business, including merchandising and customer equipment and manufacturing facilities. Total capital expenditures were $643 million, $489 million and $731 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFinancing Activities\n\nOur cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the issuances and repayment of debt, common stock repurchases, proceeds from common stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs and dividend payments.\nWe issued $2,800 million par value and received $2,775 million in proceeds of long-term debt and repaid $900 million of long-term debt in 2021. We issued $1,850 million par value and received $1,856 million in proceeds of long-term debt and repaid $1,570 million of long-term debt in 2020. We repaid $401 million of long-term debt in 2019. The proceeds received from the debt issuances were used for the Purolite acquisition, repayment of outstanding debt, repayment of commercial paper and general corporate purposes. In addition, we issued $394 million of commercial paper and notes payable in 2021 and repaid $66 million and $252 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nShares are repurchased for the purpose of partially offsetting the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans and stock issued in acquisitions, to manage our capital structure and to efficiently return capital to shareholders. We repurchased a total of $107 million, $146 million, and $354 million of shares in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe impact on financing cash flows of commercial paper and notes payable repayments, long-term debt borrowings and long-term debt repayments, are shown in the following table:\n\nIn December 2021, we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 6%. This represents the 30th consecutive year we have increased our dividend. We have paid dividends on our common stock for 85 consecutive years. We paid dividends of $566 million, $561 million and $553 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash dividends declared per share of common stock, by quarter, for each of the last three years were as follows:\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for the next twelve months, including scheduled debt repayments, new investments in the business, share repurchases, dividend payments, possible business acquisitions and pension and postretirement contributions with cash from operating activities, and as needed, additional short-term and/or long-term borrowings. We continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $360 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $181 million was held outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1,260 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $59 million was held outside of the U.S. We will continue to evaluate our cash position in light of future developments.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had a $2.0 billion multi-year credit facility, which expires in April 2026. The credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks and supports our U.S. and Euro commercial paper programs. The maximum aggregate amount of commercial paper that may be issued under our U.S. commercial paper program and our Euro commercial paper program may not exceed $2.0 billion. At year end, we had $400 million outstanding commercial paper under our U.S. program and no commercial paper outstanding on our Euro program. There were no borrowings under our credit facility as of December 31, 2021 or 2020. As of December 31, 2021, both programs were rated A-2 by Standard & Poor's, P-2 by Moody's and by Fitch.\nWe had a $305 million term credit agreement which we drew on and repaid $303 million during the second quarter of 2020. The credit agreement expired in June 2020.\nAdditionally, we have uncommitted credit lines with major international banks and financial institutions. These credit lines support our daily global funding needs, primarily our global cash pooling structures. We have $118 million of bank supported letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees outstanding in support of our commercial business transactions. We do not have any other significant unconditional purchase obligations or commercial commitments.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Standard & Poor's and Fitch both rated our long-term credit at A- (stable outlook) and Moody's rated our long-term credit at A3 (stable outlook). A reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or negotiate new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities.\nWe are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures.\nA schedule of our various obligations as of December 31, 2021 are summarized in the following table:\n\n * Interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at year end 2021. \nAs of December 31, 2021, our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $25 million. We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required. Therefore, these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.\nWe do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2021. We are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. We estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate $49 million in 2022. These amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.\nWe lease certain sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longer-term operating leases. Vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration. Vehicle leases have residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles.\nMarket Risk\nWe enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing monitoring and reporting, and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows.\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements, and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of \u20ac1,150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges.\nWe enter into cross-currency swap derivative contracts to hedge certain Euro denominated exposures from our investments in certain of its Euro denominated functional currency subsidiaries. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had \u20ac425 million of cross-currency swap derivative contracts outstanding designated as a net investment hedge.\nWe manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements. Under these arrangements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. As of December 31, 2021, we had $1,250 million of interest rate swaps outstanding.\nRefer to Note 9 for further information on our hedging activity.\nBased on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10% change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increase/decrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately $278 million. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.\nGLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT\nCOVID-19\nIn March 2020, the COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to affect major economic and financial markets and industries are facing the challenges with the economic conditions resulting from efforts to address the pandemic, including supply shortages, inflation and other challenges, such as those resulting from the introduction of vaccination mandates. While many government restrictions in the U.S. have eased throughout 2021, restrictions on activities continue in many other regions, particularly those where vaccination rates lag, continuing to impact consumer activity in those regions. Concerns remain that our markets could see a resurgence of cases triggering additional government mandated lockdowns or similar restrictions on activity, for example due to the emergence of a variant against which existing vaccines are not as effective or which may be more easily transmitted, particularly to those unvaccinated. These conditions have had and will continue to have a negative impact on market conditions and customer demand throughout the world.\nWe expect continued, if uneven, global economic recovery. We have also experienced continued substantial delivered product cost inflation. While we expect the challenges that affected us and the rest of the world in the fourth quarter to continue into the first quarter of 2022, assuming the rate of cost inflation and COVID impacts ease progressively in the second half of the year, we believe our continued actions should help us deliver improved results in 2022.\nGlobal Economies\nApproximately half of our sales are outside of the U.S. Our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results.\nArgentina has continued to experience negative economic trends, evidenced by multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the Argentine Peso, and increasing borrowing rates. Argentina is classified as a highly inflationary economy in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Argentina. During 2021, sales in Argentina represented less than 1% of our consolidated sales. Assets held in Argentina at the end of 2021 represented less than 1% of our consolidated assets.\nIn February 2022, the U.S. and the European Union responded to Russia's invasion of Ukraine by imposing various economic sanctions. The U.S. and other countries could impose wider sanctions or take further actions if the conflict escalates. While it is difficult to anticipate the impact the sanctions may have on Ecolab, any further sanctions imposed or actions taken by the U.S. or other countries, or any retaliatory measures by Russia in response, could increase our costs, reduce our sales and earnings or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations. During 2021, net sales to Russia and Ukraine were approximately 1% of consolidated net sales.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThis MD&A includes financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include:\n\u25cf Fixed currency sales\n\u25cf Adjusted net sales\n\u25cf Adjusted fixed currency sales\n\u25cf Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales\n\u25cf Adjusted cost of sales\n\u25cf Adjusted gross margin\n\u25cf Fixed currency operating income\n\u25cf Fixed currency operating income margin\n\u25cf Adjusted operating income\n\u25cf Adjusted operating income margin\n\u25cf Adjusted fixed currency operating income\n\u25cf Adjusted fixed currency operating income margin\n\u25cf Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income\n\u25cf Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin\n\u25cf Adjusted other (income) expense\n \u25cf Adjusted interest expense, net  \u25cf EBITDA\n\u25cf Adjusted tax rate\n\u25cf Adjusted net income from discontinued operations, net of tax\n\u25cf Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Ecolab\n\u25cf Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations\nWe provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.\nOur non-GAAP adjusted financial measure for net sales excludes Purolite sales. Our non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for cost of sales, gross margin, operating income, other (income) expense and interest expense exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges and (with the exception of other (income) expense) the impact of the Purolite transaction, and our non-GAAP measures for tax rate, net income from continuing operations attributable to Ecolab and diluted EPS from continuing operations further exclude the impact of discrete tax items. We include items within special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items that we believe can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results. After tax special (gains) and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pre-tax special (gains) and charges.\nEBITDA is defined as the sum of net income including non-controlling interest, provision for income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is used in our net debt to EBITDA ratio, which we view as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization.\nWe evaluate the performance of our international operations based on fixed currency rates of foreign exchange. Fixed currency amounts included in this Form 10-K are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed foreign currency exchange rates established by management at the beginning of 2021. We also provide our segment results based on public currency rates for international purposes.\nOur reportable segments do not include the impact of intangible asset amortization from the Nalco merger or the impact of special (gains) and charges as these are not allocated to the Company's reportable segments.\nAcquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture and the Venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods. In addition, as part of the separation, we also entered into a Master Cross Supply and Product Transfer agreement with ChampionX to provide, receive or transfer certain products for a period up to 36 months. Sales of product to ChampionX under this agreement are recorded in product and equipment sales in the Corporate segment along with the related cost of sales. These transactions are removed from the consolidated results as part of the calculation of the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures included in this MD&A and we have provided reconciliations of reported U.S. GAAP amounts to the non-GAAP amounts.", "item_7_tables": "Table 75: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>
