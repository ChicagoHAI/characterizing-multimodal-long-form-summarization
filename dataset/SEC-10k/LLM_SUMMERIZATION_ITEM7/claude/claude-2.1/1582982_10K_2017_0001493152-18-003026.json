Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and other factors that are expected to affect our prospective financial condition. The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSome of the statements set forth in this section are forward-looking statements relating to our future results of operations. Our actual results may vary from the results anticipated by these statements. Please see Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nMTBC is a healthcare information technology company that provides a fully integrated suite of proprietary web-based solutions, together with related business services, to healthcare providers. Our integrated Software-as-a-Service ( SaaS\u201d) platform is designed to help our customers increase revenues, streamline workflows and make better business and clinical decisions, while reducing administrative burdens and operating costs. We are able to deliver our leading solutions at very competitive prices because we leverage our proprietary software, which automates our workflows and increases efficiency, together with our highly educated and specialized offshore workforce of more than approximately 1,600 team members at labor costs that we believe to be approximately one-tenth the cost of comparable U.S.\nOur flagship offering, PracticePro\u2122, empowers healthcare practices with the core software and business services they need to address industry challenges on one unified SaaS platform. We deliver powerful, integrated and easy-to-use \u2018big practice solutions' to small and medium practices, which enable them to efficiently operate their businesses, manage clinical workflows and receive timely payment for their services. PracticePro consists of:\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Practice management software and related tools, which facilitate the day-to-day operation of a medical practice; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Electronic health records ( EHR\u201d), which are easy to use, highly ranked, and allow our clients to reduce paperwork and qualify for government incentives; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Revenue cycle management ( RCM\u201d) services, which include end-to-end medical billing, analytics, and related services; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Mobile Health ( mHealth\u201d) solutions, including smartphone applications that assist patients and healthcare providers in the provision of healthcare services. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile many of our clients leverage our full PracticePro suite, we also have a number of clients who utilize other popular EHR software, and for which we provide RCM services, including medical billing, analytics, and related services.\nAdoption of our solutions requires little or no upfront expenditure by a provider. Additionally, our financial performance is linked directly to the financial performance of our clients because the vast majority of our revenues are based on a percentage of our clients' collections. The standard fee for our complete, integrated, end-to-end solution is among the lowest in the industry.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, the Company introduced two new products - talkEHR\u2122, a voice enabled EHR solution and EnrollmentPlus\u2122, a SaaS solution that streamlines the insurance enrollment workflow.\nThe Company has a clearinghouse service which allows clients to track claim status and includes services such as batch electronic claim and payment transaction clearing and web access for claim corrections. The Company also has an EDI service which provides a centralized electronic data interchange management system to record, manage and control the exchange of information. In addition, the Company has a printing and mailing operation.\nOur growth strategy involves both acquisitive and organic growth. Both prongs of our strategy have yielded positive results for us historically.\nTable 58: <table><tr><td>31 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWith regard to our acquisition strategy, we believe that it is becoming increasingly difficult for traditional RCM companies to meet the growing technology and business service needs of healthcare providers without a significant investment in information technology infrastructure. The RCM service industry is highly fragmented, with many local and regional RCM companies serving small medical practices. We believe that the industry is ripe for consolidation and that we can achieve significant growth through acquisitions.\nOur continued investment in sales and marketing during 2017 has helped us sign new customers which we expect will accelerate organic growth. First, we actively partner with industry participants who cross-market our services and otherwise provide referrals. Second, our newly launched talkEHR is a free product, but is designed to encourage users to upgrade to a revenue-generating, premium billing solution. Since the third quarter launch of talkEHR, more than 950 providers have signed-up for talkEHR and a few have already upgraded to our premium billing. As we move forward, we intend to continue to strategically promote talkEHR to new users, while encouraging providers who have already signed-up to actively use talkEHR in their day-to-day practice and upgrade to our premium billing solution. Third, a key part of our organic growth strategy for larger groups involves active attendance and participation in industry tradeshows.\nOur offshore operations in Pakistan and Sri Lanka together accounted for approximately 29% and 27% of total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A significant portion of those expenses were personnel-related costs (approximately 78% and 75% of foreign costs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016). Because personnel-related costs are significantly lower in Pakistan and Sri Lanka than in the U.S. and many other offshore locations, we believe our offshore operations give us a competitive advantage over many industry participants. All of the medical billing companies that we have acquired used domestic labor or subcontractors from higher cost locations to provide all or a substantial portion of their services. We are able to achieve significant cost reductions as we shift these labor costs to our offshore operations.\nOn October 3, 2016, MTBC acquired substantially all the medical billing business and assets of MediGain, LLC and its subsidiary Millennium Practice Management Associates, LLC as well as offshore subsidiaries in India and Sri Lanka. During 2017, the Company integrated the acquired operations, reducing expenses and redundant operations and positions. The MediGain operations resulted in accretive revenue of approximately $13.6 million for 2017.\nKey Performance Measures\nWe consider numerous factors in assessing our performance. Key performance measures used by management, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share, are non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe better enable management and investors to analyze and compare the underlying business results from period to period.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of our business as determined in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis, and we provide reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share provide an alternative view of performance used by management and we believe that an investor's understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing these adjusted performance measures.\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes the following elements which are included in GAAP net income (loss):\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest on principal payments, on our debt; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Foreign currency gains and losses and asset impairment charges and other non-operating expenditures;

</tr>\n</table>\nKey Metrics\nIn addition to the line items in our consolidated financial statements, we regularly review the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends in our business, prepare financial projections, make strategic business decisions, and assess market share trends and working capital needs. We believe information on these metrics is useful for investors to understand the underlying trends in our business.\nSet forth below are our key operating and financial metrics for RCM customers using our Company platform, which excludes acquired customers who have not migrated to our platform as well as customers of our clearinghouse, EDI and other services. Revenue from practices using our platform accounted for approximately 46% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 and approximately 71% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFirst Pass Acceptance Rate: We define first pass acceptance rate as the percentage of claims submitted electronically by us to insurers and clearinghouses that are accepted on the first submission and are not rejected for reasons such as insufficient information or improper coding. Clearinghouses are third parties that process the submission of claims to insurers and require compliance with insurance companies' formatting and other submission rules before submitting those claims. For the purposes of calculating first pass acceptance rate, consistent with industry practice, we exclude claims submitted under real-time adjudication procedures, which are procedures that allow a healthcare provider to determine, at the point of care, if a service they are rendering will be paid. Our first-time acceptance rate was approximately 96% for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, which compares favorably to the average of the top twelve payers of approximately 95%, as reported by the American Medical Association.\nFirst Pass Resolution Rate: First pass resolution rate measures the percentage of primary claims that are favorably adjudicated and closed upon a single submission. Our first pass resolution rate was approximately 94% for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nDays in Accounts Receivable: Days in accounts receivable measures the median number of days between the day a claim is submitted by us on behalf of our customer, and the date the claim is paid to our customer. Our clients' median days in accounts receivable was approximately 37 days for primary care and 41 days for combined specialties for the year ended December 31, 2017, and approximately 33 days for primary care and 40 days for combined specialties for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the national average of 36 and 40 days, respectively, as reported by the Medical Group Management Association, an association for professional administrators and leaders of medical group practices in 2016. Higher first pass resolution rates and effective follow-up helped us to achieve this rate, which reduces our customers' collection cycle of claims, leading to increased revenue and customer satisfaction.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td>37 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCustomer Renewal Rate: Our customer renewal rate measures the percentage of our clients who were a party to a services agreement with us on January 1 of a particular year and continued to operate and be a client on December 31 of the same year. It also includes acquired accounts, if they are a party to a services agreement with the company we acquired and are generating revenue for us, so long as the risk of client loss under the respective purchase agreement has fully shifted to us by January 1 of the particular year. Our renewal rates for 2017 and 2016 were 90% and 85%, respectively. The renewal rates for our customers who are also users of our EHR for 2017 and 2016 were 98% and 97%, respectively. The percentage of our revenue generated during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 which came from all users of our EHR was 32% and 39%, respectively.\nProviders and Practices Served: As of December 31, 2017, we provided RCM and related services to approximately 3,500 providers (which we define as physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other clinical staff that render bills for their services), representing approximately 750 practices. In addition, we served approximately 230 clients who were not medical practices, but are service organizations who serve the healthcare community. As of December 31, 2016, we served approximately 2,800 providers representing approximately 830 practices.\nSources of Revenue\nRevenue: We primarily derive our revenues from revenue cycle management services, typically billed as a percentage of payments collected by our customers. This fee includes RCM as well as the ability to use our EHR and practice management software as part of the bundled fee. These payments accounted for approximately 89% and 88% of our revenues during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This includes customers utilizing our proprietary product suite, PracticePro, as well as customers from acquisitions which we are servicing utilizing third-party software. Key drivers of our revenue include growth in the number of providers we are servicing, the number of patients served by those providers, and collections by those providers. We also generate revenues from the sale of our stand-alone web-based EHR solution and from transcription, coding, indexing and other ancillary services. Our plan is to move customers acquired through acquisitions to our operating platform in order to increase efficiencies wherever feasible without jeopardizing the client relationship. By the end of 2017, we moved approximately 65% of the medical billing customers from prior acquisitions that were on other platforms to our operating platform.\nWe earned approximately 2% and 3% of our revenue from clearinghouse and EDI clients during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We earned approximately 4% and 3% of our revenue from printing and mailing operations during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nDirect Operating Costs. Direct operating cost consists primarily of salaries and benefits related to personnel who provide services to our customers, claims processing costs, and other direct costs related to our services. Costs associated with the implementation of new customers are expensed as incurred. The reported amounts of direct operating costs do not include depreciation and amortization, which are broken out separately in the consolidated statements of operations. Our Pakistan and Sri Lanka operations accounted for approximately 37% and 35% of direct operating costs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As we grow, we expect to achieve further economies of scale and to see our direct operating costs decrease as a percentage of revenue.\nSelling and Marketing Expense. Selling and marketing expense consists primarily of compensation and benefits, commissions, travel, advertising expenses. These have been relatively low in the past (under 2% of our revenue through 2015), as we have often found it to be more economical to grow by the acquisition of other medical billing companies than by engaging in directed marketing efforts to prospective customers. However, in October 2016, we hired four sales and marketing personnel as part of MediGain acquisition. During 2017, we continued to invest in marketing, business development and sales resources to expand our market share, building on our existing customer base. Going forward, we will further invest in marketing, business development and sales resources.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs and third-party contractor costs. Because we incorporate our technology into our services as soon as technological feasibility is established, most costs are currently expensed as incurred. We expect our research and development expense to increase in the future in absolute terms, but decrease as a percentage of revenue. Consistent with our growth plans, we are hiring developers, analysts and project managers in an effort to streamline our operational processes and further develop our products.\nTable 76: <table><tr><td>38 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expense for administrative employees, including compensation, benefits, travel, occupancy and insurance, software license fees and outside professional fees. Our Pakistan and Sri Lanka offices accounted for approximately 28% and 26% of general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nContingent Consideration. Contingent consideration represents the portion of consideration payable to the sellers of some of our acquisitions, the amount of which is based on the achievement of defined performance measures contained in the purchase agreements. For acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2016, contingent consideration consists solely of cash. For an acquisition completed in 2014, contingent consideration included the Company's common stock, however, this obligation was settled and satisfied in 2017. Contingent consideration is adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period.\t\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation expense is charged using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets ranging from three to five years. Depreciation for computers is calculated over three years, while remaining assets (except leasehold improvements) are depreciated over five years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the lease term or the economic life of those assets.\nAmortization expense is charged on either an accelerated or on a straight-line basis over a period of three years for most intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions.\nIn 2017, our acquisition and purchase of customer relationships added approximately $120,000 of intangibles. Amortization expense related to the 2017 acquisition was approximately $35,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. In 2016, our acquisitions and purchases of customer relationships added $4.8 million of intangibles. Amortization expense related to the 2016 Acquisitions was $1.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense). Interest expense consists primarily of interest costs related to our working capital line of credit, term loans and amounts due in connection with acquisitions, offset by interest income. Our other income (expense) results primarily from foreign currency transaction gains (losses), and amounted to a foreign exchange gain of $249,000 and a foreign exchange loss of $92,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIncome Tax. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Although the Company is forecasting a return to profitability, it incurred cumulative losses, which make realization of a deferred tax asset difficult to support in accordance with ASC 740. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded against all deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nImpact of the U.S. Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d) into law. Effective January 1, 2018, among other changes, the Act (a) reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent, provides for a deemed repatriation and taxation at reduced rates on historical earnings (a Transition Tax\u201d) of certain non-US subsidiaries owned by U.S. companies and establishes new mechanisms to tax such earnings going forward. The Act limits the use of net operating losses generated after January 1, 2018 to 80% of taxable income. Similar to other multinational companies, the Act has implications for the Company. However, the provisional impact of the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 is not material to net income. For our deferred tax liability related to the amortization of goodwill for tax purposes, we have recorded a decrease of $196,000 with a corresponding net adjustment to the deferred tax benefit of that amount for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the Company's remaining deferred tax assets and liabilities, the Company has a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the U.S., which results in there being no U.S. deferred tax assets or liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet that need to be remeasured at the new 21% rate. Further, the Company determined that the new Transition Tax will be offset by U.S. tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards, and thus did not result in any incremental taxes payable. For the Transition Tax, further information is required to finalize the estimated amount of accumulated foreign earnings as well as to validate the amount of earnings represented by the aggregate foreign cash position as defined in the Tax Act. We expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118. The Company will continue to analyze the effects of the Act on its consolidated financial statements and operations. Any additional impacts from the enactment of the Act will be recorded as they are identified during the measurement period as provided in Staff Accounting Bulletin 118.\nTable 77: <table><tr><td>39 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense and related disclosures. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies, estimates, assumptions and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nWe believe that the accounting policies below are those policies that involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of judgment by our management. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. For a more detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies, please refer to Note 3 in the Company's consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nContingent Consideration\nIf a business combination provides for contingent consideration, the Company records the contingent consideration at fair value at the acquisition date. As a result of the acquisitions, the Company adjusts the contingent consideration liability at the end of each reporting period based on fair value inputs representing changes in the fair value of the Company's common stock, changes in forecasted revenue of the acquired entities and the probability of an adjustment to the purchase price. Critical estimates include determining the forecasted revenue for certain acquisitions, probability and timing of cash collections and an appropriate discount rate. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration after the acquisition date are included in earnings if the contingent consideration is recorded as a liability.\nGoodwill Impairment\nGoodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually as of October 31st, referred to as the annual test date. The Company will also test for impairment between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at the reporting-unit level. The Company has determined that its business consists of a single reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the use of a discount cash flow and market approach methodology. These analyses require significant assumptions and judgments. These assumptions and judgements include estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, determination of our weighted average cost of capital and the selection of comparable companies and the interpretation of their data. Future business and economic conditions, as well as differences in actual financial results related to any of the assumptions, could materially impact the financial statements through impairment of goodwill or intangible assets and acceleration of the amortization period of the purchased intangible assets which are finite-lived assets. No impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, which requires that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The fair value amount assigned to intangible assets is based on an exit price from a market participant's viewpoint, and utilizes data such as discounted cash flow analysis and replacement cost models. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected client retention rates, expected future cash inflows and outflows and estimated useful lives of those intangible assets. ASC 805 also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combinations and are expensed as incurred.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide an allowance for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. If necessary, provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding receivables. In determining the provision, we analyze our historical collection experience, the aging of our accounts receivable, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends. We reassess this allowance each reporting period. If actual payment experience with our customers is different than our estimates, adjustments to this allowance may be necessary resulting in additional charges to our statement of operations.\nTable 78: <table><tr><td>40 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the years shown.\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Direct operating costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selling and marketing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in contingent consideration </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Restructuring charges </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>132.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.3 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32.4 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense - net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (expense) - net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.4 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35.2 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income tax provision </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.6 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36.0 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of 2017 and 2016\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,810,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,493,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,317,192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue.

Direct operating costs of $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $4.3 million or 32% from direct operating costs of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Salary costs increased by $1.6 million and $529,000 in the U.S. and Sri Lanka, respectively, as a result of MediGain acquisition. Postage and delivery costs increased by $437,000 due to the acquisition of WFS Services, Inc. Salary and other direct operating costs in Pakistan increased by $1.3 million or 34% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of additional employees in Pakistan hired to service newly acquired customers. In addition, software platform costs increased by $610,000. During the year ended December 31, 2017, salary and benefit costs for the subsidiary in Poland decreased by $148,000.\nSelling and Marketing Expense. Selling and marketing expense of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $118,000 or 10% from selling and marketing expense of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense of $11.7 million decreased by $721,000 or 6% from general and administrative expense of $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 which was primarily due to the decrease in salary cost from the MediGain acquisition due to the elimination of duplicate functions.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $180,000 or 20% from research and development expense of $902,000 in the prior year, as a result of adding additional technical employees in Pakistan performing software development work.\nContingent Consideration. The change in contingent consideration of $151,000 and ($715,000) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, relates to the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration. The loss in 2017 resulted from an increase in the price of the Company's common stock for the shares held in escrow from the acquisition of Practicare Medical Management, Inc. in 2014. The gain in 2016 resulted primarily from changes in the revenue estimates for the acquisitions made in 2015 and the 2016 Acquisitions and also from a decrease in the price of the Company's common stock for the shares held in escrow.\nDepreciation. Depreciation of $634,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $107,000 or 20% from depreciation of $527,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of additional property and equipment purchases and the MediGain acquisition.\nAmortization Expense. Amortization expense of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased by $915,000 or 20% from amortization expense of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease is due to the intangible assets acquired in the 2014 acquisitions becoming fully amortized during 2017, net of the additional amortization related to the MediGain acquisition.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges primarily represent employee severance costs, remaining lease and termination fees, disposal of property and equipment and professional fees associated with the closing of the operations in India and Poland. There were no similar costs incurred in 2016.\nTable 83: <table><tr><td>42 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,944 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,467 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,324,219 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(682,083 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(642,136 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(94 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (expense) - net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>332,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53,276 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>385,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>723 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income tax provision </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>196,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(128,997 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(66 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Income. Interest income of $17,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $19,000 or 53% from interest income of $36,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest income primarily represents late fees from customers.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $642,000 or 94% from interest expense of $682,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to additional interest costs on amounts related to the MediGain acquisition. Also, included in the 2017 interest expense is $463,000 of deferred financing costs related to the Opus credit agreement, which were written off in connection with the full repayment and termination of the loan agreement.\nOther Income (Expense) - net. Other income - net was $332,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to other expense - net of $53,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Included in other income (expense) are foreign currency transaction gains (losses) primarily resulting from transactions in foreign currencies other than the functional currency. These transaction gains and losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations related to the recurring measurement and settlement of such transactions. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2017 also includes $59,000 in cash received, net of obligations assumed, from the former owners of an acquired business in settlement of a dispute.\nIncome Tax Provision. There was a $68,000 provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $129,000 compared to the provision for income taxes of $197,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Included in the 2017 tax provision was a $26,542 deferred income tax provision related to the amortization of goodwill. The pre-tax loss decreased from $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Although the Company is forecasting a return to profitability, it incurred three years of cumulative losses which make realization of a deferred tax asset difficult to support in accordance with ASC 740. Accordingly, a valuation allowance was recorded against all deferred tax assets of $6.7 million and $7.2 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company's effective tax rate is (1.1%) and our Federal statutory tax rate is 34%. The primary reason for this difference pertains to the net operating loss incurred in the current year which could not be recorded as a benefit as the Company recorded a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets.\nThe Company has recorded goodwill as a result of its acquisitions. Goodwill is not amortized for financial reporting purposes. However, goodwill is tax deductible and therefore amortized over 15 years for tax purposes. As such, deferred income tax expense and a deferred tax liability arise as a result of the tax-deductibility of this indefinitely lived asset. The resulting deferred tax liability, which is expected to continue to increase over the amortization period, will have an indefinite life. This deferred tax liability could remain on the Company's consolidated balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment of goodwill (for financial reporting purposes) or a portion of the business is sold.\nSince the aforementioned deferred tax liability could have an indefinite life, it is not netted against the Company's deferred tax assets when determining the required valuation allowance. Doing so would result in the understatement of the valuation allowance and related deferred income tax expense.\nThe Company will maintain a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. While our plan is to be profitable in the future and begin utilizing these deferred tax assets, there is not sufficient evidence to allow us to avoid the full valuation allowance in 2016 and 2017. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and an income tax benefit for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the timing and level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve.\nThe Company has a Federal NOL carry forward of approximately $15.5 million which will expire between 2034 and 2037. The Company has state NOL carry forwards of approximately $14.7 million which will expire at various dates from 2034 to 2037.\nTable 85: <table><tr><td>43 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on future dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations; (5) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized; (6) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; and (7) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.\nThe Company has completed a preliminary analysis of the effects of the Tax Act on the Company and do not believe that it will have a significant impact as a result of the available Federal net operating losses available to the Company.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company had a cash balance of $4.4 million at December 31, 2017 and no outstanding amount drawn on its credit facility with SVB.\nDuring October 2017, the Company repaid and closed its Opus credit facility and replaced it with a $5 million revolving line of credit with SVB. Borrowings under the SVB facility are based on 200% of repeatable revenue, reduced by an annualized attrition rate, as defined in the agreement. The entire facility is currently available to the Company. As of December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all the covenants contained in the SVB credit agreement.\nIn October 2016 the Company made an initial $2 million payment toward the MediGain acquisition, which had a total purchase price of $7 million, and the remaining $5 million, plus interest, was paid during the third quarter of 2017.\nThe Company had a major turning point in liquidity during 2017, starting the year with $3.5 million in cash, $9.3 million of bank debt, a working capital deficit of $7.4 million and negative cash flows from operations of $889,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. In 2017, the Company generated $282,000 of positive cash flow from operations as the Company completed the integration of its 2016 Acquisitions and ended the year with $4.4 million in cash, positive working capital of $4.6 million and no bank debt. As profitability and liquidity improved during the year, the Company had fourth quarter 2017 cash flows provided by operating activities of $1.6 million, and also a net increase in cash for the quarter of $1.6 million.\nManagement achieved extensive expense reductions following the acquisition of MediGain in October 2016. The cost cutting included closing certain domestic and foreign facilities, eliminating reliance on subcontractors, and reducing non-essential personnel where work could be performed by offshore employees more cost-effectively.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years presented.\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>281,642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(889,342 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(902,211 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,833,482 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,843,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148,806 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(338,058 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,336 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net increase (decrease) in cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>885,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,562,682 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn September 2015, the Company secured a $10 million credit facility from Opus, including an $8 million term loan and a $2 million revolving line of credit. During October 2017, the credit facility with Opus was repaid and terminated, and replaced with a $5 million revolving line of credit from SVB. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts were drawn on the SVB credit line.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td>44 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe loss before income taxes was $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, of which $4.3 million was non-cash depreciation and amortization. Additionally, the loss included the non-cash write-off of the deferred financing costs due to the early termination of the Opus credit agreement amounting to approximately $463,000.\nDuring the year of 2017, the Company raised a total of $18.4 million in net proceeds from a series of equity financings. In May 2017, the Company completed a registered direct offering of one million shares of its common stock at $2.30 per share, raising net proceeds of approximately $2.0 million. Between June and December 2017, the Company completed six public offerings of approximately 765,000 shares of Preferred Stock at $25.00 per share, raising net proceeds of approximately $16.4 million.\nManagement continues to focus on the Company's overall profitability, including growing revenue and managing expenses, and expects that these efforts will continue to enhance our liquidity and financial position. Based on management's forecasts, the Company will have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations as they become due for the next twelve months from the date of financial statement issuance.\nCollectively, these developments dramatically improved the financial position of the Company.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $282,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to cash used in operating activities of $889,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the net loss of $3.2 million included the following changes in non-cash items: decrease in depreciation and amortization of $808,000, decrease in stock-based compensation of $391,000, net of an increase in the adjustment for contingent consideration of $867,000. Revenue increased by $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, and expenses increased by $3.9 million for the same period primarily due to the acquisition of MediGain in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAccounts receivable decreased by $42,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with an increase of $456,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Accounts payable, accrued compensation and accrued expenses decreased by $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with an increase of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $902,000, a decrease of $2.9 million compared to $3.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in spending is primarily due to only a small acquisition in 2017 for $205,000 compared to initial payments of $3.4 million for the 2016 Acquisitions.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.8 million, compared to $149,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash provided by financing activities during 2017 includes $16.5 million of net proceeds from issuing approximately 765,000 shares of preferred stock, $2.0 million raised from issuing one million shares of common stock, offset by $7.7 million of repayments for debt obligations, a $5 million payment to Prudential and $1.5 million of preferred stock dividends. Cash provided by financing activities the year ended December 31, 2016 included $2 million of additional term loan borrowings from Opus Bank before financing costs, offset by $1.4 million repayment of debt obligations, $709,000 of preferred stock dividends and $546,000 of repurchases of common stock. Average borrowings from our revolving line of credit were $660,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring October 2017, the Company replaced its Opus credit facility with a $5 million revolving line of credit from SVB. Borrowings under the credit facility are based on 200% of repeatable revenue reduced by an annualized attrition rate, as defined in the agreement. As of December 31, 2017, there were no amounts drawn on the line, and the full $5 million is currently available.\nIn connection with the common stock buy-back program, the Company purchased 644,565 of its shares for an aggregate cost of $546,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. No shares were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td>45 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe have contractual obligations under our line of credit and those related to contingent consideration in connection with the acquisitions made in 2015 and 2016.

Other than our operating leases for office space, computer equipment and other property, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and other factors that are expected to affect our prospective financial condition. The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSome of the statements set forth in this section are forward-looking statements relating to our future results of operations. Our actual results may vary from the results anticipated by these statements. Please see Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nMTBC is a healthcare information technology company that provides a fully integrated suite of proprietary web-based solutions, together with related business services, to healthcare providers. Our integrated Software-as-a-Service ( SaaS\u201d) platform is designed to help our customers increase revenues, streamline workflows and make better business and clinical decisions, while reducing administrative burdens and operating costs. We are able to deliver our leading solutions at very competitive prices because we leverage our proprietary software, which automates our workflows and increases efficiency, together with our highly educated and specialized offshore workforce of more than approximately 1,600 team members at labor costs that we believe to be approximately one-tenth the cost of comparable U.S.\nOur flagship offering, PracticePro\u2122, empowers healthcare practices with the core software and business services they need to address industry challenges on one unified SaaS platform. We deliver powerful, integrated and easy-to-use \u2018big practice solutions' to small and medium practices, which enable them to efficiently operate their businesses, manage clinical workflows and receive timely payment for their services. PracticePro consists of:\n \u25cf Practice management software and related tools, which facilitate the day-to-day operation of a medical practice; \u25cf Electronic health records ( EHR\u201d), which are easy to use, highly ranked, and allow our clients to reduce paperwork and qualify for government incentives; \u25cf Revenue cycle management ( RCM\u201d) services, which include end-to-end medical billing, analytics, and related services; and \u25cf Mobile Health ( mHealth\u201d) solutions, including smartphone applications that assist patients and healthcare providers in the provision of healthcare services. \nWhile many of our clients leverage our full PracticePro suite, we also have a number of clients who utilize other popular EHR software, and for which we provide RCM services, including medical billing, analytics, and related services.\nAdoption of our solutions requires little or no upfront expenditure by a provider. Additionally, our financial performance is linked directly to the financial performance of our clients because the vast majority of our revenues are based on a percentage of our clients' collections. The standard fee for our complete, integrated, end-to-end solution is among the lowest in the industry.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, the Company introduced two new products - talkEHR\u2122, a voice enabled EHR solution and EnrollmentPlus\u2122, a SaaS solution that streamlines the insurance enrollment workflow.\nThe Company has a clearinghouse service which allows clients to track claim status and includes services such as batch electronic claim and payment transaction clearing and web access for claim corrections. The Company also has an EDI service which provides a centralized electronic data interchange management system to record, manage and control the exchange of information. In addition, the Company has a printing and mailing operation.\nOur growth strategy involves both acquisitive and organic growth. Both prongs of our strategy have yielded positive results for us historically.\n 31 \nWith regard to our acquisition strategy, we believe that it is becoming increasingly difficult for traditional RCM companies to meet the growing technology and business service needs of healthcare providers without a significant investment in information technology infrastructure. The RCM service industry is highly fragmented, with many local and regional RCM companies serving small medical practices. We believe that the industry is ripe for consolidation and that we can achieve significant growth through acquisitions.\nOur continued investment in sales and marketing during 2017 has helped us sign new customers which we expect will accelerate organic growth. First, we actively partner with industry participants who cross-market our services and otherwise provide referrals. Second, our newly launched talkEHR is a free product, but is designed to encourage users to upgrade to a revenue-generating, premium billing solution. Since the third quarter launch of talkEHR, more than 950 providers have signed-up for talkEHR and a few have already upgraded to our premium billing. As we move forward, we intend to continue to strategically promote talkEHR to new users, while encouraging providers who have already signed-up to actively use talkEHR in their day-to-day practice and upgrade to our premium billing solution. Third, a key part of our organic growth strategy for larger groups involves active attendance and participation in industry tradeshows.\nOur offshore operations in Pakistan and Sri Lanka together accounted for approximately 29% and 27% of total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A significant portion of those expenses were personnel-related costs (approximately 78% and 75% of foreign costs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016). Because personnel-related costs are significantly lower in Pakistan and Sri Lanka than in the U.S. and many other offshore locations, we believe our offshore operations give us a competitive advantage over many industry participants. All of the medical billing companies that we have acquired used domestic labor or subcontractors from higher cost locations to provide all or a substantial portion of their services. We are able to achieve significant cost reductions as we shift these labor costs to our offshore operations.\nOn October 3, 2016, MTBC acquired substantially all the medical billing business and assets of MediGain, LLC and its subsidiary Millennium Practice Management Associates, LLC as well as offshore subsidiaries in India and Sri Lanka. During 2017, the Company integrated the acquired operations, reducing expenses and redundant operations and positions. The MediGain operations resulted in accretive revenue of approximately $13.6 million for 2017.\nKey Performance Measures\nWe consider numerous factors in assessing our performance. Key performance measures used by management, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share, are non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe better enable management and investors to analyze and compare the underlying business results from period to period.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of our business as determined in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis, and we provide reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share provide an alternative view of performance used by management and we believe that an investor's understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing these adjusted performance measures.\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes the following elements which are included in GAAP net income (loss):\n \u25cf Income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; \u25cf Interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest on principal payments, on our debt; \u25cf Foreign currency gains and losses and asset impairment charges and other non-operating expenditures; \u25cf Stock-based compensation expense and cash-settled awards, based on changes in the stock price; \u25cf Non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, and does not reflect any cash requirements for replacement for capital expenditures;

to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends in our business, prepare financial projections, make strategic business decisions, and assess market share trends and working capital needs. We believe information on these metrics is useful for investors to understand the underlying trends in our business.\nSet forth below are our key operating and financial metrics for RCM customers using our Company platform, which excludes acquired customers who have not migrated to our platform as well as customers of our clearinghouse, EDI and other services. Revenue from practices using our platform accounted for approximately 46% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 and approximately 71% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFirst Pass Acceptance Rate: We define first pass acceptance rate as the percentage of claims submitted electronically by us to insurers and clearinghouses that are accepted on the first submission and are not rejected for reasons such as insufficient information or improper coding. Clearinghouses are third parties that process the submission of claims to insurers and require compliance with insurance companies' formatting and other submission rules before submitting those claims. For the purposes of calculating first pass acceptance rate, consistent with industry practice, we exclude claims submitted under real-time adjudication procedures, which are procedures that allow a healthcare provider to determine, at the point of care, if a service they are rendering will be paid. Our first-time acceptance rate was approximately 96% for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, which compares favorably to the average of the top twelve payers of approximately 95%, as reported by the American Medical Association.\nFirst Pass Resolution Rate: First pass resolution rate measures the percentage of primary claims that are favorably adjudicated and closed upon a single submission. Our first pass resolution rate was approximately 94% for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nDays in Accounts Receivable: Days in accounts receivable measures the median number of days between the day a claim is submitted by us on behalf of our customer, and the date the claim is paid to our customer. Our clients' median days in accounts receivable was approximately 37 days for primary care and 41 days for combined specialties for the year ended December 31, 2017, and approximately 33 days for primary care and 40 days for combined specialties for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the national average of 36 and 40 days, respectively, as reported by the Medical Group Management Association, an association for professional administrators and leaders of medical group practices in 2016. Higher first pass resolution rates and effective follow-up helped us to achieve this rate, which reduces our customers' collection cycle of claims, leading to increased revenue and customer satisfaction.\n 37 \nCustomer Renewal Rate: Our customer renewal rate measures the percentage of our clients who were a party to a services agreement with us on January 1 of a particular year and continued to operate and be a client on December 31 of the same year. It also includes acquired accounts, if they are a party to a services agreement with the company we acquired and are generating revenue for us, so long as the risk of client loss under the respective purchase agreement has fully shifted to us by January 1 of the particular year. Our renewal rates for 2017 and 2016 were 90% and 85%, respectively. The renewal rates for our customers who are also users of our EHR for 2017 and 2016 were 98% and 97%, respectively. The percentage of our revenue generated during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 which came from all users of our EHR was 32% and 39%, respectively.\nProviders and Practices Served: As of December 31, 2017, we provided RCM and related services to approximately 3,500 providers (which we define as physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other clinical staff that render bills for their services), representing approximately 750 practices. In addition, we served approximately 230 clients who were not medical practices, but are service organizations who serve the healthcare community. As of December 31, 2016, we served approximately 2,800 providers representing approximately 830 practices.\nSources of Revenue\nRevenue: We primarily derive our revenues from revenue cycle management services, typically billed as a percentage of payments collected by our customers. This fee includes RCM as well as the ability to use our EHR and practice management software as part of the bundled fee. These payments accounted for approximately 89% and 88% of our revenues during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This includes customers utilizing our proprietary product suite, PracticePro, as well as customers from acquisitions which we are servicing utilizing third-party software. Key drivers of our revenue include growth in the number of providers we are servicing, the number of patients served by those providers, and collections by those providers. We also generate revenues from the sale of our stand-alone web-based EHR solution and from transcription, coding, indexing and other ancillary services. Our plan is to move customers acquired through acquisitions to our operating platform in order to increase efficiencies wherever feasible without jeopardizing the client relationship. By the end of 2017, we moved approximately 65% of the medical billing customers from prior acquisitions that were on other platforms to our operating platform.\nWe earned approximately 2% and 3% of our revenue from clearinghouse and EDI clients during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We earned approximately 4% and 3% of our revenue from printing and mailing operations during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nDirect Operating Costs. Direct operating cost consists primarily of salaries and benefits related to personnel who provide services to our customers, claims processing costs, and other direct costs related to our services. Costs associated with the implementation of new customers are expensed as incurred. The reported amounts of direct operating costs do not include depreciation and amortization, which are broken out separately in the consolidated statements of operations. Our Pakistan and Sri Lanka operations accounted for approximately 37% and 35% of direct operating costs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As we grow, we expect to achieve further economies of scale and to see our direct operating costs decrease as a percentage of revenue.\nSelling and Marketing Expense. Selling and marketing expense consists primarily of compensation and benefits, commissions, travel, advertising expenses. These have been relatively low in the past (under 2% of our revenue through 2015), as we have often found it to be more economical to grow by the acquisition of other medical billing companies than by engaging in directed marketing efforts to prospective customers. However, in October 2016, we hired four sales and marketing personnel as part of MediGain acquisition. During 2017, we continued to invest in marketing, business development and sales resources to expand our market share, building on our existing customer base. Going forward, we will further invest in marketing, business development and sales resources.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs and third-party contractor costs. Because we incorporate our technology into our services as soon as technological feasibility is established, most costs are currently expensed as incurred. We expect our research and development expense to increase in the future in absolute terms, but decrease as a percentage of revenue. Consistent with our growth plans, we are hiring developers, analysts and project managers in an effort to streamline our operational processes and further develop our products.\n 38 \nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expense for administrative employees, including compensation, benefits, travel, occupancy and insurance, software license fees and outside professional fees. Our Pakistan and Sri Lanka offices accounted for approximately 28% and 26% of general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nContingent Consideration. Contingent consideration represents the portion of consideration payable to the sellers of some of our acquisitions, the amount of which is based on the achievement of defined performance measures contained in the purchase agreements. For acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2016, contingent consideration consists solely of cash. For an acquisition completed in 2014, contingent consideration included the Company's common stock, however, this obligation was settled and satisfied in 2017. Contingent consideration is adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period.\t\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation expense is charged using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets ranging from three to five years. Depreciation for computers is calculated over three years, while remaining assets (except leasehold improvements) are depreciated over five years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the lease term or the economic life of those assets.\nAmortization expense is charged on either an accelerated or on a straight-line basis over a period of three years for most intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions.\nIn 2017, our acquisition and purchase of customer relationships added approximately $120,000 of intangibles. Amortization expense related to the 2017 acquisition was approximately $35,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. In 2016, our acquisitions and purchases of customer relationships added $4.8 million of intangibles. Amortization expense related to the 2016 Acquisitions was $1.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense). Interest expense consists primarily of interest costs related to our working capital line of credit, term loans and amounts due in connection with acquisitions, offset by interest income. Our other income (expense) results primarily from foreign currency transaction gains (losses), and amounted to a foreign exchange gain of $249,000 and a foreign exchange loss of $92,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIncome Tax. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Although the Company is forecasting a return to profitability, it incurred cumulative losses, which make realization of a deferred tax asset difficult to support in accordance with ASC 740. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded against all deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nImpact of the U.S. Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d) into law. Effective January 1, 2018, among other changes, the Act (a) reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent, provides for a deemed repatriation and taxation at reduced rates on historical earnings (a Transition Tax\u201d) of certain non-US subsidiaries owned by U.S. companies and establishes new mechanisms to tax such earnings going forward. The Act limits the use of net operating losses generated after January 1, 2018 to 80% of taxable income. Similar to other multinational companies, the Act has implications for the Company. However, the provisional impact of the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 is not material to net income. For our deferred tax liability related to the amortization of goodwill for tax purposes, we have recorded a decrease of $196,000 with a corresponding net adjustment to the deferred tax benefit of that amount for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the Company's remaining deferred tax assets and liabilities, the Company has a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the U.S., which results in there being no U.S. deferred tax assets or liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet that need to be remeasured at the new 21% rate. Further, the Company determined that the new Transition Tax will be offset by U.S. tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards, and thus did not result in any incremental taxes payable. For the Transition Tax, further information is required to finalize the estimated amount of accumulated foreign earnings as well as to validate the amount of earnings represented by the aggregate foreign cash position as defined in the Tax Act. We expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118. The Company will continue to analyze the effects of the Act on its consolidated financial statements and operations. Any additional impacts from the enactment of the Act will be recorded as they are identified during the measurement period as provided in Staff Accounting Bulletin 118.\n 39 \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense and related disclosures. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies, estimates, assumptions and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nWe believe that the accounting policies below are those policies that involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of judgment by our management. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. For a more detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies, please refer to Note 3 in the Company's consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nContingent Consideration\nIf a business combination provides for contingent consideration, the Company records the contingent consideration at fair value at the acquisition date. As a result of the acquisitions, the Company adjusts the contingent consideration liability at the end of each reporting period based on fair value inputs representing changes in the fair value of the Company's common stock, changes in forecasted revenue of the acquired entities and the probability of an adjustment to the purchase price. Critical estimates include determining the forecasted revenue for certain acquisitions, probability and timing of cash collections and an appropriate discount rate. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration after the acquisition date are included in earnings if the contingent consideration is recorded as a liability.\nGoodwill Impairment\nGoodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually as of October 31st, referred to as the annual test date. The Company will also test for impairment between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at the reporting-unit level. The Company has determined that its business consists of a single reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the use of a discount cash flow and market approach methodology. These analyses require significant assumptions and judgments. These assumptions and judgements include estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, determination of our weighted average cost of capital and the selection of comparable companies and the interpretation of their data. Future business and economic conditions, as well as differences in actual financial results related to any of the assumptions, could materially impact the financial statements through impairment of goodwill or intangible assets and acceleration of the amortization period of the purchased intangible assets which are finite-lived assets. No impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, which requires that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The fair value amount assigned to intangible assets is based on an exit price from a market participant's viewpoint, and utilizes data such as discounted cash flow analysis and replacement cost models. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected client retention rates, expected future cash inflows and outflows and estimated useful lives of those intangible assets. ASC 805 also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combinations and are expensed as incurred.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide an allowance for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. If necessary, provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding receivables. In determining the provision, we analyze our historical collection experience, the aging of our accounts receivable, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends. We reassess this allowance each reporting period. If actual payment experience with our customers is different than our estimates, adjustments to this allowance may be necessary resulting in additional charges to our statement of operations.\n 40 \nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the years shown.\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Direct operating costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selling and marketing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in contingent consideration </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Restructuring charges </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>132.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.3 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32.4 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense - net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (expense) - net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.4 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35.2 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income tax provision </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.6 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36.0 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of 2017 and 2016\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,810,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,493,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,317,192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue. Total revenue of $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $7.3 million or 30% from revenue of $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 included $17.0 million and $264,000 of revenue from customers we acquired from acquisitions in 2016 and 2017, respectively, offset by attrition from customers. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $7.3 million of revenue from customers we acquired from the 2016 Acquisitions.\n 41 \nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Direct operating costs </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,679,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,416,627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,262,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selling and marketing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,106,698 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,224,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(117,545 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,738,201 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,458,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(720,619 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,081,832 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>902,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in contingent consideration </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>151,423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(715,495 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>866,918 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>634,395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>527,072 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,665,548 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,580,963 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(915,415 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Restructuring charges </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>275,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>275,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,332,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,394,416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,938,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDirect Operating Costs. Direct operating costs of $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $4.3 million or 32% from direct operating costs of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Salary costs increased by $1.6 million and $529,000 in the U.S. and Sri Lanka, respectively, as a result of MediGain acquisition. Postage and delivery costs increased by $437,000 due to the acquisition of WFS Services, Inc. Salary and other direct operating costs in Pakistan increased by $1.3 million or 34% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of additional employees in Pakistan hired to service newly acquired customers. In addition, software platform costs increased by $610,000. During the year ended December 31, 2017, salary and benefit costs for the subsidiary in Poland decreased by $148,000.\nSelling and Marketing Expense. Selling and marketing expense of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $118,000 or 10% from selling and marketing expense of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense of $11.7 million decreased by $721,000 or 6% from general and administrative expense of $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 which was primarily due to the decrease in salary cost from the MediGain acquisition due to the elimination of duplicate functions.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $180,000 or 20% from research and development expense of $902,000 in the prior year, as a result of adding additional technical employees in Pakistan performing software development work.\nContingent Consideration. The change in contingent consideration of $151,000 and ($715,000) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, relates to the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration. The loss in 2017 resulted from an increase in the price of the Company's common stock for the shares held in escrow from the acquisition of Practicare Medical Management, Inc. in 2014. The gain in 2016 resulted primarily from changes in the revenue estimates for the acquisitions made in 2015 and the 2016 Acquisitions and also from a decrease in the price of the Company's common stock for the shares held in escrow.\nDepreciation. Depreciation of $634,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $107,000 or 20% from depreciation of $527,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of additional property and equipment purchases and the MediGain acquisition.\nAmortization Expense. Amortization expense of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased by $915,000 or 20% from amortization expense of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease is due to the intangible assets acquired in the 2014 acquisitions becoming fully amortized during 2017, net of the additional amortization related to the MediGain acquisition.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges primarily represent employee severance costs, remaining lease and termination fees, disposal of property and equipment and professional fees associated with the closing of the operations in India and Poland. There were no similar costs incurred in 2016.\n 42 \nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,944 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,467 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,324,219 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(682,083 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(642,136 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(94 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (expense) - net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>332,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53,276 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>385,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>723 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income tax provision </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>196,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(128,997 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(66 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Income. Interest income of $17,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $19,000 or 53% from interest income of $36,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest income primarily represents late fees from customers.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $642,000 or 94% from interest expense of $682,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to additional interest costs on amounts related to the MediGain acquisition. Also, included in the 2017 interest expense is $463,000 of deferred financing costs related to the Opus credit agreement, which were written off in connection with the full repayment and termination of the loan agreement.\nOther Income (Expense) - net. Other income - net was $332,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to other expense - net of $53,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Included in other income (expense) are foreign currency transaction gains (losses) primarily resulting from transactions in foreign currencies other than the functional currency. These transaction gains and losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations related to the recurring measurement and settlement of such transactions. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2017 also includes $59,000 in cash received, net of obligations assumed, from the former owners of an acquired business in settlement of a dispute.\nIncome Tax Provision. There was a $68,000 provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $129,000 compared to the provision for income taxes of $197,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Included in the 2017 tax provision was a $26,542 deferred income tax provision related to the amortization of goodwill. The pre-tax loss decreased from $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Although the Company is forecasting a return to profitability, it incurred three years of cumulative losses which make realization of a deferred tax asset difficult to support in accordance with ASC 740. Accordingly, a valuation allowance was recorded against all deferred tax assets of $6.7 million and $7.2 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company's effective tax rate is (1.1%) and our Federal statutory tax rate is 34%. The primary reason for this difference pertains to the net operating loss incurred in the current year which could not be recorded as a benefit as the Company recorded a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets.\nThe Company has recorded goodwill as a result of its acquisitions. Goodwill is not amortized for financial reporting purposes. However, goodwill is tax deductible and therefore amortized over 15 years for tax purposes. As such, deferred income tax expense and a deferred tax liability arise as a result of the tax-deductibility of this indefinitely lived asset. The resulting deferred tax liability, which is expected to continue to increase over the amortization period, will have an indefinite life. This deferred tax liability could remain on the Company's consolidated balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment of goodwill (for financial reporting purposes) or a portion of the business is sold.\nSince the aforementioned deferred tax liability could have an indefinite life, it is not netted against the Company's deferred tax assets when determining the required valuation allowance. Doing so would result in the understatement of the valuation allowance and related deferred income tax expense.\nThe Company will maintain a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. While our plan is to be profitable in the future and begin utilizing these deferred tax assets, there is not sufficient evidence to allow us to avoid the full valuation allowance in 2016 and 2017. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and an income tax benefit for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the timing and level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve.\nThe Company has a Federal NOL carry forward of approximately $15.5 million which will expire between 2034 and 2037. The Company has state NOL carry forwards of approximately $14.7 million which will expire at various dates from 2034 to 2037.\n 43 \nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on future dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations; (5) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized; (6) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; and (7) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.\nThe Company has completed a preliminary analysis of the effects of the Tax Act on the Company and do not believe that it will have a significant impact as a result of the available Federal net operating losses available to the Company.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company had a cash balance of $4.4 million at December 31, 2017 and no outstanding amount drawn on its credit facility with SVB.\nDuring October 2017, the Company repaid and closed its Opus credit facility and replaced it with a $5 million revolving line of credit with SVB. Borrowings under the SVB facility are based on 200% of repeatable revenue, reduced by an annualized attrition rate, as defined in the agreement. The entire facility is currently available to the Company. As of December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all the covenants contained in the SVB credit agreement.\nIn October 2016 the Company made an initial $2 million payment toward the MediGain acquisition, which had a total purchase price of $7 million, and the remaining $5 million, plus interest, was paid during the third quarter of 2017.\nThe Company had a major turning point in liquidity during 2017, starting the year with $3.5 million in cash, $9.3 million of bank debt, a working capital deficit of $7.4 million and negative cash flows from operations of $889,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. In 2017, the Company generated $282,000 of positive cash flow from operations as the Company completed the integration of its 2016 Acquisitions and ended the year with $4.4 million in cash, positive working capital of $4.6 million and no bank debt. As profitability and liquidity improved during the year, the Company had fourth quarter 2017 cash flows provided by operating activities of $1.6 million, and also a net increase in cash for the quarter of $1.6 million.\nManagement achieved extensive expense reductions following the acquisition of MediGain in October 2016. The cost cutting included closing certain domestic and foreign facilities, eliminating reliance on subcontractors, and reducing non-essential personnel where work could be performed by offshore employees more cost-effectively.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years presented.\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>281,642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(889,342 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(902,211 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,833,482 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,843,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148,806 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(338,058 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,336 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net increase (decrease) in cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>885,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,562,682 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn September 2015, the Company secured a $10 million credit facility from Opus, including an $8 million term loan and a $2 million revolving line of credit. During October 2017, the credit facility with Opus was repaid and terminated, and replaced with a $5 million revolving line of credit from SVB. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts were drawn on the SVB credit line.\n 44 \nThe loss before income taxes was $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, of which $4.3 million was non-cash depreciation and amortization. Additionally, the loss included the non-cash write-off of the deferred financing costs due to the early termination of the Opus credit agreement amounting to approximately $463,000.\nDuring the year of 2017, the Company raised a total of $18.4 million in net proceeds from a series of equity financings. In May 2017, the Company completed a registered direct offering of one million shares of its common stock at $2.30 per share, raising net proceeds of approximately $2.0 million. Between June and December 2017, the Company completed six public offerings of approximately 765,000 shares of Preferred Stock at $25.00 per share, raising net proceeds of approximately $16.4 million.\nManagement continues to focus on the Company's overall profitability, including growing revenue and managing expenses, and expects that these efforts will continue to enhance our liquidity and financial position. Based on management's forecasts, the Company will have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations as they become due for the next twelve months from the date of financial statement issuance.\nCollectively, these developments dramatically improved the financial position of the Company.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $282,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to cash used in operating activities of $889,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the net loss of $3.2 million included the following changes in non-cash items: decrease in depreciation and amortization of $808,000, decrease in stock-based compensation of $391,000, net of an increase in the adjustment for contingent consideration of $867,000. Revenue increased by $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, and expenses increased by $3.9 million for the same period primarily due to the acquisition of MediGain in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAccounts receivable decreased by $42,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with an increase of $456,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Accounts payable, accrued compensation and accrued expenses decreased by $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with an increase of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $902,000, a decrease of $2.9 million compared to $3.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in spending is primarily due to only a small acquisition in 2017 for $205,000 compared to initial payments of $3.4 million for the 2016 Acquisitions.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.8 million, compared to $149,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash provided by financing activities during 2017 includes $16.5 million of net proceeds from issuing approximately 765,000 shares of preferred stock, $2.0 million raised from issuing one million shares of common stock, offset by $7.7 million of repayments for debt obligations, a $5 million payment to Prudential and $1.5 million of preferred stock dividends. Cash provided by financing activities the year ended December 31, 2016 included $2 million of additional term loan borrowings from Opus Bank before financing costs, offset by $1.4 million repayment of debt obligations, $709,000 of preferred stock dividends and $546,000 of repurchases of common stock. Average borrowings from our revolving line of credit were $660,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring October 2017, the Company replaced its Opus credit facility with a $5 million revolving line of credit from SVB. Borrowings under the credit facility are based on 200% of repeatable revenue reduced by an annualized attrition rate, as defined in the agreement. As of December 31, 2017, there were no amounts drawn on the line, and the full $5 million is currently available.\nIn connection with the common stock buy-back program, the Company purchased 644,565 of its shares for an aggregate cost of $546,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. No shares were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n 45 \nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe have contractual obligations under our line of credit and those related to contingent consideration in connection with the acquisitions made in 2015 and 2016. We also maintain operating leases for property and certain office equipment. We were in compliance with all SVB covenants in 2017.\nThe following table presents certain payments due by the Company under our long-term contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of December 31, 2017. In addition, based on the obligations as of December 31, 2017, we expected interest expense to be approximately $20,000 during the years below.\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ending December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Notes payable </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>290 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>515 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Contingent consideration </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>603 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,408 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special-purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Other than our operating leases for office space, computer equipment and other property, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and other factors that are expected to affect our prospective financial condition. The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSome of the statements set forth in this section are forward-looking statements relating to our future results of operations. Our actual results may vary from the results anticipated by these statements. Please see Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nMTBC is a healthcare information technology company that provides a fully integrated suite of proprietary web-based solutions, together with related business services, to healthcare providers. Our integrated Software-as-a-Service ( SaaS\u201d) platform is designed to help our customers increase revenues, streamline workflows and make better business and clinical decisions, while reducing administrative burdens and operating costs. We are able to deliver our leading solutions at very competitive prices because we leverage our proprietary software, which automates our workflows and increases efficiency, together with our highly educated and specialized offshore workforce of more than approximately 1,600 team members at labor costs that we believe to be approximately one-tenth the cost of comparable U.S.\nOur flagship offering, PracticePro\u2122, empowers healthcare practices with the core software and business services they need to address industry challenges on one unified SaaS platform. We deliver powerful, integrated and easy-to-use \u2018big practice solutions' to small and medium practices, which enable them to efficiently operate their businesses, manage clinical workflows and receive timely payment for their services. PracticePro consists of:\n \u25cf Practice management software and related tools, which facilitate the day-to-day operation of a medical practice; \u25cf Electronic health records ( EHR\u201d), which are easy to use, highly ranked, and allow our clients to reduce paperwork and qualify for government incentives; \u25cf Revenue cycle management ( RCM\u201d) services, which include end-to-end medical billing, analytics, and related services; and \u25cf Mobile Health ( mHealth\u201d) solutions, including smartphone applications that assist patients and healthcare providers in the provision of healthcare services. \nWhile many of our clients leverage our full PracticePro suite, we also have a number of clients who utilize other popular EHR software, and for which we provide RCM services, including medical billing, analytics, and related services.\nAdoption of our solutions requires little or no upfront expenditure by a provider. Additionally, our financial performance is linked directly to the financial performance of our clients because the vast majority of our revenues are based on a percentage of our clients' collections. The standard fee for our complete, integrated, end-to-end solution is among the lowest in the industry.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, the Company introduced two new products - talkEHR\u2122, a voice enabled EHR solution and EnrollmentPlus\u2122, a SaaS solution that streamlines the insurance enrollment workflow.\nThe Company has a clearinghouse service which allows clients to track claim status and includes services such as batch electronic claim and payment transaction clearing and web access for claim corrections. The Company also has an EDI service which provides a centralized electronic data interchange management system to record, manage and control the exchange of information. In addition, the Company has a printing and mailing operation.\nOur growth strategy involves both acquisitive and organic growth. Both prongs of our strategy have yielded positive results for us historically.\n 31 \nWith regard to our acquisition strategy, we believe that it is becoming increasingly difficult for traditional RCM companies to meet the growing technology and business service needs of healthcare providers without a significant investment in information technology infrastructure. The RCM service industry is highly fragmented, with many local and regional RCM companies serving small medical practices. We believe that the industry is ripe for consolidation and that we can achieve significant growth through acquisitions.\nOur continued investment in sales and marketing during 2017 has helped us sign new customers which we expect will accelerate organic growth. First, we actively partner with industry participants who cross-market our services and otherwise provide referrals. Second, our newly launched talkEHR is a free product, but is designed to encourage users to upgrade to a revenue-generating, premium billing solution. Since the third quarter launch of talkEHR, more than 950 providers have signed-up for talkEHR and a few have already upgraded to our premium billing. As we move forward, we intend to continue to strategically promote talkEHR to new users, while encouraging providers who have already signed-up to actively use talkEHR in their day-to-day practice and upgrade to our premium billing solution. Third, a key part of our organic growth strategy for larger groups involves active attendance and participation in industry tradeshows.\nOur offshore operations in Pakistan and Sri Lanka together accounted for approximately 29% and 27% of total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A significant portion of those expenses were personnel-related costs (approximately 78% and 75% of foreign costs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016). Because personnel-related costs are significantly lower in Pakistan and Sri Lanka than in the U.S. and many other offshore locations, we believe our offshore operations give us a competitive advantage over many industry participants. All of the medical billing companies that we have acquired used domestic labor or subcontractors from higher cost locations to provide all or a substantial portion of their services. We are able to achieve significant cost reductions as we shift these labor costs to our offshore operations.\nOn October 3, 2016, MTBC acquired substantially all the medical billing business and assets of MediGain, LLC and its subsidiary Millennium Practice Management Associates, LLC as well as offshore subsidiaries in India and Sri Lanka. During 2017, the Company integrated the acquired operations, reducing expenses and redundant operations and positions. The MediGain operations resulted in accretive revenue of approximately $13.6 million for 2017.\nKey Performance Measures\nWe consider numerous factors in assessing our performance. Key performance measures used by management, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share, are non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe better enable management and investors to analyze and compare the underlying business results from period to period.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of our business as determined in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis, and we provide reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share provide an alternative view of performance used by management and we believe that an investor's understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing these adjusted performance measures.\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes the following elements which are included in GAAP net income (loss):\n \u25cf Income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; \u25cf Interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest on principal payments, on our debt; \u25cf Foreign currency gains and losses and asset impairment charges and other non-operating expenditures; \u25cf Stock-based compensation expense and cash-settled awards, based on changes in the stock price; \u25cf Non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, and does not reflect any cash requirements for replacement for capital expenditures; \n 32 \n\nSet forth below is a presentation of our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\nAdjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin exclude the following elements which are included in GAAP operating income (loss):\n\nSet forth below is a presentation of our adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin, which represents adjusted operating income as a percentage of net revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n 33 \n\nAdjusted net income and adjusted net income per share exclude the following elements which are included in GAAP net income (loss):\n \u25cf Foreign currency gains and losses and asset impairment charges and other non-operating expenditures; \u25cf Stock-based compensation expense, including customer incentives and related fees, and cash-settled awards, based on changes in the stock price; \u25cf Amortization of purchased intangible assets; \u25cf Integration costs, such as severance amounts paid to employees from acquired businesses or transaction costs, such as brokerage fees, pre-acquisition accounting costs and legal fees, exit costs related to terminating leases and other contractual agreements, costs related to specific transactions and restructuring charges arising from discontinued operations; \u25cf Changes in contingent consideration; and \u25cf Income tax expense resulting from the amortization of goodwill related to our acquisitions. \nNo tax effect has been provided in computing non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share as the Company has sufficient carry forward losses to offset the applicable income taxes. The following table shows our reconciliation of GAAP net loss to non-GAAP adjusted net income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n 34 \n\n\nFor purposes of determining non-GAAP adjusted net income per share, the Company used the number of common shares outstanding at the end of the years December 31, 2017 and 2016, including shares which were issued but have not been settled, and considered contingent consideration. Accordingly, the end-of-period diluted common shares include 248,625 of contingently issuable shares at December 31, 2016. No tax effect has been provided in computing non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per common share as the Company has sufficient carry forward losses to offset the applicable income taxes. The table below shows the composition of end-of-period common shares.\n\n 35 \nQuarterly Results of Operations\n\n 36 \nReconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA\n\nKey Metrics\nIn addition to the line items in our consolidated financial statements, we regularly review the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends in our business, prepare financial projections, make strategic business decisions, and assess market share trends and working capital needs. We believe information on these metrics is useful for investors to understand the underlying trends in our business.\nSet forth below are our key operating and financial metrics for RCM customers using our Company platform, which excludes acquired customers who have not migrated to our platform as well as customers of our clearinghouse, EDI and other services. Revenue from practices using our platform accounted for approximately 46% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 and approximately 71% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFirst Pass Acceptance Rate: We define first pass acceptance rate as the percentage of claims submitted electronically by us to insurers and clearinghouses that are accepted on the first submission and are not rejected for reasons such as insufficient information or improper coding. Clearinghouses are third parties that process the submission of claims to insurers and require compliance with insurance companies' formatting and other submission rules before submitting those claims. For the purposes of calculating first pass acceptance rate, consistent with industry practice, we exclude claims submitted under real-time adjudication procedures, which are procedures that allow a healthcare provider to determine, at the point of care, if a service they are rendering will be paid. Our first-time acceptance rate was approximately 96% for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, which compares favorably to the average of the top twelve payers of approximately 95%, as reported by the American Medical Association.\nFirst Pass Resolution Rate: First pass resolution rate measures the percentage of primary claims that are favorably adjudicated and closed upon a single submission. Our first pass resolution rate was approximately 94% for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nDays in Accounts Receivable: Days in accounts receivable measures the median number of days between the day a claim is submitted by us on behalf of our customer, and the date the claim is paid to our customer. Our clients' median days in accounts receivable was approximately 37 days for primary care and 41 days for combined specialties for the year ended December 31, 2017, and approximately 33 days for primary care and 40 days for combined specialties for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the national average of 36 and 40 days, respectively, as reported by the Medical Group Management Association, an association for professional administrators and leaders of medical group practices in 2016. Higher first pass resolution rates and effective follow-up helped us to achieve this rate, which reduces our customers' collection cycle of claims, leading to increased revenue and customer satisfaction.\n 37 \nCustomer Renewal Rate: Our customer renewal rate measures the percentage of our clients who were a party to a services agreement with us on January 1 of a particular year and continued to operate and be a client on December 31 of the same year. It also includes acquired accounts, if they are a party to a services agreement with the company we acquired and are generating revenue for us, so long as the risk of client loss under the respective purchase agreement has fully shifted to us by January 1 of the particular year. Our renewal rates for 2017 and 2016 were 90% and 85%, respectively. The renewal rates for our customers who are also users of our EHR for 2017 and 2016 were 98% and 97%, respectively. The percentage of our revenue generated during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 which came from all users of our EHR was 32% and 39%, respectively.\nProviders and Practices Served: As of December 31, 2017, we provided RCM and related services to approximately 3,500 providers (which we define as physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other clinical staff that render bills for their services), representing approximately 750 practices. In addition, we served approximately 230 clients who were not medical practices, but are service organizations who serve the healthcare community. As of December 31, 2016, we served approximately 2,800 providers representing approximately 830 practices.\nSources of Revenue\nRevenue: We primarily derive our revenues from revenue cycle management services, typically billed as a percentage of payments collected by our customers. This fee includes RCM as well as the ability to use our EHR and practice management software as part of the bundled fee. These payments accounted for approximately 89% and 88% of our revenues during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This includes customers utilizing our proprietary product suite, PracticePro, as well as customers from acquisitions which we are servicing utilizing third-party software. Key drivers of our revenue include growth in the number of providers we are servicing, the number of patients served by those providers, and collections by those providers. We also generate revenues from the sale of our stand-alone web-based EHR solution and from transcription, coding, indexing and other ancillary services. Our plan is to move customers acquired through acquisitions to our operating platform in order to increase efficiencies wherever feasible without jeopardizing the client relationship. By the end of 2017, we moved approximately 65% of the medical billing customers from prior acquisitions that were on other platforms to our operating platform.\nWe earned approximately 2% and 3% of our revenue from clearinghouse and EDI clients during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We earned approximately 4% and 3% of our revenue from printing and mailing operations during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nDirect Operating Costs. Direct operating cost consists primarily of salaries and benefits related to personnel who provide services to our customers, claims processing costs, and other direct costs related to our services. Costs associated with the implementation of new customers are expensed as incurred. The reported amounts of direct operating costs do not include depreciation and amortization, which are broken out separately in the consolidated statements of operations. Our Pakistan and Sri Lanka operations accounted for approximately 37% and 35% of direct operating costs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As we grow, we expect to achieve further economies of scale and to see our direct operating costs decrease as a percentage of revenue.\nSelling and Marketing Expense. Selling and marketing expense consists primarily of compensation and benefits, commissions, travel, advertising expenses. These have been relatively low in the past (under 2% of our revenue through 2015), as we have often found it to be more economical to grow by the acquisition of other medical billing companies than by engaging in directed marketing efforts to prospective customers. However, in October 2016, we hired four sales and marketing personnel as part of MediGain acquisition. During 2017, we continued to invest in marketing, business development and sales resources to expand our market share, building on our existing customer base. Going forward, we will further invest in marketing, business development and sales resources.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs and third-party contractor costs. Because we incorporate our technology into our services as soon as technological feasibility is established, most costs are currently expensed as incurred. We expect our research and development expense to increase in the future in absolute terms, but decrease as a percentage of revenue. Consistent with our growth plans, we are hiring developers, analysts and project managers in an effort to streamline our operational processes and further develop our products.\n 38 \nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expense for administrative employees, including compensation, benefits, travel, occupancy and insurance, software license fees and outside professional fees. Our Pakistan and Sri Lanka offices accounted for approximately 28% and 26% of general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nContingent Consideration. Contingent consideration represents the portion of consideration payable to the sellers of some of our acquisitions, the amount of which is based on the achievement of defined performance measures contained in the purchase agreements. For acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2016, contingent consideration consists solely of cash. For an acquisition completed in 2014, contingent consideration included the Company's common stock, however, this obligation was settled and satisfied in 2017. Contingent consideration is adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period.\t\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation expense is charged using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets ranging from three to five years. Depreciation for computers is calculated over three years, while remaining assets (except leasehold improvements) are depreciated over five years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the lease term or the economic life of those assets.\nAmortization expense is charged on either an accelerated or on a straight-line basis over a period of three years for most intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions.\nIn 2017, our acquisition and purchase of customer relationships added approximately $120,000 of intangibles. Amortization expense related to the 2017 acquisition was approximately $35,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. In 2016, our acquisitions and purchases of customer relationships added $4.8 million of intangibles. Amortization expense related to the 2016 Acquisitions was $1.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense). Interest expense consists primarily of interest costs related to our working capital line of credit, term loans and amounts due in connection with acquisitions, offset by interest income. Our other income (expense) results primarily from foreign currency transaction gains (losses), and amounted to a foreign exchange gain of $249,000 and a foreign exchange loss of $92,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIncome Tax. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Although the Company is forecasting a return to profitability, it incurred cumulative losses, which make realization of a deferred tax asset difficult to support in accordance with ASC 740. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded against all deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nImpact of the U.S. Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d) into law. Effective January 1, 2018, among other changes, the Act (a) reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent, provides for a deemed repatriation and taxation at reduced rates on historical earnings (a Transition Tax\u201d) of certain non-US subsidiaries owned by U.S. companies and establishes new mechanisms to tax such earnings going forward. The Act limits the use of net operating losses generated after January 1, 2018 to 80% of taxable income. Similar to other multinational companies, the Act has implications for the Company. However, the provisional impact of the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 is not material to net income. For our deferred tax liability related to the amortization of goodwill for tax purposes, we have recorded a decrease of $196,000 with a corresponding net adjustment to the deferred tax benefit of that amount for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the Company's remaining deferred tax assets and liabilities, the Company has a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the U.S., which results in there being no U.S. deferred tax assets or liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet that need to be remeasured at the new 21% rate. Further, the Company determined that the new Transition Tax will be offset by U.S. tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards, and thus did not result in any incremental taxes payable. For the Transition Tax, further information is required to finalize the estimated amount of accumulated foreign earnings as well as to validate the amount of earnings represented by the aggregate foreign cash position as defined in the Tax Act. We expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118. The Company will continue to analyze the effects of the Act on its consolidated financial statements and operations. Any additional impacts from the enactment of the Act will be recorded as they are identified during the measurement period as provided in Staff Accounting Bulletin 118.\n 39 \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense and related disclosures. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies, estimates, assumptions and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nWe believe that the accounting policies below are those policies that involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of judgment by our management. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. For a more detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies, please refer to Note 3 in the Company's consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nContingent Consideration\nIf a business combination provides for contingent consideration, the Company records the contingent consideration at fair value at the acquisition date. As a result of the acquisitions, the Company adjusts the contingent consideration liability at the end of each reporting period based on fair value inputs representing changes in the fair value of the Company's common stock, changes in forecasted revenue of the acquired entities and the probability of an adjustment to the purchase price. Critical estimates include determining the forecasted revenue for certain acquisitions, probability and timing of cash collections and an appropriate discount rate. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration after the acquisition date are included in earnings if the contingent consideration is recorded as a liability.\nGoodwill Impairment\nGoodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually as of October 31st, referred to as the annual test date. The Company will also test for impairment between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at the reporting-unit level. The Company has determined that its business consists of a single reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the use of a discount cash flow and market approach methodology. These analyses require significant assumptions and judgments. These assumptions and judgements include estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, determination of our weighted average cost of capital and the selection of comparable companies and the interpretation of their data. Future business and economic conditions, as well as differences in actual financial results related to any of the assumptions, could materially impact the financial statements through impairment of goodwill or intangible assets and acceleration of the amortization period of the purchased intangible assets which are finite-lived assets. No impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, which requires that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The fair value amount assigned to intangible assets is based on an exit price from a market participant's viewpoint, and utilizes data such as discounted cash flow analysis and replacement cost models. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected client retention rates, expected future cash inflows and outflows and estimated useful lives of those intangible assets. ASC 805 also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combinations and are expensed as incurred.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide an allowance for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. If necessary, provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding receivables. In determining the provision, we analyze our historical collection experience, the aging of our accounts receivable, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends. We reassess this allowance each reporting period. If actual payment experience with our customers is different than our estimates, adjustments to this allowance may be necessary resulting in additional charges to our statement of operations.\n 40 \nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the years shown.\n\nComparison of 2017 and 2016\n\nRevenue. Total revenue of $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $7.3 million or 30% from revenue of $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 included $17.0 million and $264,000 of revenue from customers we acquired from acquisitions in 2016 and 2017, respectively, offset by attrition from customers. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $7.3 million of revenue from customers we acquired from the 2016 Acquisitions.\n 41 \n\nDirect Operating Costs. Direct operating costs of $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $4.3 million or 32% from direct operating costs of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Salary costs increased by $1.6 million and $529,000 in the U.S. and Sri Lanka, respectively, as a result of MediGain acquisition. Postage and delivery costs increased by $437,000 due to the acquisition of WFS Services, Inc. Salary and other direct operating costs in Pakistan increased by $1.3 million or 34% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of additional employees in Pakistan hired to service newly acquired customers. In addition, software platform costs increased by $610,000. During the year ended December 31, 2017, salary and benefit costs for the subsidiary in Poland decreased by $148,000.\nSelling and Marketing Expense. Selling and marketing expense of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $118,000 or 10% from selling and marketing expense of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense of $11.7 million decreased by $721,000 or 6% from general and administrative expense of $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 which was primarily due to the decrease in salary cost from the MediGain acquisition due to the elimination of duplicate functions.\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $180,000 or 20% from research and development expense of $902,000 in the prior year, as a result of adding additional technical employees in Pakistan performing software development work.\nContingent Consideration. The change in contingent consideration of $151,000 and ($715,000) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, relates to the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration. The loss in 2017 resulted from an increase in the price of the Company's common stock for the shares held in escrow from the acquisition of Practicare Medical Management, Inc. in 2014. The gain in 2016 resulted primarily from changes in the revenue estimates for the acquisitions made in 2015 and the 2016 Acquisitions and also from a decrease in the price of the Company's common stock for the shares held in escrow.\nDepreciation. Depreciation of $634,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $107,000 or 20% from depreciation of $527,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of additional property and equipment purchases and the MediGain acquisition.\nAmortization Expense. Amortization expense of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased by $915,000 or 20% from amortization expense of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease is due to the intangible assets acquired in the 2014 acquisitions becoming fully amortized during 2017, net of the additional amortization related to the MediGain acquisition.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges primarily represent employee severance costs, remaining lease and termination fees, disposal of property and equipment and professional fees associated with the closing of the operations in India and Poland. There were no similar costs incurred in 2016.\n 42 \n\nInterest Income. Interest income of $17,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $19,000 or 53% from interest income of $36,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest income primarily represents late fees from customers.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $642,000 or 94% from interest expense of $682,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to additional interest costs on amounts related to the MediGain acquisition. Also, included in the 2017 interest expense is $463,000 of deferred financing costs related to the Opus credit agreement, which were written off in connection with the full repayment and termination of the loan agreement.\nOther Income (Expense) - net. Other income - net was $332,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to other expense - net of $53,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Included in other income (expense) are foreign currency transaction gains (losses) primarily resulting from transactions in foreign currencies other than the functional currency. These transaction gains and losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations related to the recurring measurement and settlement of such transactions. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2017 also includes $59,000 in cash received, net of obligations assumed, from the former owners of an acquired business in settlement of a dispute.\nIncome Tax Provision. There was a $68,000 provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $129,000 compared to the provision for income taxes of $197,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Included in the 2017 tax provision was a $26,542 deferred income tax provision related to the amortization of goodwill. The pre-tax loss decreased from $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Although the Company is forecasting a return to profitability, it incurred three years of cumulative losses which make realization of a deferred tax asset difficult to support in accordance with ASC 740. Accordingly, a valuation allowance was recorded against all deferred tax assets of $6.7 million and $7.2 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company's effective tax rate is (1.1%) and our Federal statutory tax rate is 34%. The primary reason for this difference pertains to the net operating loss incurred in the current year which could not be recorded as a benefit as the Company recorded a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets.\nThe Company has recorded goodwill as a result of its acquisitions. Goodwill is not amortized for financial reporting purposes. However, goodwill is tax deductible and therefore amortized over 15 years for tax purposes. As such, deferred income tax expense and a deferred tax liability arise as a result of the tax-deductibility of this indefinitely lived asset. The resulting deferred tax liability, which is expected to continue to increase over the amortization period, will have an indefinite life. This deferred tax liability could remain on the Company's consolidated balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment of goodwill (for financial reporting purposes) or a portion of the business is sold.\nSince the aforementioned deferred tax liability could have an indefinite life, it is not netted against the Company's deferred tax assets when determining the required valuation allowance. Doing so would result in the understatement of the valuation allowance and related deferred income tax expense.\nThe Company will maintain a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. While our plan is to be profitable in the future and begin utilizing these deferred tax assets, there is not sufficient evidence to allow us to avoid the full valuation allowance in 2016 and 2017. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and an income tax benefit for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the timing and level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve.\nThe Company has a Federal NOL carry forward of approximately $15.5 million which will expire between 2034 and 2037. The Company has state NOL carry forwards of approximately $14.7 million which will expire at various dates from 2034 to 2037.\n 43 \nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on future dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations; (5) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized; (6) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; and (7) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.\nThe Company has completed a preliminary analysis of the effects of the Tax Act on the Company and do not believe that it will have a significant impact as a result of the available Federal net operating losses available to the Company.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company had a cash balance of $4.4 million at December 31, 2017 and no outstanding amount drawn on its credit facility with SVB.\nDuring October 2017, the Company repaid and closed its Opus credit facility and replaced it with a $5 million revolving line of credit with SVB. Borrowings under the SVB facility are based on 200% of repeatable revenue, reduced by an annualized attrition rate, as defined in the agreement. The entire facility is currently available to the Company. As of December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all the covenants contained in the SVB credit agreement.\nIn October 2016 the Company made an initial $2 million payment toward the MediGain acquisition, which had a total purchase price of $7 million, and the remaining $5 million, plus interest, was paid during the third quarter of 2017.\nThe Company had a major turning point in liquidity during 2017, starting the year with $3.5 million in cash, $9.3 million of bank debt, a working capital deficit of $7.4 million and negative cash flows from operations of $889,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. In 2017, the Company generated $282,000 of positive cash flow from operations as the Company completed the integration of its 2016 Acquisitions and ended the year with $4.4 million in cash, positive working capital of $4.6 million and no bank debt. As profitability and liquidity improved during the year, the Company had fourth quarter 2017 cash flows provided by operating activities of $1.6 million, and also a net increase in cash for the quarter of $1.6 million.\nManagement achieved extensive expense reductions following the acquisition of MediGain in October 2016. The cost cutting included closing certain domestic and foreign facilities, eliminating reliance on subcontractors, and reducing non-essential personnel where work could be performed by offshore employees more cost-effectively.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years presented.\n\nIn September 2015, the Company secured a $10 million credit facility from Opus, including an $8 million term loan and a $2 million revolving line of credit. During October 2017, the credit facility with Opus was repaid and terminated, and replaced with a $5 million revolving line of credit from SVB. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts were drawn on the SVB credit line.\n 44 \nThe loss before income taxes was $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, of which $4.3 million was non-cash depreciation and amortization. Additionally, the loss included the non-cash write-off of the deferred financing costs due to the early termination of the Opus credit agreement amounting to approximately $463,000.\nDuring the year of 2017, the Company raised a total of $18.4 million in net proceeds from a series of equity financings. In May 2017, the Company completed a registered direct offering of one million shares of its common stock at $2.30 per share, raising net proceeds of approximately $2.0 million. Between June and December 2017, the Company completed six public offerings of approximately 765,000 shares of Preferred Stock at $25.00 per share, raising net proceeds of approximately $16.4 million.\nManagement continues to focus on the Company's overall profitability, including growing revenue and managing expenses, and expects that these efforts will continue to enhance our liquidity and financial position. Based on management's forecasts, the Company will have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations as they become due for the next twelve months from the date of financial statement issuance.\nCollectively, these developments dramatically improved the financial position of the Company.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $282,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to cash used in operating activities of $889,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the net loss of $3.2 million included the following changes in non-cash items: decrease in depreciation and amortization of $808,000, decrease in stock-based compensation of $391,000, net of an increase in the adjustment for contingent consideration of $867,000. Revenue increased by $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, and expenses increased by $3.9 million for the same period primarily due to the acquisition of MediGain in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAccounts receivable decreased by $42,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with an increase of $456,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Accounts payable, accrued compensation and accrued expenses decreased by $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with an increase of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $902,000, a decrease of $2.9 million compared to $3.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in spending is primarily due to only a small acquisition in 2017 for $205,000 compared to initial payments of $3.4 million for the 2016 Acquisitions.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.8 million, compared to $149,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash provided by financing activities during 2017 includes $16.5 million of net proceeds from issuing approximately 765,000 shares of preferred stock, $2.0 million raised from issuing one million shares of common stock, offset by $7.7 million of repayments for debt obligations, a $5 million payment to Prudential and $1.5 million of preferred stock dividends. Cash provided by financing activities the year ended December 31, 2016 included $2 million of additional term loan borrowings from Opus Bank before financing costs, offset by $1.4 million repayment of debt obligations, $709,000 of preferred stock dividends and $546,000 of repurchases of common stock. Average borrowings from our revolving line of credit were $660,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring October 2017, the Company replaced its Opus credit facility with a $5 million revolving line of credit from SVB. Borrowings under the credit facility are based on 200% of repeatable revenue reduced by an annualized attrition rate, as defined in the agreement. As of December 31, 2017, there were no amounts drawn on the line, and the full $5 million is currently available.\nIn connection with the common stock buy-back program, the Company purchased 644,565 of its shares for an aggregate cost of $546,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. No shares were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n 45 \nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe have contractual obligations under our line of credit and those related to contingent consideration in connection with the acquisitions made in 2015 and 2016. We also maintain operating leases for property and certain office equipment. We were in compliance with all SVB covenants in 2017.\nThe following table presents certain payments due by the Company under our long-term contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of December 31, 2017. In addition, based on the obligations as of December 31, 2017, we expected interest expense to be approximately $20,000 during the years below.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special-purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Other than our operating leases for office space, computer equipment and other property, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.", "item_7_tables": "Table 61: <table> <tr> <td>

"summary": " Here is a summary of the key points from the MD&A report:\n\nRevenue and Profitability\n- Total revenue in 2017 was $31.8 million, a 30% increase from 2016, largely due to the acquisition of MediGain in late 2016. \n- Net loss in 2017 was $5.6 million compared to $8.8 million in 2016. The reduced loss was partly due to cost reductions after the MediGain acquisition.\n- Adjusted EBITDA turned positive to $2.3 million in 2017 compared to negative $0.6 million in 2016.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- Cash balance improved to $4.4 million at end of 2017 from $3.5 million at beginning of year. Paid off bank debt.\n- Completed several equity financings in 2017, raising $18.4 million in net proceeds.\n- Ended year with positive working capital of $4.6 million compared to a deficit at beginning of year.\n- Replaced credit facility with new $5 million revolving line of credit from SVB that currently has no amounts drawn.\n\nOutlook\n- Management achieved extensive cost reductions in 2017 while growing revenue. Expects these efforts to continue improving profitability and liquidity going forward.\n- With forecasts and equity financings, believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet obligations for next 12 months.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions on the summary."}
