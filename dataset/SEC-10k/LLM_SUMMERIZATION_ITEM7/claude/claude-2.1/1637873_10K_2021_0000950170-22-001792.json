This discussion, particularly information with respect to our future results of operations or financial condition, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as described under the heading Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should review the disclosure under the heading Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Final Prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) on March 24, 2021.\nOverview\nOur mission is to build and enable the most trusted and efficient digital marketplace for buying and selling used vehicles with transparency and comprehensive data that was previously unimaginable.\nWe provide a highly efficient and vibrant digital marketplace for wholesale vehicle transactions and data services that offer transparent and accurate vehicle information to our customers. Our platform leverages data insights and technology to power our digital marketplace and data services, enabling our dealers and commercial partners to buy, sell, and value vehicles with confidence and efficiency. We strive to solve the challenges that the used automotive industry has faced for generations and provide powerful technology-enabled capabilities to our dealers and commercial partners who fulfill a critical role in the automotive ecosystem. We help dealers source and manage inventory and accurately price their vehicles as well as process payments, transfer titles, manage arbitrations, and finance and transport vehicles. Our platform encompasses:\n\u2022Digital Marketplace. Connects buyers and sellers of wholesale vehicles in an intuitive and efficient manner. Our core marketplace offering is a 20-minute live auction, which facilitates instant transactions of wholesale vehicles, and is available across multiple platforms including mobile apps, desktop, and directly through API integration. We also offer transportation and financing services to facilitate the entire transaction journey.\n\u2022Data Services. Offer insights into the condition and value of used vehicles for transactions both on and off our marketplace and help dealers, their end consumers, and commercial partners make more informed decisions and transact with confidence and efficiency. We enable dealers to manage their inventory and set pricing more effectively while turning vehicles faster and maximizing profit by leveraging predictive analytics informed by machine learning and market data.\n\u2022Data and Technology. Underpins everything we do, and powers our vehicle inspections, comprehensive vehicle intelligence reports, digital marketplace, inventory management software, and operations automation.\nWe have historically generated the majority of our revenue from our digital marketplace where we earn auction and ancillary fees from both buyers and sellers in each case only upon a successful auction. Buyer auction fees are variable based on the price of the vehicle, while seller auction fees include a fixed auction fee and an optional fee for the elective condition report associated with the vehicle. We also earn ancillary fees through additional value-added services to buyers and sellers in connection with the auction.\nOur customers include participants on our marketplace and purchasers of our data services. Certain dealers and commercial partners purchase data services in connection with vehicle assessments, software subscriptions, and transactions that do not occur on our marketplace. Our dealer customers include a majority of the top 100 used vehicle dealers in the United States.\nWe had 560,959 and 391,466 Marketplace Units sold on our marketplace, representing a total Marketplace Gross Merchandise Value, or Marketplace GMV, of $7.9 billion and $3.3 billion, for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we generated revenue of $358.4 million and $208.4 million, net loss of $78.2 million and $41.0 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $(44.1) million and $(30.8) million, respectively. We continue to invest in growth to scale our company responsibly and drive towards sustained profitability. See the section titled -Key Operating and Financial Metrics\u201d for additional information on Marketplace Units, Marketplace GMV and Adjusted EBITDA.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business\nBeginning in March 2020, our business and operations began to experience the effects of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, COVID-19 significantly disrupted the operations of our customers, most of whom are automotive dealers who sell both new and used vehicles to consumers in physical dealership stores. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate instituted shelter-in-place orders, forcing many physical automotive dealership stores to close in March and April and cutting off consumer foot traffic, which led to a decline in overall vehicle sales to consumers.\nThe slowdown in the retail sales of used vehicles subsequently impacted the market for wholesale automotive transactions. Wholesale is one of the most common supply sources through which dealers acquire used vehicle inventory to sell retail. With a sudden decline in retail sales of these dealerships, dealers' demand for wholesale transactions also decreased sharply. In addition, most automotive wholesale transactions in the United States are conducted through physical or hybrid auctions that still require physical operations, and shelter-in-place orders forced these traditional auctions to temporarily shut down operations.\nNegative trends in transaction volume driven by COVID began to be observed near the end of the first quarter of 2020. For the month ended March 31, 2020, our Marketplace Units decreased 20% month-over-month. This decline accelerated early in the second quarter; in the month ended April 30, 2020, Marketplace Units were down approximately 29% month-over-month. In addition to declining transaction volumes, because supply of wholesale vehicles exceeded the market demand during these months, we saw the average sales price per unit decline by over 31% from the month ended February 29, 2020 to the month ended April 30, 2020.\nThis initial disruption began to subside in May 2020 as the demand for used vehicles on a national level began to outpace supply, leading to higher used vehicle valuations and a higher percentage of successful auctions on our marketplace. Moreover, an increasing number of dealers and commercial partners looked to a fully digital marketplace to transact remotely as traditional, in-person wholesale auctions continued to experience COVID-19-related disruptions and faced challenges in restoring normal operations.\nAs a result, starting in May 2020, our marketplace activity rebounded strongly to reach levels higher than the months of January and February 2020 prior to the impact of COVID-19. For the month ended May 31, 2020, both our Marketplace Units and our revenue approximately doubled compared to the month ended April 30, 2020. Driven by both higher demand for used vehicles leading to less discounting and increased overall valuations, the average sale price of our Marketplace Unit, and subsequently our auction revenue per unit, also increased starting in May 2020 and reached peak levels in August 2020. As supply constraints began to ease and the demand and supply for used vehicles reached a better equilibrium in the fourth quarter of 2020, the growth in our transaction volume and revenue normalized.\nInto 2021, the supply and demand in our Marketplace continued to be impacted by the semiconductor supply shortage and COVID-related production disruptions. These factors continue to limit the supply of new vehicles and contribute to short term volatility in used vehicle sales, including those on our Marketplace. New car supply has had\na significant impact on the supply of wholesale vehicles available within our Marketplace over the period, particularly through the fourth quarter of 2021 as dealer inventories reached historic lows.\nWe are continuing to monitor the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and industry. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact our business, and the broader implications of the pandemic on our sustained results of operations, remain uncertain.\nWe cannot predict how the pandemic will continue to develop, whether and to what extent government regulations or other restrictions may impact our operations or those of our customers, or whether and to what extent the pandemic or the effects thereof may have longer term unanticipated impacts on our business.\nKey Operating and Financial Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of operating and financial metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance. Our business metrics may be calculated in a manner different than similar business metrics used by other companies.\nTable 7: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketplace Units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>560,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>391,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketplace GMV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9 billion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3 billion\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketplace Buyers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketplace Sellers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44.1) million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.8) million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMarketplace Units\nMarketplace Units is a key indicator of our potential for growth in Marketplace GMV and revenue. It demonstrates the overall engagement of our customers on the ACV platform, the vibrancy of our digital marketplace and our market share of wholesale transactions in the United States. We define Marketplace Units as the number of vehicles transacted on our marketplace within the applicable period. Marketplace Units transacted includes any vehicle that successfully reaches sold status, even if the auction is subsequently unwound, meaning the buyer or seller does not complete the transaction. These instances have been immaterial to date. Marketplace Units exclude vehicles that were inspected by ACV, but not sold on our digital marketplace. Marketplace Units have increased over time as we have expanded our territory coverage, added new Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers to our platform and increased our share of wholesale transactions from existing customers. Because we only earn auction and ancillary fees in the case of a successful auction, Marketplace Units will remain a critical driver of our revenue growth.\nMarketplace GMV\nMarketplace GMV is primarily driven by the volume and dollar value of Marketplace Units transacted on our digital marketplace. We believe that Marketplace GMV acts as an indicator of the success of our marketplace, signaling satisfaction of dealers and buyers on our marketplace, and the health, scale, and growth of our business. We define Marketplace GMV as the total dollar value of vehicles transacted through our digital marketplace within the applicable period, excluding any auction and ancillary fees. Because our definition of Marketplace Units does not include vehicles inspected but not sold on our digital marketplace, GMV does not represent revenue earned by us. We expect that Marketplace GMV will continue to grow as Marketplace Units grow, though at a varying rate within a given applicable period, as Marketplace GMV is also impacted by the value of each vehicle transacted. Due to the historically high values of used automobiles in the current environment, it is possible that as values normalize in the future, Marketplace GMV could decline even as Marketplace Units grow.\nMarketplace Buyers\nWe define Marketplace Buyers as dealers or commercial partners with a unique customer ID that have transacted at least once in the last 12 months as a buyer on our digital marketplace. Marketplace Buyers include independent and franchise dealers buying on our marketplace.\nMarketplace Sellers\nWe define Marketplace Sellers as dealers or commercial partners with a unique customer ID that have transacted at least once in the last 12 months as a seller on our digital marketplace. Marketplace Sellers include independent and franchise dealers selling on our marketplace, as well as commercial partners, consisting of commercial leasing companies, rental car companies, bank or other finance companies, who use our marketplace to sell their inventory.\nWe monitor the growth in both Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers as they each promote a more vibrant and healthy marketplace. We believe that our growth in Marketplace Sellers and Marketplace Buyers over time has been driven by the value proposition of our offerings, and our sales and marketing success, including our ability to attract new dealers and commercial partners to our digital marketplace. Based on our current position in the market, we believe that we have significant opportunity to continue to increase the number of Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we use to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, interest (income) expense, other (income) expense, net, provision for income taxes, and other one-time, non-recurring items, when applicable. We monitor Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure to supplement the financial information we present in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results. For further explanation of the uses and limitations of this measure and a reconciliation of our Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss), please see -Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nWe expect Adjusted EBITDA to fluctuate in the near term as we continue to invest in our business and improve over the long term as we achieve greater scale in our business and efficiencies in our operating expenses.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe that the growth and future success of our business depend on many factors. While each of these factors presents significant opportunities for our business, they also pose important challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain our growth, improve our results of operations, and increase profitability.\nIncreasing Marketplace Units\nIncreasing Marketplace Units is a key driver of our revenue growth. The transparency, efficiency and vibrancy of our marketplace is critical to our ability to grow our share of wholesale transactions from existing customers and attract new buyers and sellers to our digital marketplace. Failure to increase the number of Marketplace Units would adversely affect our revenue growth, operating results, and the overall health of our marketplace.\nGrow Our Share of Wholesale Transactions from Existing Customers\nOur success depends in part on our ability to grow our share of wholesale transactions from existing customers, increasing their engagement and spend on our platform. We remain in the early stages of penetrating our Marketplace Buyers and Sellers' total number of wholesale transactions. As we continue to invest in eliminating key risks of uncertainty related to the auction process through our trusted and efficient digital marketplace, we expect\nthat we will capture an increasing share of transactions from our existing buyers and sellers. Our ability to increase share from existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including our customers' satisfaction with our platform, competition, pricing and overall changes in our customers' engagement levels.\nAdd New Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers\nWe believe we have a significant opportunity to add new marketplace participants. As we expand our presence within our existing territories, we are able to drive increased liquidity and greater vehicle selection, which in turn improves our ability to attract new Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers. Additionally, we intend to add more commercial consignors to our digital marketplace and capture a greater share of vehicles in the wholesale market that are sold to dealers by commercial consignors through auctions and private sales.\nOur ability to attract new Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers will depend on a number of factors including: the ability of our sales team to onboard dealers and commercial consignors onto our platform and ensure their satisfaction, the ability of our territory managers to build awareness of our brand, the ability of our vehicle condition inspectors, or VCIs, to cultivate relationships with our customers in their respective territories, and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.\nGrow Awareness for Our Offerings and Brand\nWholesale vehicle online penetration is just beginning, lagging the consumer automotive market, and we expect more dealers and commercial partners to source and manage their inventory online. As the digitization of the wholesale automotive market accelerates, we believe that our digital marketplace is well positioned to capture a disproportionate share of that growth. We plan to use targeted sales and marketing efforts to educate potential Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers as to the benefits of our offerings and drive adoption of our platform. Our ability to grow awareness of our offerings and brand depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022Secure Trusted Supply. The more trusted supply on our marketplace, the more buyers we can attract to our platform.\n\u2022Deepen Relationships with Dealers and Commercial Partners. We have a team of VCIs who work on our customers' lots to not only provide inspection services, but also to develop strong client relationships and ensure the highest quality service.\n\u2022Drive Customer Loyalty. Our loyal customers and referrals serve as a highly effective customer acquisition tool, and help drive our growth in a given territory.\n\u2022Grow Brand Awareness. We plan to invest in promoting our brand by targeted marketing spend and increase customer awareness in the territories in which we operate.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to successfully grow our market presence and market and sell existing and new products to both new and existing customers.\nGrow Value-Added and Data Services\nWe plan to continue to drive customer adoption of our existing value-added and data services and introduce new and complementary products. Our ability to drive higher attachment rates of existing value-added services, such as ACV Transportation and ACV Capital, will help grow our revenue. In 2019 we launched our financing arm, ACV Capital. In 2021 we added MAX Digital's flagship inventory management system to our portfolio of data services offerings. We plan to drive customer adoption of our data services such as our True360 Reports that bring transparency and offer insights into the condition and value of used vehicles as well as our inventory management system which enables dealers to accurately price wholesale and retail inventory while maximizing profit by leveraging predictive analytics informed by machine learning. These data services enable our customers to make more informed inventory management decisions both on and off our digital marketplace. In addition, we will continue to focus on developing new products and services that enhance our platform in areas including new data-powered products. Our ability to drive customer adoption of these products and services is dependent on the pricing of our products, the offerings of our competitors and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.\nInvestment in Growth\nWe are actively investing in our business. In order to support our future growth and expanded product offerings, we expect this investment to continue. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase as we continue to build our sales and marketing efforts, expand our employee base and invest in our technology development. The investments we make in our platform are designed to grow our revenue opportunity and to improve our operating results in the long term, but these investments could also delay our ability to achieve profitability or reduce our profitability in the near term. Our success is dependent on making value-generative investments that support our future growth.\nUsed Car Demand\nOur success depends in part on sufficient demand for used vehicles. Our recent growth over the last several years has coincided with a rising consumer demand for used vehicles. More recently, since early 2020, the demand for vehicles has outpaced supply as automotive manufacturers respond to the semiconductor supply shortage that continues to limit the supply of new automotive vehicles and contribute to short term volatility in used vehicle sales, including those on our Marketplace. We have seen new car supply have a significant impact on the supply of wholesale vehicles available within our Marketplace over this period, particularly through the fourth quarter of 2021 as dealer inventories have reached historic lows.\nUsed vehicle sales are also seasonal. Sales typically peak late in the first calendar quarter and early in the second quarter, with the lowest relative level of industry vehicle sales occurring in the fourth calendar quarter. Due to our rapid growth since launch, our sales patterns to date have not been entirely reflective of the general seasonality of the used vehicle market, but we expect this to normalize as our business matures. Seasonality also impacts used vehicle pricing, with used vehicles depreciating at a faster rate in the last two quarters of each year and a slower rate in the first two quarters of each year. We may experience seasonal and other fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations, which may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. See the section titled -Seasonality\u201d for additional information on the impacts of seasonality on our business.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nMarketplace and Service Revenue\nWe have historically generated the majority of our revenue from our digital marketplace where we earn auction and ancillary fees from both buyers and sellers, in each case only upon a successful auction. Our marketplace and service revenue consists principally of revenue earned from facilitating auctions and arranging for the transportation of vehicles purchased in such auctions.\nWe act as an agent when facilitating a vehicle auction through the marketplace. Auction and related fees charged to the buyer and seller are reported as revenue on a net basis, excluding the price of the auctioned vehicle in the transaction.\nWe act as a principal when arranging for the transportation of vehicles purchased on the marketplace and leverage our network of third-party transportation carriers to secure the arrangement. Transportation fees charged to the buyer are reported on a gross basis.\nWe also generate data services revenue through our True360 reports and MAX Digital inventory management software subscriptions and offer short-term inventory financing to eligible customers purchasing vehicles through the marketplace.\nCustomer Assurance Revenue\nWe also generate revenue by providing our Go Green assurance to sellers on the condition of certain vehicles sold on the marketplace, which is considered a guarantee under GAAP. This assurance option is only available for\nsellers who have enrolled in the service on qualifying vehicles for which we have prepared the vehicle condition report. Customer assurance revenue also includes revenue from other price guarantee products offered to sellers. Customer assurance revenue is measured based upon the fair value of the Go Green assurance that we provide. We expect the fair value per vehicle assured to decrease over time as we continue to improve the quality of our inspection product, which in turn reduces the costs of satisfying such assurance.\nOperating Expenses\nMarketplace and Service Cost of Revenue\nMarketplace and service cost of revenue consists of third-party transportation carrier costs, titles shipping costs, customer support, website hosting costs, inspection costs related to data services and various other costs. These costs include salaries, benefits, bonuses and related stock-based compensation expenses, which we refer to as personnel expenses. We expect our marketplace and service cost of revenue to continue to increase as we continue to scale our business and introduce new product and service offerings.\nCustomer Assurance Cost of Revenue\nCustomer assurance cost of revenue consists of the costs related to satisfying claims against the vehicle condition guarantees, and other price guarantees. We expect that our customer assurance cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows, particularly as we provide guarantees on an increasing number of vehicles.\nOperations and Technology\nOperations and technology expense consists of costs for wholesale auction inspections, personnel costs related to payments and titles processing, transportation processing, product and engineering and other general operations and technology expenses. These costs include personnel-related expenses and other allocated facility and office costs. We expect that our operations and technology expense will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows, particularly as we incur additional costs related to continued investments in our marketplace, transportation capabilities and other technologies.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expense consists of costs resulting from sales, accounting, finance, legal, marketing, human resources, executive, and other administrative activities. These costs include personnel-related expenses, legal and other professional services expenses and other allocated facility and office costs. Also included in selling, general and administrative expense is advertising and marketing costs to promote our services. We expect that our selling, general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. However, we expect that our selling, general and administrative expense will decrease as a percentage of our revenue as our revenue grows over the longer term.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation of fixed assets, and amortization of acquired intangible assets and internal-use software.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and interest expense on our borrowings.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists of U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our Consolidated Statements of Operations data for the periods presented:\nTable 8: <table> <tr>

The increase of $135.3 million, or 78%, was primarily driven by an increase in auction marketplace revenue from our buyers and sellers, as well as an increase in revenue earned\nfrom arranging for the transportation of vehicles to buyers, data and other service revenue. Revenue increases in the current year were primarily volume-driven and correlate to per unit GMV, which rose due to the increase in demand for used vehicles on a national level, leading to higher buyer revenue per unit. Additionally, we raised the buyer fees charged on our marketplace effective in December 2021 that further contributed to the increase in revenue year-over-year, and specifically within the fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2021, auction marketplace revenue increased to $164.3 million from $99.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, and transportation, data and other services revenue increased to $144.1 million from $73.9 million.\nCustomer Assurance Revenue\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Customer assurance revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCustomer assurance revenue was $50.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, Go Green assurance revenue increased to $45.4 million from $32.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenue increases were primarily volume-driven as a result of the expansion of our marketplace platform across the United States and a deeper penetration of markets where we do business, and were partially offset by a decline in the fair value of the Go Green assurance offering.\nOperating Expenses\nMarketplace and Service Cost of Revenue\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketplace and service cost of revenue (excluding\ndepreciation & amortization)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMarketplace and service cost of revenue was $159.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $83.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

However, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, provides investors with additional useful information in evaluating our performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, when taken together with our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance and facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations or outlook. In particular, we believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA is helpful to our investors as it is a measure used by management in assessing the health of our business and evaluating our operating performance, as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes.\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations include that: (i) it does not properly reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future; (ii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect these capital expenditures; (iii) it does not consider the impact of stock-based compensation expense; (iv) it does not reflect other non-operating expenses, including interest expense; (v) it does not consider the impact of any contingent consideration liability valuation adjustments; and (vi) it does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us. In addition, our use of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, when evaluating our performance, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial measures, including our net loss and other results stated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(78,182\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(41,021\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest (income) expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(115\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>489\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,054\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(44,137\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(30,752\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed operations since our inception primarily through our marketplace revenue, borrowings under our debt facilities and the net proceeds we have received from sales of equity securities as further detailed below. In March 2021, we completed our IPO which resulted in aggregate net proceeds of $388.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $566.0 million, and investments in marketable securities totaling $13.8 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months and for the long-term. Our future capital requirements over the long-term will depend on many factors, including volume of sales with existing customers, expansion of sales and marketing activities to acquire new customers, timing and extent of spending to support development efforts and introduction of new and enhanced services. We may, in the future, enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, and technologies. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that we require additional financing, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our principal commitments primarily consist of long-term debt and leases for office space. We have $1.4 million of lease obligations due within a year, and an additional $2.1 million of lease obligations due at various dates through 2027. Refer to Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nIn order to compete successfully and sustain operations at current levels over the next 12 months, we will be required to devote a significant amount of operating cash flow to our human capital in the form of salaries and wages. Additionally, we enter into purchase commitments for goods and services made in the ordinary course of business. These purchase commitments include goods and services received and recorded as liabilities as of\nDecember 31, 2021 as well goods and services which have not yet been delivered or performed and have, therefore, not been reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations. These commitments typically become due after the delivery and completion of such goods or services.\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity to date, we plan to continue to evaluate aspects of our spending, including capital expenditures, discretionary spending, and strategic investments in 2022. We have considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our liquidity and capital resources to date, and we do not currently expect it to impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs or affect our ability to comply with debt covenants. We believe we are well-positioned to manage our business and have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet our cash requirements using available cash and equivalents, investments in marketable securities, and borrowing under our revolving credit facilities.\nA substantial amount of our working capital is generated from the payments received for services which we provide. We settle transactions among buyers and sellers using the marketplace, and as a result the value of the vehicles passes through our balance sheet. Because our receivables typically have been, on average, settled faster than our payables, our cash position at each balance sheet date has been bolstered by marketplace float. Changes in working capital vary from quarter-to-quarter as a result of GMV and the timing of collections and disbursements of funds related to auctions held near period end.\nOur Debt Arrangements\nWe currently have a revolving credit facility with Credit Suisse AG, New York Branch, or the 2019 Revolver, which we entered into in December 2019. We entered into an amendment to the 2019 Revolver on June 25, 2021. We also entered into a revolving credit facility with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., or the 2021 Revolver, on August 24, 2021.\nOne of our wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries, ACV Capital Funding LLC, is the borrower under the 2019 Revolver, which provides for a revolving line of credit in the aggregate amount of up to $50.0 million, with borrowing availability subject to a borrowing base calculated as a percentage of ACV Capital Funding LLC's eligible receivables. The 2019 Revolver is secured by the borrowing base of eligible receivables. In addition, we entered into a separate indemnity agreement in connection with the 2019 Revolver under which we provided an unsecured guaranty of (a) 10% of the outstanding loans under the 2019 Revolver at the time of any event of default and (b) any losses, damages or other expenses incurred by the lenders under the 2019 Revolver, payable in the event of certain specified acts by ACV Capital Funding LLC. The interest rate on any outstanding borrowings is at LIBOR plus 3.75%, subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, and interest payments are payable monthly. The 2019 Revolver has a maturity date of June 25, 2024. The 2019 Revolver also contains customary covenants that limit ACV Capital Funding LLC's ability to enter into indebtedness, make distributions and make investments, among other restrictions. The 2019 Revolver contains a liquidity covenant based on cash on hand, a tangible net worth covenant based on ACV Capital's consolidated net worth, a tangible net worth covenant based on our consolidated net worth, a leverage covenant based on our consolidated leverage and certain other financial covenants tied to ACV Capital's eligible receivables.\nWe are the borrower under the 2021 Revolver, which provides for a revolving line of credit in the aggregate principal amount of up to $160.0 million. The 2021 Revolver also includes a sub facility that provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to $20.0 million outstanding at any time. The 2021 Revolver is guaranteed by substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of our and such subsidiaries' assets. The interest rate applicable to the 2021 Revolver is, at our option, either (a) LIBOR (or a replacement rate established in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement for the 2021 Revolver) (subject to a 0.00% LIBOR floor), plus a margin of 2.75% per annum or (b) the Alternate Base Rate plus a margin of 1.75% per annum. The Alternate Base Rate is the highest of (a) the Wall Street Journal prime rate, (b) the NYFRB rate plus 0.5% and (c)(i) 1.00% plus (ii) the adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period. The 2021 Revolver has a maturity date of August 24, 2026. The 2021 Revolver contains customary covenants that limit our ability to enter into indebtedness, make distributions and make investments, among other restrictions. The 2021 Revolver also contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum liquidity level and achieve specified trailing four quarter revenue targets.\nWe were in compliance with all such applicable covenants as of December 31, 2021, and believe we are in compliance as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2021, we had $0.5 million drawn under the 2019 Revolver, and there was an outstanding letter of credit issued under the 2021 Revolver in the amount of $1.1 million. There were no other amounts outstanding under the 2021 Revolver.\nCash Flows from Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented:\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(129,266\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,673\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net increase in cash and equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>332,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash is cash collection from fees earned on our marketplace services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel expenses, marketing expenses and overhead expenses.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities of $85.3 million was primarily related to our net loss of $78.2 million, adjusted for net cash inflows of $125.9 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, and for non-cash charges of $37.6 million. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, and provision for bad debt. The change in operating assets and liabilities were the result of a $120.2 million increase in accounts receivable and $2.7 million increase in other operating assets, which were offset by a $242.9 million increase in accounts payable and a $5.8 million increase in other current and non-current liabilities.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities of $10.4 million was primarily related to our net loss of $41.0 million, adjusted for net cash inflows $35.4 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, and for non-cash charges of $16.0 million. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, and provision for bad debt, partially offset by contingent gains. The change in operating assets and liabilities were the result of a $29.2 million increase in accounts receivable and $6.4 million increase in other operating assets, which were offset by a $66.2 million increase in accounts payable and a $4.8 million increase in other current and non-current liabilities.\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 relative to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by an increase in marketplace float of $119.2 million. Marketplace float exists when our receivables from Marketplace Buyers are settled faster than our payables to Marketplace Sellers, thereby bolstering our cash flows from operating activities.\nInvesting Activities\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $129.3 million and $19.7 million, respectively, primarily related to capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment to support field and site operations, along with capitalized software development costs to support continued technology innovation, increases in finance receivables, and the use of cash for the acquisition of businesses.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 relative to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by an additional $59.0 million investments in acquisition of businesses in 2021, additional $31.7 million increase in finance receivables, and $13.8 million of investments made in marketable securities.\nFinancing Activities\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $376.2 million and was primarily the result of proceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to the IPO, which were offset by net repayments of long term debt during the period, payments for debt issuance and other financing costs, and the payment of RSU tax withholdings in exchange for shares of common stock surrendered by RSU holders.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $60.8 million and was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of Series E-1 preferred stock and net proceeds from long term debt.\nAcquisitions\nIn the second quarter of 2020, we acquired certain assets from ASI Services LLC, or ASI, for a total purchase consideration of $11.2 million. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method. ASI, headquartered in Cincinnati, OH, was a privately held corporation that primarily focused on providing inspection services for off-lease vehicles to financial institutions. The acquisition of ASI enabled us to expand our position in the used vehicle industry and enhance our service offerings with dealers and commercial partners.\nIn the third quarter of 2021, we completed an acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Max Digital LLC, or Max Digital, for approximately $61.4 million. The total purchase price was paid in cash. The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, the results of the acquired business have been included in our results of operations from the acquisition date. In connection with the acquisition, we incurred approximately $1.1 million of transaction costs. The acquisition of Max Digital enabled us to expand our position in the used vehicle industry and enhance our service offerings with dealers and commercial partners.\nAlso during 2021, we completed other business combinations for total consideration of approximately $6.9 million, net of cash acquired. The transactions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, the results of the acquired business have been included in our results of operations from the respective acquisition dates. These acquisitions enabled us to expand our position in the used vehicle industry and enhance our service offerings between dealers and commercial partners.\nSeasonality\nThe volume of vehicles sold through our auctions generally fluctuates from quarter to quarter. This seasonality is caused by several factors, including holidays, weather, the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles and the timing of federal tax returns, which affects the demand side of the auction industry. As a result, revenue and operating expenses related to volume will fluctuate accordingly on a quarterly basis. In the fourth quarter, we typically experience lower used vehicle auction volume as well as additional costs associated with the holidays. Seasonally depressed used vehicle auction volume typically continues during the winter months through the first quarter. Typical seasonality trends may not be observed in periods where other external factors more significantly impact the industry.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe believe that the following accounting policies involve a high degree of judgement and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our other significant accounting policies. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in those financial statements and accompanying notes. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. Determining whether performance obligations should be accounted for separately or combined may require significant judgment. For each performance obligation within a contract, we evaluate whether we act as the principal or as an agent. When we act as the principal, revenue is recognized in the gross amount of the consideration received from the customer recognized at the point in time the services are completed. When we act as the agent, revenue is recognized net of the consideration due to a third party at the point in time when the services are provided.\nIn contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation proportionately based on the estimated stand-alone selling price, or SSP, of each performance obligation. We use an observable price to determine the SSP for each performance obligation. Where observable prices are not available, an expected cost-plus margin approach is used. We then determine how the services are transferred to the customer to determine the timing of revenue recognition.\nFrom time to time we provide promotions and incentives to buyers and sellers in various forms including discounts on fees, credits and rebates. Promotions and incentives which are consideration payable to a customer are recognized as a reduction of revenue when revenue is recognized.\nCommissions paid to sales representatives and related payroll taxes are considered costs to obtain a contract. Financial Accounting Standard Board Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 340, Other Assets and Deferred Costs, requires costs to obtain a contract with a customer within the scope of Accounting Standards Update No. 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, to be capitalized and amortized over the period of benefit. We have elected the practical expedient available under ASC 340-40-25-4 to immediately expense the incremental cost of obtaining a contract when the underlying related asset would have been amortized over one year or less.\nWe have utilized the practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-50-14 and do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.\nGeneral Guarantees\nWe provide certain guarantees to Sellers in the Marketplace in the ordinary course of business, which are accounted for under ASC 460 as a general guarantee.\nVehicle Condition Guarantees-We offer guarantees to sellers in qualifying situations where we performed a vehicle inspection and prepared the vehicle condition report. The guarantee provides us with the right to retain proceeds from the subsequent liquidation of the vehicle covered under the guarantee. The fair value of vehicle condition guarantees issued is estimated based on historical results and other qualitative factors. The vehicle condition guarantee revenue is recognized on the earlier of the guarantee expiration date or the guarantee settlement date.\nOther Price Guarantees-We provide sellers with a price guarantee for vehicles to be sold on the Marketplace from time to time. If a vehicle sells below the guaranteed price, then we are responsible for paying the Seller the difference between the guaranteed price and the final sale price. The term of the guarantee is typically less than one week.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe use the fair value recognition provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. The estimated fair value of each common stock option award is calculated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Application of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires significant judgment, and involves the use of subjective assumptions including:\n\u2022Expected Term-The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. As we do not have sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term of the stock option awards granted, the simplified method was used to determine the expected term for awards issued to employees.\n\u2022Risk-Free Interest Rate-The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury constant maturity notes with terms approximately equal to the stock-based awards' expected term.\n\u2022Expected Volatility-Since we are newly public and do not have a trading history of common stock, the expected volatility is derived from the average historical stock volatilities of the common stock of several public companies considered to be comparable to us over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock-based awards.\n\u2022Dividend Rate-The expected dividend rate is zero as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.\n\u2022Fair Value of Common Stock-Prior to the IPO, we estimated the fair value of common stock. Our board of directors, with input from management, considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock at each meeting in which award were approved. Subsequent to the IPO, the fair value of the underlying common stock is determined by the closing price, on the date of grant, of the Company's Class A common stock, which is traded publicly on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nWe measure all stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees, directors, consultants and other nonemployees based on the fair value on the date of the grant. The options vest based on a graded scale over the stated vesting period, and compensation expense is recognized based on their grant date fair value on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\nThe fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are determined based on the estimated market price of our common stock on the grant date. The awards and units vest over time and compensation expense is recognized based on their grant fair value ratably over the requisite service period.\nWe classify stock-based compensation expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same way the payroll costs or service payments are classified for the related stock-based award recipient.\nInternal-Use Software Costs\nWe capitalize internal-use software costs during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. This software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, generally three years. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, or more frequently when warranted.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives. We evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is subject to an impairment test.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as one singular reporting unit on October 1 or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our policy is to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely or not that the reporting unit's carrying value is less than its fair value, indicating the potential for goodwill impairment. If the reporting unit fails the qualitative test, then we proceed with a quantitative test. We then determine whether the reporting unit fair value\nis less than its carrying amount, and if it is, we recognize a goodwill impairment equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period under the JOBS Act for the adoption of certain accounting standards until the earlier of the date we (1) are no longer an emerging growth company or (2) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Our platform leverages data insights and technology to power our digital marketplace and data services, enabling our dealers and commercial partners to buy, sell, and value vehicles with confidence and efficiency. We strive to solve the challenges that the used automotive industry has faced for generations and provide powerful technology-enabled capabilities to our dealers and commercial partners who fulfill a critical role in the automotive ecosystem. We help dealers source and manage inventory and accurately price their vehicles as well as process payments, transfer titles, manage arbitrations, and finance and transport vehicles. Our platform encompasses:\n\u2022Digital Marketplace. Connects buyers and sellers of wholesale vehicles in an intuitive and efficient manner. Our core marketplace offering is a 20-minute live auction, which facilitates instant transactions of wholesale vehicles, and is available across multiple platforms including mobile apps, desktop, and directly through API integration. We also offer transportation and financing services to facilitate the entire transaction journey.\n\u2022Data Services. Offer insights into the condition and value of used vehicles for transactions both on and off our marketplace and help dealers, their end consumers, and commercial partners make more informed decisions and transact with confidence and efficiency. We enable dealers to manage their inventory and set pricing more effectively while turning vehicles faster and maximizing profit by leveraging predictive analytics informed by machine learning and market data.\n\u2022Data and Technology. Underpins everything we do, and powers our vehicle inspections, comprehensive vehicle intelligence reports, digital marketplace, inventory management software, and operations automation.\nWe have historically generated the majority of our revenue from our digital marketplace where we earn auction and ancillary fees from both buyers and sellers in each case only upon a successful auction. Buyer auction fees are variable based on the price of the vehicle, while seller auction fees include a fixed auction fee and an optional fee for the elective condition report associated with the vehicle. We also earn ancillary fees through additional value-added services to buyers and sellers in connection with the auction.\nOur customers include participants on our marketplace and purchasers of our data services. Certain dealers and commercial partners purchase data services in connection with vehicle assessments, software subscriptions, and transactions that do not occur on our marketplace. Our dealer customers include a majority of the top 100 used vehicle dealers in the United States.\nWe had 560,959 and 391,466 Marketplace Units sold on our marketplace, representing a total Marketplace Gross Merchandise Value, or Marketplace GMV, of $7.9 billion and $3.3 billion, for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we generated revenue of $358.4 million and $208.4 million, net loss of $78.2 million and $41.0 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $(44.1) million and $(30.8) million, respectively. We continue to invest in growth to scale our company responsibly and drive towards sustained profitability. See the section titled -Key Operating and Financial Metrics\u201d for additional information on Marketplace Units, Marketplace GMV and Adjusted EBITDA.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business\nBeginning in March 2020, our business and operations began to experience the effects of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, COVID-19 significantly disrupted the operations of our customers, most of whom are automotive dealers who sell both new and used vehicles to consumers in physical dealership stores. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate instituted shelter-in-place orders, forcing many physical automotive dealership stores to close in March and April and cutting off consumer foot traffic, which led to a decline in overall vehicle sales to consumers.\nThe slowdown in the retail sales of used vehicles subsequently impacted the market for wholesale automotive transactions. Wholesale is one of the most common supply sources through which dealers acquire used vehicle inventory to sell retail. With a sudden decline in retail sales of these dealerships, dealers' demand for wholesale transactions also decreased sharply. In addition, most automotive wholesale transactions in the United States are conducted through physical or hybrid auctions that still require physical operations, and shelter-in-place orders forced these traditional auctions to temporarily shut down operations.\nNegative trends in transaction volume driven by COVID began to be observed near the end of the first quarter of 2020. For the month ended March 31, 2020, our Marketplace Units decreased 20% month-over-month. This decline accelerated early in the second quarter; in the month ended April 30, 2020, Marketplace Units were down approximately 29% month-over-month. In addition to declining transaction volumes, because supply of wholesale vehicles exceeded the market demand during these months, we saw the average sales price per unit decline by over 31% from the month ended February 29, 2020 to the month ended April 30, 2020.\nThis initial disruption began to subside in May 2020 as the demand for used vehicles on a national level began to outpace supply, leading to higher used vehicle valuations and a higher percentage of successful auctions on our marketplace. Moreover, an increasing number of dealers and commercial partners looked to a fully digital marketplace to transact remotely as traditional, in-person wholesale auctions continued to experience COVID-19-related disruptions and faced challenges in restoring normal operations.\nAs a result, starting in May 2020, our marketplace activity rebounded strongly to reach levels higher than the months of January and February 2020 prior to the impact of COVID-19. For the month ended May 31, 2020, both our Marketplace Units and our revenue approximately doubled compared to the month ended April 30, 2020. Driven by both higher demand for used vehicles leading to less discounting and increased overall valuations, the average sale price of our Marketplace Unit, and subsequently our auction revenue per unit, also increased starting in May 2020 and reached peak levels in August 2020. As supply constraints began to ease and the demand and supply for used vehicles reached a better equilibrium in the fourth quarter of 2020, the growth in our transaction volume and revenue normalized.\nInto 2021, the supply and demand in our Marketplace continued to be impacted by the semiconductor supply shortage and COVID-related production disruptions. These factors continue to limit the supply of new vehicles and contribute to short term volatility in used vehicle sales, including those on our Marketplace. New car supply has had\na significant impact on the supply of wholesale vehicles available within our Marketplace over the period, particularly through the fourth quarter of 2021 as dealer inventories reached historic lows.\nWe are continuing to monitor the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and industry. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact our business, and the broader implications of the pandemic on our sustained results of operations, remain uncertain.\nWe cannot predict how the pandemic will continue to develop, whether and to what extent government regulations or other restrictions may impact our operations or those of our customers, or whether and to what extent the pandemic or the effects thereof may have longer term unanticipated impacts on our business.\nKey Operating and Financial Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of operating and financial metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance. Our business metrics may be calculated in a manner different than similar business metrics used by other companies.\nTable 7: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketplace Units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>560,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>391,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketplace GMV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9 billion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3 billion\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketplace Buyers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketplace Sellers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44.1) million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.8) million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMarketplace Units\nMarketplace Units is a key indicator of our potential for growth in Marketplace GMV and revenue. It demonstrates the overall engagement of our customers on the ACV platform, the vibrancy of our digital marketplace and our market share of wholesale transactions in the United States. We define Marketplace Units as the number of vehicles transacted on our marketplace within the applicable period. Marketplace Units transacted includes any vehicle that successfully reaches sold status, even if the auction is subsequently unwound, meaning the buyer or seller does not complete the transaction. These instances have been immaterial to date. Marketplace Units exclude vehicles that were inspected by ACV, but not sold on our digital marketplace. Marketplace Units have increased over time as we have expanded our territory coverage, added new Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers to our platform and increased our share of wholesale transactions from existing customers. Because we only earn auction and ancillary fees in the case of a successful auction, Marketplace Units will remain a critical driver of our revenue growth.\nMarketplace GMV\nMarketplace GMV is primarily driven by the volume and dollar value of Marketplace Units transacted on our digital marketplace. We believe that Marketplace GMV acts as an indicator of the success of our marketplace, signaling satisfaction of dealers and buyers on our marketplace, and the health, scale, and growth of our business. We define Marketplace GMV as the total dollar value of vehicles transacted through our digital marketplace within the applicable period, excluding any auction and ancillary fees. Because our definition of Marketplace Units does not include vehicles inspected but not sold on our digital marketplace, GMV does not represent revenue earned by us. We expect that Marketplace GMV will continue to grow as Marketplace Units grow, though at a varying rate within a given applicable period, as Marketplace GMV is also impacted by the value of each vehicle transacted. Due to the historically high values of used automobiles in the current environment, it is possible that as values normalize in the future, Marketplace GMV could decline even as Marketplace Units grow.\nMarketplace Buyers\nWe define Marketplace Buyers as dealers or commercial partners with a unique customer ID that have transacted at least once in the last 12 months as a buyer on our digital marketplace. Marketplace Buyers include independent and franchise dealers buying on our marketplace.\nMarketplace Sellers\nWe define Marketplace Sellers as dealers or commercial partners with a unique customer ID that have transacted at least once in the last 12 months as a seller on our digital marketplace. Marketplace Sellers include independent and franchise dealers selling on our marketplace, as well as commercial partners, consisting of commercial leasing companies, rental car companies, bank or other finance companies, who use our marketplace to sell their inventory.\nWe monitor the growth in both Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers as they each promote a more vibrant and healthy marketplace. We believe that our growth in Marketplace Sellers and Marketplace Buyers over time has been driven by the value proposition of our offerings, and our sales and marketing success, including our ability to attract new dealers and commercial partners to our digital marketplace. Based on our current position in the market, we believe that we have significant opportunity to continue to increase the number of Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we use to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, interest (income) expense, other (income) expense, net, provision for income taxes, and other one-time, non-recurring items, when applicable. We monitor Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure to supplement the financial information we present in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results. For further explanation of the uses and limitations of this measure and a reconciliation of our Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss), please see -Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nWe expect Adjusted EBITDA to fluctuate in the near term as we continue to invest in our business and improve over the long term as we achieve greater scale in our business and efficiencies in our operating expenses.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe that the growth and future success of our business depend on many factors. While each of these factors presents significant opportunities for our business, they also pose important challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain our growth, improve our results of operations, and increase profitability.\nIncreasing Marketplace Units\nIncreasing Marketplace Units is a key driver of our revenue growth. The transparency, efficiency and vibrancy of our marketplace is critical to our ability to grow our share of wholesale transactions from existing customers and attract new buyers and sellers to our digital marketplace. Failure to increase the number of Marketplace Units would adversely affect our revenue growth, operating results, and the overall health of our marketplace.\nGrow Our Share of Wholesale Transactions from Existing Customers\nOur success depends in part on our ability to grow our share of wholesale transactions from existing customers, increasing their engagement and spend on our platform. We remain in the early stages of penetrating our Marketplace Buyers and Sellers' total number of wholesale transactions. As we continue to invest in eliminating key risks of uncertainty related to the auction process through our trusted and efficient digital marketplace, we expect\nthat we will capture an increasing share of transactions from our existing buyers and sellers. Our ability to increase share from existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including our customers' satisfaction with our platform, competition, pricing and overall changes in our customers' engagement levels.\nAdd New Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers\nWe believe we have a significant opportunity to add new marketplace participants. As we expand our presence within our existing territories, we are able to drive increased liquidity and greater vehicle selection, which in turn improves our ability to attract new Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers. Additionally, we intend to add more commercial consignors to our digital marketplace and capture a greater share of vehicles in the wholesale market that are sold to dealers by commercial consignors through auctions and private sales.\nOur ability to attract new Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers will depend on a number of factors including: the ability of our sales team to onboard dealers and commercial consignors onto our platform and ensure their satisfaction, the ability of our territory managers to build awareness of our brand, the ability of our vehicle condition inspectors, or VCIs, to cultivate relationships with our customers in their respective territories, and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.\nGrow Awareness for Our Offerings and Brand\nWholesale vehicle online penetration is just beginning, lagging the consumer automotive market, and we expect more dealers and commercial partners to source and manage their inventory online. As the digitization of the wholesale automotive market accelerates, we believe that our digital marketplace is well positioned to capture a disproportionate share of that growth. We plan to use targeted sales and marketing efforts to educate potential Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers as to the benefits of our offerings and drive adoption of our platform. Our ability to grow awareness of our offerings and brand depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022Secure Trusted Supply. The more trusted supply on our marketplace, the more buyers we can attract to our platform.\n\u2022Deepen Relationships with Dealers and Commercial Partners. We have a team of VCIs who work on our customers' lots to not only provide inspection services, but also to develop strong client relationships and ensure the highest quality service.\n\u2022Drive Customer Loyalty. Our loyal customers and referrals serve as a highly effective customer acquisition tool, and help drive our growth in a given territory.\n\u2022Grow Brand Awareness. We plan to invest in promoting our brand by targeted marketing spend and increase customer awareness in the territories in which we operate.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to successfully grow our market presence and market and sell existing and new products to both new and existing customers.\nGrow Value-Added and Data Services\nWe plan to continue to drive customer adoption of our existing value-added and data services and introduce new and complementary products. Our ability to drive higher attachment rates of existing value-added services, such as ACV Transportation and ACV Capital, will help grow our revenue. In 2019 we launched our financing arm, ACV Capital. In 2021 we added MAX Digital's flagship inventory management system to our portfolio of data services offerings. We plan to drive customer adoption of our data services such as our True360 Reports that bring transparency and offer insights into the condition and value of used vehicles as well as our inventory management system which enables dealers to accurately price wholesale and retail inventory while maximizing profit by leveraging predictive analytics informed by machine learning. These data services enable our customers to make more informed inventory management decisions both on and off our digital marketplace. In addition, we will continue to focus on developing new products and services that enhance our platform in areas including new data-powered products. Our ability to drive customer adoption of these products and services is dependent on the pricing of our products, the offerings of our competitors and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.\nInvestment in Growth\nWe are actively investing in our business. In order to support our future growth and expanded product offerings, we expect this investment to continue. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase as we continue to build our sales and marketing efforts, expand our employee base and invest in our technology development. The investments we make in our platform are designed to grow our revenue opportunity and to improve our operating results in the long term, but these investments could also delay our ability to achieve profitability or reduce our profitability in the near term. Our success is dependent on making value-generative investments that support our future growth.\nUsed Car Demand\nOur success depends in part on sufficient demand for used vehicles. Our recent growth over the last several years has coincided with a rising consumer demand for used vehicles. More recently, since early 2020, the demand for vehicles has outpaced supply as automotive manufacturers respond to the semiconductor supply shortage that continues to limit the supply of new automotive vehicles and contribute to short term volatility in used vehicle sales, including those on our Marketplace. We have seen new car supply have a significant impact on the supply of wholesale vehicles available within our Marketplace over this period, particularly through the fourth quarter of 2021 as dealer inventories have reached historic lows.\nUsed vehicle sales are also seasonal. Sales typically peak late in the first calendar quarter and early in the second quarter, with the lowest relative level of industry vehicle sales occurring in the fourth calendar quarter. Due to our rapid growth since launch, our sales patterns to date have not been entirely reflective of the general seasonality of the used vehicle market, but we expect this to normalize as our business matures. Seasonality also impacts used vehicle pricing, with used vehicles depreciating at a faster rate in the last two quarters of each year and a slower rate in the first two quarters of each year. We may experience seasonal and other fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations, which may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. See the section titled -Seasonality\u201d for additional information on the impacts of seasonality on our business.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nMarketplace and Service Revenue\nWe have historically generated the majority of our revenue from our digital marketplace where we earn auction and ancillary fees from both buyers and sellers, in each case only upon a successful auction. Our marketplace and service revenue consists principally of revenue earned from facilitating auctions and arranging for the transportation of vehicles purchased in such auctions.\nWe act as an agent when facilitating a vehicle auction through the marketplace. Auction and related fees charged to the buyer and seller are reported as revenue on a net basis, excluding the price of the auctioned vehicle in the transaction.\nWe act as a principal when arranging for the transportation of vehicles purchased on the marketplace and leverage our network of third-party transportation carriers to secure the arrangement. Transportation fees charged to the buyer are reported on a gross basis.\nWe also generate data services revenue through our True360 reports and MAX Digital inventory management software subscriptions and offer short-term inventory financing to eligible customers purchasing vehicles through the marketplace.\nCustomer Assurance Revenue\nWe also generate revenue by providing our Go Green assurance to sellers on the condition of certain vehicles sold on the marketplace, which is considered a guarantee under GAAP. This assurance option is only available for\nsellers who have enrolled in the service on qualifying vehicles for which we have prepared the vehicle condition report. Customer assurance revenue also includes revenue from other price guarantee products offered to sellers. Customer assurance revenue is measured based upon the fair value of the Go Green assurance that we provide. We expect the fair value per vehicle assured to decrease over time as we continue to improve the quality of our inspection product, which in turn reduces the costs of satisfying such assurance.\nOperating Expenses\nMarketplace and Service Cost of Revenue\nMarketplace and service cost of revenue consists of third-party transportation carrier costs, titles shipping costs, customer support, website hosting costs, inspection costs related to data services and various other costs. These costs include salaries, benefits, bonuses and related stock-based compensation expenses, which we refer to as personnel expenses. We expect our marketplace and service cost of revenue to continue to increase as we continue to scale our business and introduce new product and service offerings.\nCustomer Assurance Cost of Revenue\nCustomer assurance cost of revenue consists of the costs related to satisfying claims against the vehicle condition guarantees, and other price guarantees. We expect that our customer assurance cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows, particularly as we provide guarantees on an increasing number of vehicles.\nOperations and Technology\nOperations and technology expense consists of costs for wholesale auction inspections, personnel costs related to payments and titles processing, transportation processing, product and engineering and other general operations and technology expenses. These costs include personnel-related expenses and other allocated facility and office costs. We expect that our operations and technology expense will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows, particularly as we incur additional costs related to continued investments in our marketplace, transportation capabilities and other technologies.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expense consists of costs resulting from sales, accounting, finance, legal, marketing, human resources, executive, and other administrative activities. These costs include personnel-related expenses, legal and other professional services expenses and other allocated facility and office costs. Also included in selling, general and administrative expense is advertising and marketing costs to promote our services. We expect that our selling, general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. However, we expect that our selling, general and administrative expense will decrease as a percentage of our revenue as our revenue grows over the longer term.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation of fixed assets, and amortization of acquired intangible assets and internal-use software.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and interest expense on our borrowings.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists of U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our Consolidated Statements of Operations data for the periods presented:\nTable 8: <table> <tr>

The increase of $135.3 million, or 78%, was primarily driven by an increase in auction marketplace revenue from our buyers and sellers, as well as an increase in revenue earned\nfrom arranging for the transportation of vehicles to buyers, data and other service revenue. Revenue increases in the current year were primarily volume-driven and correlate to per unit GMV, which rose due to the increase in demand for used vehicles on a national level, leading to higher buyer revenue per unit. Additionally, we raised the buyer fees charged on our marketplace effective in December 2021 that further contributed to the increase in revenue year-over-year, and specifically within the fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2021, auction marketplace revenue increased to $164.3 million from $99.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, and transportation, data and other services revenue increased to $144.1 million from $73.9 million.\nCustomer Assurance Revenue\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Customer assurance revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCustomer assurance revenue was $50.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, Go Green assurance revenue increased to $45.4 million from $32.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenue increases were primarily volume-driven as a result of the expansion of our marketplace platform across the United States and a deeper penetration of markets where we do business, and were partially offset by a decline in the fair value of the Go Green assurance offering.\nOperating Expenses\nMarketplace and Service Cost of Revenue\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketplace and service cost of revenue (excluding\ndepreciation & amortization)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMarketplace and service cost of revenue was $159.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $83.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

However, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, provides investors with additional useful information in evaluating our performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, when taken together with our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance and facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations or outlook. In particular, we believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA is helpful to our investors as it is a measure used by management in assessing the health of our business and evaluating our operating performance, as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes.\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations include that: (i) it does not properly reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future; (ii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect these capital expenditures; (iii) it does not consider the impact of stock-based compensation expense; (iv) it does not reflect other non-operating expenses, including interest expense; (v) it does not consider the impact of any contingent consideration liability valuation adjustments; and (vi) it does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us. In addition, our use of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, when evaluating our performance, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial measures, including our net loss and other results stated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(78,182\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(41,021\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest (income) expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(115\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>489\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,054\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(44,137\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(30,752\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed operations since our inception primarily through our marketplace revenue, borrowings under our debt facilities and the net proceeds we have received from sales of equity securities as further detailed below. In March 2021, we completed our IPO which resulted in aggregate net proceeds of $388.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $566.0 million, and investments in marketable securities totaling $13.8 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months and for the long-term. Our future capital requirements over the long-term will depend on many factors, including volume of sales with existing customers, expansion of sales and marketing activities to acquire new customers, timing and extent of spending to support development efforts and introduction of new and enhanced services. We may, in the future, enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, and technologies. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that we require additional financing, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our principal commitments primarily consist of long-term debt and leases for office space. We have $1.4 million of lease obligations due within a year, and an additional $2.1 million of lease obligations due at various dates through 2027. Refer to Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nIn order to compete successfully and sustain operations at current levels over the next 12 months, we will be required to devote a significant amount of operating cash flow to our human capital in the form of salaries and wages. Additionally, we enter into purchase commitments for goods and services made in the ordinary course of business. These purchase commitments include goods and services received and recorded as liabilities as of\nDecember 31, 2021 as well goods and services which have not yet been delivered or performed and have, therefore, not been reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations. These commitments typically become due after the delivery and completion of such goods or services.\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity to date, we plan to continue to evaluate aspects of our spending, including capital expenditures, discretionary spending, and strategic investments in 2022. We have considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our liquidity and capital resources to date, and we do not currently expect it to impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs or affect our ability to comply with debt covenants. We believe we are well-positioned to manage our business and have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet our cash requirements using available cash and equivalents, investments in marketable securities, and borrowing under our revolving credit facilities.\nA substantial amount of our working capital is generated from the payments received for services which we provide. We settle transactions among buyers and sellers using the marketplace, and as a result the value of the vehicles passes through our balance sheet. Because our receivables typically have been, on average, settled faster than our payables, our cash position at each balance sheet date has been bolstered by marketplace float. Changes in working capital vary from quarter-to-quarter as a result of GMV and the timing of collections and disbursements of funds related to auctions held near period end.\nOur Debt Arrangements\nWe currently have a revolving credit facility with Credit Suisse AG, New York Branch, or the 2019 Revolver, which we entered into in December 2019. We entered into an amendment to the 2019 Revolver on June 25, 2021. We also entered into a revolving credit facility with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., or the 2021 Revolver, on August 24, 2021.\nOne of our wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries, ACV Capital Funding LLC, is the borrower under the 2019 Revolver, which provides for a revolving line of credit in the aggregate amount of up to $50.0 million, with borrowing availability subject to a borrowing base calculated as a percentage of ACV Capital Funding LLC's eligible receivables. The 2019 Revolver is secured by the borrowing base of eligible receivables. In addition, we entered into a separate indemnity agreement in connection with the 2019 Revolver under which we provided an unsecured guaranty of (a) 10% of the outstanding loans under the 2019 Revolver at the time of any event of default and (b) any losses, damages or other expenses incurred by the lenders under the 2019 Revolver, payable in the event of certain specified acts by ACV Capital Funding LLC. The interest rate on any outstanding borrowings is at LIBOR plus 3.75%, subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, and interest payments are payable monthly. The 2019 Revolver has a maturity date of June 25, 2024. The 2019 Revolver also contains customary covenants that limit ACV Capital Funding LLC's ability to enter into indebtedness, make distributions and make investments, among other restrictions. The 2019 Revolver contains a liquidity covenant based on cash on hand, a tangible net worth covenant based on ACV Capital's consolidated net worth, a tangible net worth covenant based on our consolidated net worth, a leverage covenant based on our consolidated leverage and certain other financial covenants tied to ACV Capital's eligible receivables.\nWe are the borrower under the 2021 Revolver, which provides for a revolving line of credit in the aggregate principal amount of up to $160.0 million. The 2021 Revolver also includes a sub facility that provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to $20.0 million outstanding at any time. The 2021 Revolver is guaranteed by substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of our and such subsidiaries' assets. The interest rate applicable to the 2021 Revolver is, at our option, either (a) LIBOR (or a replacement rate established in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement for the 2021 Revolver) (subject to a 0.00% LIBOR floor), plus a margin of 2.75% per annum or (b) the Alternate Base Rate plus a margin of 1.75% per annum. The Alternate Base Rate is the highest of (a) the Wall Street Journal prime rate, (b) the NYFRB rate plus 0.5% and (c)(i) 1.00% plus (ii) the adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period. The 2021 Revolver has a maturity date of August 24, 2026. The 2021 Revolver contains customary covenants that limit our ability to enter into indebtedness, make distributions and make investments, among other restrictions. The 2021 Revolver also contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum liquidity level and achieve specified trailing four quarter revenue targets.\nWe were in compliance with all such applicable covenants as of December 31, 2021, and believe we are in compliance as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2021, we had $0.5 million drawn under the 2019 Revolver, and there was an outstanding letter of credit issued under the 2021 Revolver in the amount of $1.1 million. There were no other amounts outstanding under the 2021 Revolver.\nCash Flows from Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented:\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(129,266\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,673\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net increase in cash and equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>332,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash is cash collection from fees earned on our marketplace services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel expenses, marketing expenses and overhead expenses.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities of $85.3 million was primarily related to our net loss of $78.2 million, adjusted for net cash inflows of $125.9 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, and for non-cash charges of $37.6 million. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, and provision for bad debt. The change in operating assets and liabilities were the result of a $120.2 million increase in accounts receivable and $2.7 million increase in other operating assets, which were offset by a $242.9 million increase in accounts payable and a $5.8 million increase in other current and non-current liabilities.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities of $10.4 million was primarily related to our net loss of $41.0 million, adjusted for net cash inflows $35.4 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, and for non-cash charges of $16.0 million. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, and provision for bad debt, partially offset by contingent gains. The change in operating assets and liabilities were the result of a $29.2 million increase in accounts receivable and $6.4 million increase in other operating assets, which were offset by a $66.2 million increase in accounts payable and a $4.8 million increase in other current and non-current liabilities.\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 relative to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by an increase in marketplace float of $119.2 million. Marketplace float exists when our receivables from Marketplace Buyers are settled faster than our payables to Marketplace Sellers, thereby bolstering our cash flows from operating activities.\nInvesting Activities\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $129.3 million and $19.7 million, respectively, primarily related to capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment to support field and site operations, along with capitalized software development costs to support continued technology innovation, increases in finance receivables, and the use of cash for the acquisition of businesses.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 relative to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by an additional $59.0 million investments in acquisition of businesses in 2021, additional $31.7 million increase in finance receivables, and $13.8 million of investments made in marketable securities.\nFinancing Activities\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $376.2 million and was primarily the result of proceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to the IPO, which were offset by net repayments of long term debt during the period, payments for debt issuance and other financing costs, and the payment of RSU tax withholdings in exchange for shares of common stock surrendered by RSU holders.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $60.8 million and was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of Series E-1 preferred stock and net proceeds from long term debt.\nAcquisitions\nIn the second quarter of 2020, we acquired certain assets from ASI Services LLC, or ASI, for a total purchase consideration of $11.2 million. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method. ASI, headquartered in Cincinnati, OH, was a privately held corporation that primarily focused on providing inspection services for off-lease vehicles to financial institutions. The acquisition of ASI enabled us to expand our position in the used vehicle industry and enhance our service offerings with dealers and commercial partners.\nIn the third quarter of 2021, we completed an acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Max Digital LLC, or Max Digital, for approximately $61.4 million. The total purchase price was paid in cash. The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, the results of the acquired business have been included in our results of operations from the acquisition date. In connection with the acquisition, we incurred approximately $1.1 million of transaction costs. The acquisition of Max Digital enabled us to expand our position in the used vehicle industry and enhance our service offerings with dealers and commercial partners.\nAlso during 2021, we completed other business combinations for total consideration of approximately $6.9 million, net of cash acquired. The transactions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, the results of the acquired business have been included in our results of operations from the respective acquisition dates. These acquisitions enabled us to expand our position in the used vehicle industry and enhance our service offerings between dealers and commercial partners.\nSeasonality\nThe volume of vehicles sold through our auctions generally fluctuates from quarter to quarter. This seasonality is caused by several factors, including holidays, weather, the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles and the timing of federal tax returns, which affects the demand side of the auction industry. As a result, revenue and operating expenses related to volume will fluctuate accordingly on a quarterly basis. In the fourth quarter, we typically experience lower used vehicle auction volume as well as additional costs associated with the holidays. Seasonally depressed used vehicle auction volume typically continues during the winter months through the first quarter. Typical seasonality trends may not be observed in periods where other external factors more significantly impact the industry.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe believe that the following accounting policies involve a high degree of judgement and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our other significant accounting policies. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in those financial statements and accompanying notes. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. Determining whether performance obligations should be accounted for separately or combined may require significant judgment. For each performance obligation within a contract, we evaluate whether we act as the principal or as an agent. When we act as the principal, revenue is recognized in the gross amount of the consideration received from the customer recognized at the point in time the services are completed. When we act as the agent, revenue is recognized net of the consideration due to a third party at the point in time when the services are provided.\nIn contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation proportionately based on the estimated stand-alone selling price, or SSP, of each performance obligation. We use an observable price to determine the SSP for each performance obligation. Where observable prices are not available, an expected cost-plus margin approach is used. We then determine how the services are transferred to the customer to determine the timing of revenue recognition.\nFrom time to time we provide promotions and incentives to buyers and sellers in various forms including discounts on fees, credits and rebates. Promotions and incentives which are consideration payable to a customer are recognized as a reduction of revenue when revenue is recognized.\nCommissions paid to sales representatives and related payroll taxes are considered costs to obtain a contract. Financial Accounting Standard Board Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 340, Other Assets and Deferred Costs, requires costs to obtain a contract with a customer within the scope of Accounting Standards Update No. 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, to be capitalized and amortized over the period of benefit. We have elected the practical expedient available under ASC 340-40-25-4 to immediately expense the incremental cost of obtaining a contract when the underlying related asset would have been amortized over one year or less.\nWe have utilized the practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-50-14 and do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.\nGeneral Guarantees\nWe provide certain guarantees to Sellers in the Marketplace in the ordinary course of business, which are accounted for under ASC 460 as a general guarantee.\nVehicle Condition Guarantees-We offer guarantees to sellers in qualifying situations where we performed a vehicle inspection and prepared the vehicle condition report. The guarantee provides us with the right to retain proceeds from the subsequent liquidation of the vehicle covered under the guarantee. The fair value of vehicle condition guarantees issued is estimated based on historical results and other qualitative factors. The vehicle condition guarantee revenue is recognized on the earlier of the guarantee expiration date or the guarantee settlement date.\nOther Price Guarantees-We provide sellers with a price guarantee for vehicles to be sold on the Marketplace from time to time. If a vehicle sells below the guaranteed price, then we are responsible for paying the Seller the difference between the guaranteed price and the final sale price. The term of the guarantee is typically less than one week.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe use the fair value recognition provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. The estimated fair value of each common stock option award is calculated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Application of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires significant judgment, and involves the use of subjective assumptions including:\n\u2022Expected Term-The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. As we do not have sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term of the stock option awards granted, the simplified method was used to determine the expected term for awards issued to employees.\n\u2022Risk-Free Interest Rate-The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury constant maturity notes with terms approximately equal to the stock-based awards' expected term.\n\u2022Expected Volatility-Since we are newly public and do not have a trading history of common stock, the expected volatility is derived from the average historical stock volatilities of the common stock of several public companies considered to be comparable to us over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock-based awards.\n\u2022Dividend Rate-The expected dividend rate is zero as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.\n\u2022Fair Value of Common Stock-Prior to the IPO, we estimated the fair value of common stock. Our board of directors, with input from management, considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock at each meeting in which award were approved. Subsequent to the IPO, the fair value of the underlying common stock is determined by the closing price, on the date of grant, of the Company's Class A common stock, which is traded publicly on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nWe measure all stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees, directors, consultants and other nonemployees based on the fair value on the date of the grant. The options vest based on a graded scale over the stated vesting period, and compensation expense is recognized based on their grant date fair value on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\nThe fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are determined based on the estimated market price of our common stock on the grant date. The awards and units vest over time and compensation expense is recognized based on their grant fair value ratably over the requisite service period.\nWe classify stock-based compensation expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same way the payroll costs or service payments are classified for the related stock-based award recipient.\nInternal-Use Software Costs\nWe capitalize internal-use software costs during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. This software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, generally three years. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, or more frequently when warranted.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives. We evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is subject to an impairment test.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as one singular reporting unit on October 1 or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our policy is to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely or not that the reporting unit's carrying value is less than its fair value, indicating the potential for goodwill impairment. If the reporting unit fails the qualitative test, then we proceed with a quantitative test. We then determine whether the reporting unit fair value\nis less than its carrying amount, and if it is, we recognize a goodwill impairment equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period under the JOBS Act for the adoption of certain accounting standards until the earlier of the date we (1) are no longer an emerging growth company or (2) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10- K.

Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Final Prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) on March 24, 2021.\nOverview\nOur mission is to build and enable the most trusted and efficient digital marketplace for buying and selling used vehicles with transparency and comprehensive data that was previously unimaginable.\nWe provide a highly efficient and vibrant digital marketplace for wholesale vehicle transactions and data services that offer transparent and accurate vehicle information to our customers. Our platform leverages data insights and technology to power our digital marketplace and data services, enabling our dealers and commercial partners to buy, sell, and value vehicles with confidence and efficiency. We strive to solve the challenges that the used automotive industry has faced for generations and provide powerful technology-enabled capabilities to our dealers and commercial partners who fulfill a critical role in the automotive ecosystem. We help dealers source and manage inventory and accurately price their vehicles as well as process payments, transfer titles, manage arbitrations, and finance and transport vehicles. Our platform encompasses:\n\u2022Digital Marketplace. Connects buyers and sellers of wholesale vehicles in an intuitive and efficient manner. Our core marketplace offering is a 20-minute live auction, which facilitates instant transactions of wholesale vehicles, and is available across multiple platforms including mobile apps, desktop, and directly through API integration. We also offer transportation and financing services to facilitate the entire transaction journey.\n\u2022Data Services. Offer insights into the condition and value of used vehicles for transactions both on and off our marketplace and help dealers, their end consumers, and commercial partners make more informed decisions and transact with confidence and efficiency. We enable dealers to manage their inventory and set pricing more effectively while turning vehicles faster and maximizing profit by leveraging predictive analytics informed by machine learning and market data.\n\u2022Data and Technology. Underpins everything we do, and powers our vehicle inspections, comprehensive vehicle intelligence reports, digital marketplace, inventory management software, and operations automation.\nWe have historically generated the majority of our revenue from our digital marketplace where we earn auction and ancillary fees from both buyers and sellers in each case only upon a successful auction. Buyer auction fees are variable based on the price of the vehicle, while seller auction fees include a fixed auction fee and an optional fee for the elective condition report associated with the vehicle. We also earn ancillary fees through additional value-added services to buyers and sellers in connection with the auction.\nOur customers include participants on our marketplace and purchasers of our data services. Certain dealers and commercial partners purchase data services in connection with vehicle assessments, software subscriptions, and transactions that do not occur on our marketplace. Our dealer customers include a majority of the top 100 used vehicle dealers in the United States.\nWe had 560,959 and 391,466 Marketplace Units sold on our marketplace, representing a total Marketplace Gross Merchandise Value, or Marketplace GMV, of $7.9 billion and $3.3 billion, for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we generated revenue of $358.4 million and $208.4 million, net loss of $78.2 million and $41.0 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $(44.1) million and $(30.8) million, respectively. We continue to invest in growth to scale our company responsibly and drive towards sustained profitability. See the section titled -Key Operating and Financial Metrics\u201d for additional information on Marketplace Units, Marketplace GMV and Adjusted EBITDA.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business\nBeginning in March 2020, our business and operations began to experience the effects of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, COVID-19 significantly disrupted the operations of our customers, most of whom are automotive dealers who sell both new and used vehicles to consumers in physical dealership stores. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate instituted shelter-in-place orders, forcing many physical automotive dealership stores to close in March and April and cutting off consumer foot traffic, which led to a decline in overall vehicle sales to consumers.\nThe slowdown in the retail sales of used vehicles subsequently impacted the market for wholesale automotive transactions. Wholesale is one of the most common supply sources through which dealers acquire used vehicle inventory to sell retail. With a sudden decline in retail sales of these dealerships, dealers' demand for wholesale transactions also decreased sharply. In addition, most automotive wholesale transactions in the United States are conducted through physical or hybrid auctions that still require physical operations, and shelter-in-place orders forced these traditional auctions to temporarily shut down operations.\nNegative trends in transaction volume driven by COVID began to be observed near the end of the first quarter of 2020. For the month ended March 31, 2020, our Marketplace Units decreased 20% month-over-month. This decline accelerated early in the second quarter; in the month ended April 30, 2020, Marketplace Units were down approximately 29% month-over-month. In addition to declining transaction volumes, because supply of wholesale vehicles exceeded the market demand during these months, we saw the average sales price per unit decline by over 31% from the month ended February 29, 2020 to the month ended April 30, 2020.\nThis initial disruption began to subside in May 2020 as the demand for used vehicles on a national level began to outpace supply, leading to higher used vehicle valuations and a higher percentage of successful auctions on our marketplace. Moreover, an increasing number of dealers and commercial partners looked to a fully digital marketplace to transact remotely as traditional, in-person wholesale auctions continued to experience COVID-19-related disruptions and faced challenges in restoring normal operations.\nAs a result, starting in May 2020, our marketplace activity rebounded strongly to reach levels higher than the months of January and February 2020 prior to the impact of COVID-19. For the month ended May 31, 2020, both our Marketplace Units and our revenue approximately doubled compared to the month ended April 30, 2020. Driven by both higher demand for used vehicles leading to less discounting and increased overall valuations, the average sale price of our Marketplace Unit, and subsequently our auction revenue per unit, also increased starting in May 2020 and reached peak levels in August 2020. As supply constraints began to ease and the demand and supply for used vehicles reached a better equilibrium in the fourth quarter of 2020, the growth in our transaction volume and revenue normalized.\nInto 2021, the supply and demand in our Marketplace continued to be impacted by the semiconductor supply shortage and COVID-related production disruptions. These factors continue to limit the supply of new vehicles and contribute to short term volatility in used vehicle sales, including those on our Marketplace. New car supply has had\na significant impact on the supply of wholesale vehicles available within our Marketplace over the period, particularly through the fourth quarter of 2021 as dealer inventories reached historic lows.\nWe are continuing to monitor the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and industry. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact our business, and the broader implications of the pandemic on our sustained results of operations, remain uncertain.\nWe cannot predict how the pandemic will continue to develop, whether and to what extent government regulations or other restrictions may impact our operations or those of our customers, or whether and to what extent the pandemic or the effects thereof may have longer term unanticipated impacts on our business.\nKey Operating and Financial Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of operating and financial metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance. Our business metrics may be calculated in a manner different than similar business metrics used by other companies.\n\nMarketplace Units\nMarketplace Units is a key indicator of our potential for growth in Marketplace GMV and revenue. It demonstrates the overall engagement of our customers on the ACV platform, the vibrancy of our digital marketplace and our market share of wholesale transactions in the United States. We define Marketplace Units as the number of vehicles transacted on our marketplace within the applicable period. Marketplace Units transacted includes any vehicle that successfully reaches sold status, even if the auction is subsequently unwound, meaning the buyer or seller does not complete the transaction. These instances have been immaterial to date. Marketplace Units exclude vehicles that were inspected by ACV, but not sold on our digital marketplace. Marketplace Units have increased over time as we have expanded our territory coverage, added new Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers to our platform and increased our share of wholesale transactions from existing customers. Because we only earn auction and ancillary fees in the case of a successful auction, Marketplace Units will remain a critical driver of our revenue growth.\nMarketplace GMV\nMarketplace GMV is primarily driven by the volume and dollar value of Marketplace Units transacted on our digital marketplace. We believe that Marketplace GMV acts as an indicator of the success of our marketplace, signaling satisfaction of dealers and buyers on our marketplace, and the health, scale, and growth of our business. We define Marketplace GMV as the total dollar value of vehicles transacted through our digital marketplace within the applicable period, excluding any auction and ancillary fees. Because our definition of Marketplace Units does not include vehicles inspected but not sold on our digital marketplace, GMV does not represent revenue earned by us. We expect that Marketplace GMV will continue to grow as Marketplace Units grow, though at a varying rate within a given applicable period, as Marketplace GMV is also impacted by the value of each vehicle transacted. Due to the historically high values of used automobiles in the current environment, it is possible that as values normalize in the future, Marketplace GMV could decline even as Marketplace Units grow.\nMarketplace Buyers\nWe define Marketplace Buyers as dealers or commercial partners with a unique customer ID that have transacted at least once in the last 12 months as a buyer on our digital marketplace. Marketplace Buyers include independent and franchise dealers buying on our marketplace.\nMarketplace Sellers\nWe define Marketplace Sellers as dealers or commercial partners with a unique customer ID that have transacted at least once in the last 12 months as a seller on our digital marketplace. Marketplace Sellers include independent and franchise dealers selling on our marketplace, as well as commercial partners, consisting of commercial leasing companies, rental car companies, bank or other finance companies, who use our marketplace to sell their inventory.\nWe monitor the growth in both Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers as they each promote a more vibrant and healthy marketplace. We believe that our growth in Marketplace Sellers and Marketplace Buyers over time has been driven by the value proposition of our offerings, and our sales and marketing success, including our ability to attract new dealers and commercial partners to our digital marketplace. Based on our current position in the market, we believe that we have significant opportunity to continue to increase the number of Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we use to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, interest (income) expense, other (income) expense, net, provision for income taxes, and other one-time, non-recurring items, when applicable. We monitor Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure to supplement the financial information we present in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results. For further explanation of the uses and limitations of this measure and a reconciliation of our Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss), please see -Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nWe expect Adjusted EBITDA to fluctuate in the near term as we continue to invest in our business and improve over the long term as we achieve greater scale in our business and efficiencies in our operating expenses.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe that the growth and future success of our business depend on many factors. While each of these factors presents significant opportunities for our business, they also pose important challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain our growth, improve our results of operations, and increase profitability.\nIncreasing Marketplace Units\nIncreasing Marketplace Units is a key driver of our revenue growth. The transparency, efficiency and vibrancy of our marketplace is critical to our ability to grow our share of wholesale transactions from existing customers and attract new buyers and sellers to our digital marketplace. Failure to increase the number of Marketplace Units would adversely affect our revenue growth, operating results, and the overall health of our marketplace.\nGrow Our Share of Wholesale Transactions from Existing Customers\nOur success depends in part on our ability to grow our share of wholesale transactions from existing customers, increasing their engagement and spend on our platform. We remain in the early stages of penetrating our Marketplace Buyers and Sellers' total number of wholesale transactions. As we continue to invest in eliminating key risks of uncertainty related to the auction process through our trusted and efficient digital marketplace, we expect\nthat we will capture an increasing share of transactions from our existing buyers and sellers. Our ability to increase share from existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including our customers' satisfaction with our platform, competition, pricing and overall changes in our customers' engagement levels.\nAdd New Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers\nWe believe we have a significant opportunity to add new marketplace participants. As we expand our presence within our existing territories, we are able to drive increased liquidity and greater vehicle selection, which in turn improves our ability to attract new Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers. Additionally, we intend to add more commercial consignors to our digital marketplace and capture a greater share of vehicles in the wholesale market that are sold to dealers by commercial consignors through auctions and private sales.\nOur ability to attract new Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers will depend on a number of factors including: the ability of our sales team to onboard dealers and commercial consignors onto our platform and ensure their satisfaction, the ability of our territory managers to build awareness of our brand, the ability of our vehicle condition inspectors, or VCIs, to cultivate relationships with our customers in their respective territories, and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.\nGrow Awareness for Our Offerings and Brand\nWholesale vehicle online penetration is just beginning, lagging the consumer automotive market, and we expect more dealers and commercial partners to source and manage their inventory online. As the digitization of the wholesale automotive market accelerates, we believe that our digital marketplace is well positioned to capture a disproportionate share of that growth. We plan to use targeted sales and marketing efforts to educate potential Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers as to the benefits of our offerings and drive adoption of our platform. Our ability to grow awareness of our offerings and brand depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022Secure Trusted Supply. The more trusted supply on our marketplace, the more buyers we can attract to our platform.\n\u2022Deepen Relationships with Dealers and Commercial Partners. We have a team of VCIs who work on our customers' lots to not only provide inspection services, but also to develop strong client relationships and ensure the highest quality service.\n\u2022Drive Customer Loyalty. Our loyal customers and referrals serve as a highly effective customer acquisition tool, and help drive our growth in a given territory.\n\u2022Grow Brand Awareness. We plan to invest in promoting our brand by targeted marketing spend and increase customer awareness in the territories in which we operate.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to successfully grow our market presence and market and sell existing and new products to both new and existing customers.\nGrow Value-Added and Data Services\nWe plan to continue to drive customer adoption of our existing value-added and data services and introduce new and complementary products. Our ability to drive higher attachment rates of existing value-added services, such as ACV Transportation and ACV Capital, will help grow our revenue. In 2019 we launched our financing arm, ACV Capital. In 2021 we added MAX Digital's flagship inventory management system to our portfolio of data services offerings. We plan to drive customer adoption of our data services such as our True360 Reports that bring transparency and offer insights into the condition and value of used vehicles as well as our inventory management system which enables dealers to accurately price wholesale and retail inventory while maximizing profit by leveraging predictive analytics informed by machine learning. These data services enable our customers to make more informed inventory management decisions both on and off our digital marketplace. In addition, we will continue to focus on developing new products and services that enhance our platform in areas including new data-powered products. Our ability to drive customer adoption of these products and services is dependent on the pricing of our products, the offerings of our competitors and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.\nInvestment in Growth\nWe are actively investing in our business. In order to support our future growth and expanded product offerings, we expect this investment to continue. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase as we continue to build our sales and marketing efforts, expand our employee base and invest in our technology development. The investments we make in our platform are designed to grow our revenue opportunity and to improve our operating results in the long term, but these investments could also delay our ability to achieve profitability or reduce our profitability in the near term. Our success is dependent on making value-generative investments that support our future growth.\nUsed Car Demand\nOur success depends in part on sufficient demand for used vehicles. Our recent growth over the last several years has coincided with a rising consumer demand for used vehicles. More recently, since early 2020, the demand for vehicles has outpaced supply as automotive manufacturers respond to the semiconductor supply shortage that continues to limit the supply of new automotive vehicles and contribute to short term volatility in used vehicle sales, including those on our Marketplace. We have seen new car supply have a significant impact on the supply of wholesale vehicles available within our Marketplace over this period, particularly through the fourth quarter of 2021 as dealer inventories have reached historic lows.\nUsed vehicle sales are also seasonal. Sales typically peak late in the first calendar quarter and early in the second quarter, with the lowest relative level of industry vehicle sales occurring in the fourth calendar quarter. Due to our rapid growth since launch, our sales patterns to date have not been entirely reflective of the general seasonality of the used vehicle market, but we expect this to normalize as our business matures. Seasonality also impacts used vehicle pricing, with used vehicles depreciating at a faster rate in the last two quarters of each year and a slower rate in the first two quarters of each year. We may experience seasonal and other fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations, which may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. See the section titled -Seasonality\u201d for additional information on the impacts of seasonality on our business.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nMarketplace and Service Revenue\nWe have historically generated the majority of our revenue from our digital marketplace where we earn auction and ancillary fees from both buyers and sellers, in each case only upon a successful auction. Our marketplace and service revenue consists principally of revenue earned from facilitating auctions and arranging for the transportation of vehicles purchased in such auctions.\nWe act as an agent when facilitating a vehicle auction through the marketplace. Auction and related fees charged to the buyer and seller are reported as revenue on a net basis, excluding the price of the auctioned vehicle in the transaction.\nWe act as a principal when arranging for the transportation of vehicles purchased on the marketplace and leverage our network of third-party transportation carriers to secure the arrangement. Transportation fees charged to the buyer are reported on a gross basis.\nWe also generate data services revenue through our True360 reports and MAX Digital inventory management software subscriptions and offer short-term inventory financing to eligible customers purchasing vehicles through the marketplace.\nCustomer Assurance Revenue\nWe also generate revenue by providing our Go Green assurance to sellers on the condition of certain vehicles sold on the marketplace, which is considered a guarantee under GAAP. This assurance option is only available for\nsellers who have enrolled in the service on qualifying vehicles for which we have prepared the vehicle condition report. Customer assurance revenue also includes revenue from other price guarantee products offered to sellers. Customer assurance revenue is measured based upon the fair value of the Go Green assurance that we provide. We expect the fair value per vehicle assured to decrease over time as we continue to improve the quality of our inspection product, which in turn reduces the costs of satisfying such assurance.\nOperating Expenses\nMarketplace and Service Cost of Revenue\nMarketplace and service cost of revenue consists of third-party transportation carrier costs, titles shipping costs, customer support, website hosting costs, inspection costs related to data services and various other costs. These costs include salaries, benefits, bonuses and related stock-based compensation expenses, which we refer to as personnel expenses. We expect our marketplace and service cost of revenue to continue to increase as we continue to scale our business and introduce new product and service offerings.\nCustomer Assurance Cost of Revenue\nCustomer assurance cost of revenue consists of the costs related to satisfying claims against the vehicle condition guarantees, and other price guarantees. We expect that our customer assurance cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows, particularly as we provide guarantees on an increasing number of vehicles.\nOperations and Technology\nOperations and technology expense consists of costs for wholesale auction inspections, personnel costs related to payments and titles processing, transportation processing, product and engineering and other general operations and technology expenses. These costs include personnel-related expenses and other allocated facility and office costs. We expect that our operations and technology expense will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows, particularly as we incur additional costs related to continued investments in our marketplace, transportation capabilities and other technologies.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expense consists of costs resulting from sales, accounting, finance, legal, marketing, human resources, executive, and other administrative activities. These costs include personnel-related expenses, legal and other professional services expenses and other allocated facility and office costs. Also included in selling, general and administrative expense is advertising and marketing costs to promote our services. We expect that our selling, general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. However, we expect that our selling, general and administrative expense will decrease as a percentage of our revenue as our revenue grows over the longer term.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation of fixed assets, and amortization of acquired intangible assets and internal-use software.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and interest expense on our borrowings.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists of U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our Consolidated Statements of Operations data for the periods presented:\n\n\nThe following table sets forth our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss for the periods presented:\n\nThe following table sets forth our Consolidated Statements of Operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the periods presented:\n\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020\nRevenue\nMarketplace and Service Revenue\n\nMarketplace and service revenue was $308.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $173.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $135.3 million, or 78%, was primarily driven by an increase in auction marketplace revenue from our buyers and sellers, as well as an increase in revenue earned\nfrom arranging for the transportation of vehicles to buyers, data and other service revenue. Revenue increases in the current year were primarily volume-driven and correlate to per unit GMV, which rose due to the increase in demand for used vehicles on a national level, leading to higher buyer revenue per unit. Additionally, we raised the buyer fees charged on our marketplace effective in December 2021 that further contributed to the increase in revenue year-over-year, and specifically within the fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2021, auction marketplace revenue increased to $164.3 million from $99.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, and transportation, data and other services revenue increased to $144.1 million from $73.9 million.\nCustomer Assurance Revenue\n\nCustomer assurance revenue was $50.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $14.8 million, or 42%, primarily consisted of an increase in revenue generated from Go Green assurance offerings sold to the seller in marketplace transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Go Green assurance revenue increased to $45.4 million from $32.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenue increases were primarily volume-driven as a result of the expansion of our marketplace platform across the United States and a deeper penetration of markets where we do business, and were partially offset by a decline in the fair value of the Go Green assurance offering.\nOperating Expenses\nMarketplace and Service Cost of Revenue\n\nMarketplace and service cost of revenue was $159.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $83.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $75.9 million, or 91%, primarily consisted of an increase in the cost of generating auction marketplace revenue and an increase attributed to the cost of generating transportation, data and other services revenue, which were primarily due to increased sales unit volume. For the year ended December 31, 2021, total cost attributed to generating auction marketplace revenue increased to $21.0 million from $11.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and the total cost of generating transportation, data and other services increased to $138.4 million from $72.4 million in year ended December 31, 2020. Direct and allocated personnel and related costs included in auction marketplace increased to $8.5 million for year ended December 31, 2021 from $4.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Non-personnel related costs included in auction marketplace increased to $12.5 million from $6.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Non-personnel related costs included in transportation, data and other services increased to $125.7 million from $62.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The 4% increase in Marketplace and service cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by a higher adoption of our transportation, data, and other services, which carries higher cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue relative to auction marketplace services.\nCustomer Assurance Cost of Revenue\n\nCustomer assurance cost of revenue was $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $15.9 million, or 54%, primarily consisted of costs attributable to our Go Green and other assurance offerings and was primarily driven by increased sales unit volume as compared to prior year, as well as increases in Go Green assurance costs which vary based upon average vehicle value and claims activity. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Go Green assurance cost of revenue increased to $40.4 million from $27.1 million in year ended December 31, 2020, and other assurance cost of revenue increased to $4.9 million from $2.4 million.\nOperations and Technology Expenses\n\nOperations and technology expenses were $101.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $65.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $36.1 million, or 55%, primarily consisted of an increase in personnel and related costs and software and technology expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2021, personnel and related costs increased to $85.4 million from $55.2 million as a result of increased headcount, and software and technology expenses increased to $11.1 million from $6.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of continued investment in our technology and infrastructure.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses were $121.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $64.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $56.3 million, or 87%, primarily consisted of increases in personnel and related costs. For the year ended December 31, 2021, personnel related costs increased to $102.7 million from $56.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of increased headcount, and software and technology expenses increased to $2.8 million from $1.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, other expenses increased to $13.7 million from $5.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from increased advertising and increased insurance expenses related to being a public company.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\nDepreciation and amortization costs were $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, depreciation increased to $2.3 million from $1.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, and amortization of acquired intangible assets increased to $2.0 million from $1.4 million. The remaining year-over-year increase was attributable to amortization of internal-use software costs.\nInterest Income\n\nInterest income decreased to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest Expense\n\nInterest expense on the revolving lines of credit was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $0.5 million for year ended December 31, 2020.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report our financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, provides investors with additional useful information in evaluating our performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, when taken together with our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance and facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations or outlook. In particular, we believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA is helpful to our investors as it is a measure used by management in assessing the health of our business and evaluating our operating performance, as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes.\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations include that: (i) it does not properly reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future; (ii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect these capital expenditures; (iii) it does not consider the impact of stock-based compensation expense; (iv) it does not reflect other non-operating expenses, including interest expense; (v) it does not consider the impact of any contingent consideration liability valuation adjustments; and (vi) it does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us. In addition, our use of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, when evaluating our performance, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial measures, including our net loss and other results stated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented:\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed operations since our inception primarily through our marketplace revenue, borrowings under our debt facilities and the net proceeds we have received from sales of equity securities as further detailed below. In March 2021, we completed our IPO which resulted in aggregate net proceeds of $388.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $566.0 million, and investments in marketable securities totaling $13.8 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months and for the long-term. Our future capital requirements over the long-term will depend on many factors, including volume of sales with existing customers, expansion of sales and marketing activities to acquire new customers, timing and extent of spending to support development efforts and introduction of new and enhanced services. We may, in the future, enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, and technologies. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that we require additional financing, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our principal commitments primarily consist of long-term debt and leases for office space. We have $1.4 million of lease obligations due within a year, and an additional $2.1 million of lease obligations due at various dates through 2027. Refer to Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nIn order to compete successfully and sustain operations at current levels over the next 12 months, we will be required to devote a significant amount of operating cash flow to our human capital in the form of salaries and wages. Additionally, we enter into purchase commitments for goods and services made in the ordinary course of business. These purchase commitments include goods and services received and recorded as liabilities as of\nDecember 31, 2021 as well goods and services which have not yet been delivered or performed and have, therefore, not been reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations. These commitments typically become due after the delivery and completion of such goods or services.\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity to date, we plan to continue to evaluate aspects of our spending, including capital expenditures, discretionary spending, and strategic investments in 2022. We have considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our liquidity and capital resources to date, and we do not currently expect it to impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs or affect our ability to comply with debt covenants. We believe we are well-positioned to manage our business and have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet our cash requirements using available cash and equivalents, investments in marketable securities, and borrowing under our revolving credit facilities.\nA substantial amount of our working capital is generated from the payments received for services which we provide. We settle transactions among buyers and sellers using the marketplace, and as a result the value of the vehicles passes through our balance sheet. Because our receivables typically have been, on average, settled faster than our payables, our cash position at each balance sheet date has been bolstered by marketplace float. Changes in working capital vary from quarter-to-quarter as a result of GMV and the timing of collections and disbursements of funds related to auctions held near period end.\nOur Debt Arrangements\nWe currently have a revolving credit facility with Credit Suisse AG, New York Branch, or the 2019 Revolver, which we entered into in December 2019. We entered into an amendment to the 2019 Revolver on June 25, 2021. We also entered into a revolving credit facility with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., or the 2021 Revolver, on August 24, 2021.\nOne of our wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries, ACV Capital Funding LLC, is the borrower under the 2019 Revolver, which provides for a revolving line of credit in the aggregate amount of up to $50.0 million, with borrowing availability subject to a borrowing base calculated as a percentage of ACV Capital Funding LLC's eligible receivables. The 2019 Revolver is secured by the borrowing base of eligible receivables. In addition, we entered into a separate indemnity agreement in connection with the 2019 Revolver under which we provided an unsecured guaranty of (a) 10% of the outstanding loans under the 2019 Revolver at the time of any event of default and (b) any losses, damages or other expenses incurred by the lenders under the 2019 Revolver, payable in the event of certain specified acts by ACV Capital Funding LLC. The interest rate on any outstanding borrowings is at LIBOR plus 3.75%, subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, and interest payments are payable monthly. The 2019 Revolver has a maturity date of June 25, 2024. The 2019 Revolver also contains customary covenants that limit ACV Capital Funding LLC's ability to enter into indebtedness, make distributions and make investments, among other restrictions. The 2019 Revolver contains a liquidity covenant based on cash on hand, a tangible net worth covenant based on ACV Capital's consolidated net worth, a tangible net worth covenant based on our consolidated net worth, a leverage covenant based on our consolidated leverage and certain other financial covenants tied to ACV Capital's eligible receivables.\nWe are the borrower under the 2021 Revolver, which provides for a revolving line of credit in the aggregate principal amount of up to $160.0 million. The 2021 Revolver also includes a sub facility that provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to $20.0 million outstanding at any time. The 2021 Revolver is guaranteed by substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of our and such subsidiaries' assets. The interest rate applicable to the 2021 Revolver is, at our option, either (a) LIBOR (or a replacement rate established in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement for the 2021 Revolver) (subject to a 0.00% LIBOR floor), plus a margin of 2.75% per annum or (b) the Alternate Base Rate plus a margin of 1.75% per annum. The Alternate Base Rate is the highest of (a) the Wall Street Journal prime rate, (b) the NYFRB rate plus 0.5% and (c)(i) 1.00% plus (ii) the adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period. The 2021 Revolver has a maturity date of August 24, 2026. The 2021 Revolver contains customary covenants that limit our ability to enter into indebtedness, make distributions and make investments, among other restrictions. The 2021 Revolver also contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum liquidity level and achieve specified trailing four quarter revenue targets.\nWe were in compliance with all such applicable covenants as of December 31, 2021, and believe we are in compliance as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2021, we had $0.5 million drawn under the 2019 Revolver, and there was an outstanding letter of credit issued under the 2021 Revolver in the amount of $1.1 million. There were no other amounts outstanding under the 2021 Revolver.\nCash Flows from Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented:\n\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash is cash collection from fees earned on our marketplace services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel expenses, marketing expenses and overhead expenses.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities of $85.3 million was primarily related to our net loss of $78.2 million, adjusted for net cash inflows of $125.9 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, and for non-cash charges of $37.6 million. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, and provision for bad debt. The change in operating assets and liabilities were the result of a $120.2 million increase in accounts receivable and $2.7 million increase in other operating assets, which were offset by a $242.9 million increase in accounts payable and a $5.8 million increase in other current and non-current liabilities.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities of $10.4 million was primarily related to our net loss of $41.0 million, adjusted for net cash inflows $35.4 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, and for non-cash charges of $16.0 million. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, and provision for bad debt, partially offset by contingent gains. The change in operating assets and liabilities were the result of a $29.2 million increase in accounts receivable and $6.4 million increase in other operating assets, which were offset by a $66.2 million increase in accounts payable and a $4.8 million increase in other current and non-current liabilities.\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 relative to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by an increase in marketplace float of $119.2 million. Marketplace float exists when our receivables from Marketplace Buyers are settled faster than our payables to Marketplace Sellers, thereby bolstering our cash flows from operating activities.\nInvesting Activities\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $129.3 million and $19.7 million, respectively, primarily related to capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment to support field and site operations, along with capitalized software development costs to support continued technology innovation, increases in finance receivables, and the use of cash for the acquisition of businesses.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 relative to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by an additional $59.0 million investments in acquisition of businesses in 2021, additional $31.7 million increase in finance receivables, and $13.8 million of investments made in marketable securities.\nFinancing Activities\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $376.2 million and was primarily the result of proceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to the IPO, which were offset by net repayments of long term debt during the period, payments for debt issuance and other financing costs, and the payment of RSU tax withholdings in exchange for shares of common stock surrendered by RSU holders.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $60.8 million and was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of Series E-1 preferred stock and net proceeds from long term debt.\nAcquisitions\nIn the second quarter of 2020, we acquired certain assets from ASI Services LLC, or ASI, for a total purchase consideration of $11.2 million. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method. ASI, headquartered in Cincinnati, OH, was a privately held corporation that primarily focused on providing inspection services for off-lease vehicles to financial institutions. The acquisition of ASI enabled us to expand our position in the used vehicle industry and enhance our service offerings with dealers and commercial partners.\nIn the third quarter of 2021, we completed an acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Max Digital LLC, or Max Digital, for approximately $61.4 million. The total purchase price was paid in cash. The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, the results of the acquired business have been included in our results of operations from the acquisition date. In connection with the acquisition, we incurred approximately $1.1 million of transaction costs. The acquisition of Max Digital enabled us to expand our position in the used vehicle industry and enhance our service offerings with dealers and commercial partners.\nAlso during 2021, we completed other business combinations for total consideration of approximately $6.9 million, net of cash acquired. The transactions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, the results of the acquired business have been included in our results of operations from the respective acquisition dates. These acquisitions enabled us to expand our position in the used vehicle industry and enhance our service offerings between dealers and commercial partners.\nSeasonality\nThe volume of vehicles sold through our auctions generally fluctuates from quarter to quarter. This seasonality is caused by several factors, including holidays, weather, the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles and the timing of federal tax returns, which affects the demand side of the auction industry. As a result, revenue and operating expenses related to volume will fluctuate accordingly on a quarterly basis. In the fourth quarter, we typically experience lower used vehicle auction volume as well as additional costs associated with the holidays. Seasonally depressed used vehicle auction volume typically continues during the winter months through the first quarter. Typical seasonality trends may not be observed in periods where other external factors more significantly impact the industry.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe believe that the following accounting policies involve a high degree of judgement and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our other significant accounting policies. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in those financial statements and accompanying notes. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. Determining whether performance obligations should be accounted for separately or combined may require significant judgment. For each performance obligation within a contract, we evaluate whether we act as the principal or as an agent. When we act as the principal, revenue is recognized in the gross amount of the consideration received from the customer recognized at the point in time the services are completed. When we act as the agent, revenue is recognized net of the consideration due to a third party at the point in time when the services are provided.\nIn contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation proportionately based on the estimated stand-alone selling price, or SSP, of each performance obligation. We use an observable price to determine the SSP for each performance obligation. Where observable prices are not available, an expected cost-plus margin approach is used. We then determine how the services are transferred to the customer to determine the timing of revenue recognition.\nFrom time to time we provide promotions and incentives to buyers and sellers in various forms including discounts on fees, credits and rebates. Promotions and incentives which are consideration payable to a customer are recognized as a reduction of revenue when revenue is recognized.\nCommissions paid to sales representatives and related payroll taxes are considered costs to obtain a contract. Financial Accounting Standard Board Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 340, Other Assets and Deferred Costs, requires costs to obtain a contract with a customer within the scope of Accounting Standards Update No. 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, to be capitalized and amortized over the period of benefit. We have elected the practical expedient available under ASC 340-40-25-4 to immediately expense the incremental cost of obtaining a contract when the underlying related asset would have been amortized over one year or less.\nWe have utilized the practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-50-14 and do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.\nGeneral Guarantees\nWe provide certain guarantees to Sellers in the Marketplace in the ordinary course of business, which are accounted for under ASC 460 as a general guarantee.\nVehicle Condition Guarantees-We offer guarantees to sellers in qualifying situations where we performed a vehicle inspection and prepared the vehicle condition report. The guarantee provides us with the right to retain proceeds from the subsequent liquidation of the vehicle covered under the guarantee. The fair value of vehicle condition guarantees issued is estimated based on historical results and other qualitative factors. The vehicle condition guarantee revenue is recognized on the earlier of the guarantee expiration date or the guarantee settlement date.\nOther Price Guarantees-We provide sellers with a price guarantee for vehicles to be sold on the Marketplace from time to time. If a vehicle sells below the guaranteed price, then we are responsible for paying the Seller the difference between the guaranteed price and the final sale price. The term of the guarantee is typically less than one week.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe use the fair value recognition provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. The estimated fair value of each common stock option award is calculated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Application of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires significant judgment, and involves the use of subjective assumptions including:\n\u2022Expected Term-The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. As we do not have sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term of the stock option awards granted, the simplified method was used to determine the expected term for awards issued to employees.\n\u2022Risk-Free Interest Rate-The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury constant maturity notes with terms approximately equal to the stock-based awards' expected term.\n\u2022Expected Volatility-Since we are newly public and do not have a trading history of common stock, the expected volatility is derived from the average historical stock volatilities of the common stock of several public companies considered to be comparable to us over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock-based awards.\n\u2022Dividend Rate-The expected dividend rate is zero as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.\n\u2022Fair Value of Common Stock-Prior to the IPO, we estimated the fair value of common stock. Our board of directors, with input from management, considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock at each meeting in which award were approved. Subsequent to the IPO, the fair value of the underlying common stock is determined by the closing price, on the date of grant, of the Company's Class A common stock, which is traded publicly on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nWe measure all stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees, directors, consultants and other nonemployees based on the fair value on the date of the grant. The options vest based on a graded scale over the stated vesting period, and compensation expense is recognized based on their grant date fair value on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\nThe fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are determined based on the estimated market price of our common stock on the grant date. The awards and units vest over time and compensation expense is recognized based on their grant fair value ratably over the requisite service period.\nWe classify stock-based compensation expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same way the payroll costs or service payments are classified for the related stock-based award recipient.\nInternal-Use Software Costs\nWe capitalize internal-use software costs during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. This software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, generally three years. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, or more frequently when warranted.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives. We evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is subject to an impairment test.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as one singular reporting unit on October 1 or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our policy is to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely or not that the reporting unit's carrying value is less than its fair value, indicating the potential for goodwill impairment. If the reporting unit fails the qualitative test, then we proceed with a quantitative test. We then determine whether the reporting unit fair value\nis less than its carrying amount, and if it is, we recognize a goodwill impairment equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period under the JOBS Act for the adoption of certain accounting standards until the earlier of the date we (1) are no longer an emerging growth company or (2) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.", "item_7_tables": "Table 7:

</tr>\n</table>", "summary": " Here is a summary of the key points from the MD&A report:\n\nOverview\n- ACV provides an online marketplace and data services for wholesale vehicle transactions. It generates revenue primarily from fees earned when vehicles are successfully auctioned on its marketplace.\n\n- In 2021, ACV sold 560,959 vehicles on its marketplace representing $7.9 billion in gross merchandise value. Revenue was $358.4 million, net loss was $78.2 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $(44.1) million.\n\nImpact of COVID-19\n- COVID-19 disrupted operations in early 2020 but demand rebounded strongly starting in May 2020. Supply constraints in 2021 limited vehicle inventory but used car prices remain high. The pandemic could still create volatility in ACV's business.  \n\nRevenue \n- Marketplace revenue was $308.4 million in 2021, up 78% driven by higher auction volume and fees. Customer assurance revenue rose 42% to $50.1 million.\n\nExpenses\n- Costs of revenue, operations, technology and SG&A expenses rose 91%, 55% and 87% respectively in 2021, driven primarily by volume-based variable costs and investments in personnel, infrastructure and advertising.  \n\nProfitability\n- Net loss widened to $78.2 million in 2021 from $41 million in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA loss increased to $44.1 million. Continued investment in growth is impacting near term profitability.\n\nLiquidity & Cash Flow\n- ACV completed an IPO in March 2021, raising $388.9 million. It had $566 million in cash at December 31, 2021 and $160 million in available revolver capacity. Cash from operations was $85.3 million."}
