MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Overview\nGeneral\nOur principal business is reliably providing wholesale electric service to our 38 members in a safe and cost-effective manner. Consequently, substantially all of our revenues and cash flow are derived from sales to our members pursuant to take-or-pay wholesale power contracts that extend through 2050. These contracts obligate our members jointly and severally to pay all of our costs and expenses associated with owning and operating our power supply business. To that end, our rate structure provides for a pass-through of actual energy costs. Charges for fixed costs, including capacity, other non-energy charges, debt service obligations and the margin required to meet our budgeted margins for interest ratio are carefully managed throughout the year to ensure that we collect sufficient capacity-related revenues. Our rate structure provides us with the ability to manage our revenues to assure full recovery of our costs and has enabled us consistently to meet our financial obligations since our formation in 1974.\n2020 Financial Results\nDespite the challenges and uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we had another successful year in 2020 and continue to be well positioned, both financially and operationally, to fulfill our obligations to our members, bondholders and creditors. Our revenues were more than sufficient to recover all of our costs and to satisfy all of our debt service obligations and financial covenants. Specifically, we recorded a net margin of $55.9 million in 2020, which achieved the 1.14 margins for interest ratio approved by our board of directors and exceeded the 1.10 margins for interest ratio required to meet the rate covenant under our first mortgage indenture. For 2021, we are again targeting a margins for interest ratio of 1.14, effectively increasing our annual margins by 40% over the minimum required level. We anticipate that we will continue to target a 1.14 margins for interest ratio through the remainder of the Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 construction period.\nAs a result of expanding our generation capacity and upgrading our generation facilities over the past decade, our total assets and total debt have significantly increased. At December 31, 2020, our total assets were $14.2 billion and total long-term debt was $10.6 billion. During the remainder of the Vogtle construction period, we expect that our assets and long-term debt will continue to increase. However, strategic financing and refinancing of capital investments with long-term debt through the Department of Energy and Rural Utilities Service loan guarantee programs, taxable and tax-exempt capital markets offerings and a continued low interest rate environment enabled us to borrow long-term debt at our lowest interest rates to date during 2020 and further decreased our weighted average interest cost on long-term debt from 5.41% per year at December 31, 2009 to 3.73% per year at December 31, 2020. We will continue to actively manage our debt portfolio and utilize advantageous borrowing programs available to us as our ability to borrow at lower costs ultimately benefits our members and their customers as interest savings are reflected in our pass-through rate structure.\nVogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4\nThe construction of Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 continues to be a primary focus area. Our current budget for our 30% ownership interest in these units is $7.5 billion, which includes capital costs, allowance for funds used during construction, our allocation of the project-level contingency and a separate Oglethorpe-level contingency. As of December 31, 2020, our total investment in the additional Vogtle units was $6.0 billion. The Georgia Public Service Commission approved in-service dates for Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 are November 2021 and November 2022, respectively.\nConstruction continues to make significant progress at the site and a number of important construction, system turnover and testing milestones were achieved during 2020. Southern Nuclear and Georgia Power continue to manage the construction at the site and maintained operations throughout 2020 while implementing comprehensive mitigation measures to manage the impact of COVID-19 at the site. Although construction activities continued, workforce disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing productivity challenges which have continued into 2021. As a result of these challenges, Southern Nuclear has further extended certain milestone dates, including the start of hot functional testing and fuel load for Unit No. 3. The Unit No. 3 schedule is challenged, and while the ability to achieve the November 2021 regulatory in-service date remains a target for Southern Nuclear, we believe a delay is likely which could add a month or more to the Unit No. 3\nin-service date. As Unit No. 3 approaches hot functional testing, key factors impacting the schedule include both the pace of work package completion and system turnovers, and required construction remediation work.\nAchievement of the November 2022 regulatory in-service date for Unit No. 4 primarily depends on overall construction productivity and production levels significantly improving as well as appropriate levels of craft laborers, particularly electrical and pipefitter craft labor, being added and maintained. In the event that there is any schedule extension beyond the November 2021 and November 2022 regulatory in-service dates for Units No. 3 and No. 4, respectively, the Oglethorpe-level contingency level in our current $7.5 billion budget is expected to be sufficient to withstand up to a 4-month delay for Unit No. 3 and a 3-month delay for Unit No. 4. Any further delays beyond these extended dates are expected to impact our cost by approximately $55 million per month for both units and approximately $25 million per month for Unit No. 4 only, including financing costs.\nUpon completion, Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 will have an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 2,200 megawatts and our 30% undivided interest will entitle us to approximately 660 megawatts of carbon-free, baseload generating capacity. We expect these units to be valuable assets for us and our members over the next 60 to 80 years and to contribute to our diverse pool of generation resources. For additional information regarding Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 and related financing activities, see BUSINESS - OUR POWER SUPPLY RESOURCES - Future Power Resources - Plant Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4,\u201d - Financial Condition - Financing Activities - Department of Energy-Guaranteed Loans\u201d and - Capital Requirements - Capital Expenditures\u201d and Note 7a of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCOVID-19\nWe were able to successfully navigate the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 and are proud of our associates' response to the outbreak. As an electric utility, we are deemed part of the nation's critical infrastructure and continued operating during the pandemic to provide electricity to our members and the populations they serve. To protect our associates and the public and to maintain operating capabilities, we implemented applicable business continuity plans, including working remotely where possible; increased cleaning frequency at business locations; implemented applicable safety and health guidelines issued by federal and state officials; and established protocols to maintain generation reliability. In June, we began a phased reopening of our corporate offices with new safety protocols intended to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19. To date, these measures have been effective in maintaining our critical operations and we continue to keep in contact with state and federal regulators to ensure the safety of our associates and reliability of our generation facilities.\nWhile there were temporary disruptions in the capital and equity markets over the course of the year, the COVID pandemic did not have a significant effect on our business operations or financial condition. For 2020, our analysis indicates that the impact of COVID-19 on our members' sales was approximately one percent. The potential decrease in sales was mitigated by the fact that approximately two-thirds of our members' sales are to residential customers. Further, although our members were subject to an increased risk that their consumers may not be able to pay utility bills on time or may seek to enter into alternative payment plans, our members have continued to pay all amounts due under the wholesale power contracts on a timely basis and we are not aware of a significant increase of bad debt with any of our members. While we are encouraged by the increasing distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines, the ultimate impact of the pandemic on us and our members remains subject to many factors, including the timing of achieving a sufficient level of vaccinations and the remaining duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions.\nLiquidity Position\nOur strong liquidity position continues to be one of the most positive attributes contributing to our solid financial standing. This liquidity is comprised of a diversified, cost-effective mix of cash (including short-term investments), committed lines of credit and commercial paper. Our primary source of liquidity is a $1.2 billion unsecured credit facility that extends through December 2024 and supports our commercial paper program. Additionally, we have three other bank credit facilities which provide another $613 million in credit commitments, including a $363 million line of credit from J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, which we increased from $150 million in March 2020.\nIn addition to our strong liquidity, we have multiple sources of long-term financing available to meet our anticipated capital needs. These sources include Department of Energy and Rural Utilities Service federal loan programs and the taxable\nand tax-exempt capital markets. We expect to continue utilizing each of these sources of capital to meet our long-term financing needs in the coming years.\nWith our current sources of committed short-term and long-term funding, we anticipate that we will have sufficient liquidity to complete Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nAnother of our key focus areas is maintaining compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulatory standards. We own electric generation facilities powered by nuclear, natural gas, coal and hydro resources which presents substantial challenges for us and our members to comply with existing environmental regulations. Based on the new presidential administration's executive orders, statements regarding reducing carbon dioxide emissions and decision to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, we expect existing environmental regulations to become more stringent. As an electric cooperative that operates on a not-for-profit basis, our compliance costs are ultimately borne by our members' electricity consumers.\nGreenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, are again the focus of increased federal environmental regulations. Effective February 19, 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement and will develop proposed reductions in carbon dioxide which could lead to legislative and regulatory actions to support those goals. The EPA is expected to undertake a new rulemaking process to address carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants following the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's decision to vacate and remand the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule. At this time we cannot predict the outcome or potential cost of any legislative or regulatory changes on us or our members but it could be significant. We also believe that we are well-situated to effectively manage such challenges and that our diverse asset base, along with our investment in additional carbon-free generation at Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4, positions us well to continue to meet our members' needs. Further, our members continue to pursue renewable generation opportunities and invest where they deem appropriate in order to further diversify their power supply resources to meet the demands of their member consumers and prepare for potential future limitations on greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn addition to greenhouse gases, we must also comply with several other environmental regulations. For example, in order to comply with federal and state coal combustion residual rules and effluent limitation guidelines, we are investing approximately $289 million in capital costs, of which $242 million has already been spent, in addition to $400 million to $550 million (in year of expenditure dollars) associated with our corresponding asset retirement obligations. If existing laws or regulations related to the disposal of CCR and treatment of coal ash ponds were to change or we are otherwise required to revise our existing closure plans, our related obligations could increase materially.\nAsset Management\nAnother of our primary focus areas continues to be ensuring that our owned and operated generation facilities perform in the most efficient and cost-effective manner possible and, in 2021, we will continue to seek ways to improve the reliability of our generating facilities. Our Operational Excellence program strives to achieve safety, reliability and compliance in a cost effective manner. Many of the generation facilities we operate rank in the top quartile of similar plants in one or more key performance indicators, including start reliability, peak season availability and forced outages. Additionally, our generation assets are built and designed to operate in extreme winter weather. Following the 2014 polar vortex, we implemented design improvements across our fleet of power plants to safeguard against subzero temperatures and ensure reliable generation resources for our members. Achieving operational excellence results in the most reliable, efficient and lowest cost power supply for our members; therefore, effective asset management will always be one of our top priorities.\nAs we assess the operation of our existing generation resources, a continued trend in the dispatch of our generation assets is the significant decrease in coal-fired generation. The percentage of energy from coal generation that we supply to our members has decreased from 45% in 2008 to 5% in 2020. The two primary drivers of this shift in generation were our acquisition of additional natural gas-fired resources and a significant fall in natural gas prices. As a result of this trend and capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations, Georgia Power is evaluating whether to retire Plant Wansley Units No. 1 and No. 2 as early as fall 2022. As we look ahead, we continue to consider the role that coal-fired generation resources play in our overall portfolio and the ability to provide reliable and cost-effective generation for our members.\nIn addition to our current assets, we continue to evaluate potential resources to meet our members' needs at the lowest reasonable cost. On March 1, 2021, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire Effingham County Power, a 511-megawatt natural gas-fired combined cycle peaking facility that is subject to customary closing terms and conditions. If completed, this acquisition would provide an additional efficient and economically priced generation resource to our members.\nRate Management Programs\nOver the last five years, our average wholesale power rate to our members has been at or below the mid-six cents per kilowatt-hour range. Given the magnitude of the Vogtle project, we and some of our members have voluntarily implemented various rate management programs to smooth out the impact on rates when Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 reach commercial operation.\nBeginning in 2018, we offered our members an optional rate management program allowing for an election of additional collections of future expenses for a five-year period which will then be applied to billings over the subsequent five-year period. For participating members, the additional collections will have the effect of gradually increasing their payments to us over the initial five year period, 2018 to 2022, in order to soften the impact of full integration of the new Vogtle units' costs into rates. In 2023 to 2025, the first few full years after expected commercial operation of the Vogtle units, we will apply a portion of the additional amounts collected to participating members' bills, which we expect to reduce the rate impact to those members by approximately one-half of a cent each year, from the mid-seven cents per kilowatt-hour range to around seven cents per kilowatt-hour. The impact of the program will gradually decrease through 2027, its final year. Further, because we only supply around 60% of our members' wholesale power requirements, the ultimate rate impact on the retail consumers may be further mitigated as our members' rates are blended with their supplemental power supply sources, transmission and retail distribution costs.\nOutlook for 2021\nAs the electric utility industry across the country continues to experience change, we remain focused on providing reliable, safe, and cost-effective energy to our members and the 4.3 million people they serve and believe we are well positioned to do so. As discussed above, there are certain risks and challenges that we must continue to address, most notably related to Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 and anticipated environmental regulation. However, as we manage our risks, we intend to keep doing what we have done so successfully for the last 47 years, including, among other things:\n\u2022maintaining a balanced and diverse portfolio of generating resources, including nuclear, natural gas, coal and hydro and continuing the efficient and cost-effective operation of these resources;\n\u2022maintaining strong liquidity to fulfill current obligations and to finance future capital expenditures; and\n\u2022working with our members to explore existing and emerging opportunities to add value to our ultimate consumers.\nAccounting Policies\nBasis of Accounting\nWe follow generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and the practices prescribed in the Uniform System of Accounts of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as modified and adopted by the Rural Utilities Service.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe have determined that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations and requires our management to make estimates and assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time of the preparation of our financial statements. Changes in these estimates and assumptions by our management could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition. Our management has discussed these critical accounting policies and the related estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of our board of directors.\nRegulatory Accounting. We are subject to the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) authoritative guidance issued regarding regulated operations. The guidance permits us to record regulatory assets and\nregulatory liabilities to reflect future cost recoveries or refunds, respectively, that we have a right to pass through to our members. At December 31, 2020, our regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities totaled $731.4 million and $566.4 million, respectively. While we do not currently foresee any events such as competition or other factors that would make it not probable that we will recover these costs from our members as future revenues through rates under our wholesale power contracts, if such an event were to occur, we could no longer apply the provisions of accounting for regulated operations, which would require us to eliminate all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities that had been recognized as a charge or credit to our statement of revenues and expenses and begin recognizing assets and liabilities in a manner similar to other businesses in general. In addition, we would be required to determine any impairment to other assets, including plants, and write-down those assets, if impaired, to their fair values.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. Accounting for asset retirement and environmental obligations requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at fair value when incurred and capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset. In the absence of quoted market prices, we estimate the fair value of our asset retirement obligations using present value techniques, in which estimates of future cash flows associated with retirement activities are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures includes, among other things, making projections of when assets will be retired and ultimately decommissioned, the amount of decommissioning costs, and how costs will escalate with inflation.\nA significant portion of our asset retirement obligations relates to our share of the future cost to decommission our operating nuclear units and the coal ash ponds at our coal-fired units. At December 31, 2020, our nuclear decommissioning and coal ash related asset retirement obligations were $738.2 million and $346.6 million, respectively. Our asset retirement obligations represent an estimate of the present value of anticipated retirement costs. For additional detail regarding our asset retirement obligations, see Note 1h of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These obligations represented 95% of our total asset retirement obligations.\nGiven its significance, we consider our nuclear decommissioning liabilities critical estimates. Approximately every three years, new decommissioning studies for Plants Hatch and Vogtle are performed. These studies provide us with periodic site-specific \"base year\" cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost and timing of planned decommissioning activities for the plants. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows for extended periods are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual costs. In addition, these estimates are dependent on subjective factors, including the selection of cost escalation and discount rates, which we consider to be critical assumptions. Our current estimates are based upon studies that were performed in 2018. For ratemaking purposes, we record decommissioning costs over the expected service life of each unit. The impact on measurements of asset retirement obligations using different assumptions in the future may be significant.\nWe also consider our coal ash related decommissioning liabilities at Plants Scherer and Wansley to be critical estimates, in particular those for the coal ash ponds. Cost studies are periodically performed to provide site-specific \"base year\" estimates that determine the nature and timing of planned decommissioning costs. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows for extended periods are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual costs. Critical assumptions include coal ash pond closure strategy, including water treatment requirements, and the volume of coal ash in the ponds. In addition, these estimates are dependent on other subjective factors, such as estimates of costs to perform the decommissioning and post-closure activities, timing of expenditures, and the selection of cost escalation and discount rates. Our current estimates are based upon studies that were performed in 2019. For ratemaking purposes, we are applying regulated operations accounting to the decommissioning costs and currently expect to recover ash pond closure costs over approximately 12 years. The impact on measurements of asset retirement obligations using different assumptions in the future may be significant.\nRecently issued or adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\u201d. The amendments in this update apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The amendments in this update provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments in this update do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for hedging\nrelationships existing as of December 31, 2022, for which an entity has elected certain optional expedients that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship.\nIn January 2021, the FASB issued Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope,\u201d to further clarify the scope of the reference rate reform guidance in Topic 848. The amendments in this update refine the scope of Topic 848 to clarify that certain optional expedients and exceptions therein for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to contracts that are affected by the discounting transition. Specifically, modifications related to reference rate reform would not be considered an event that requires reassessment of previous accounting conclusions. The amendments in this update also amend the expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 to capture the incremental consequences of the scope clarification and to tailor the existing guidance to derivative instruments affected by the discounting transition.\nThe amendments in these updates are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating the future impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued \"Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\" The standard was effective for us prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods therein. On January 1, 2020, we adopted this standard. The standard requires consideration of a broad range of information to estimate expected credit losses over the lifetime of financial assets measured at amortized cost. The new credit losses standard replaced the incurred loss\u201d methodology for recognizing credit losses that delayed recognition until it was probable a loss had been incurred. The financial assets we hold that are subject to the new standard are predominately accounts receivable and certain cash equivalents classified as held-to-maturity debt (e.g. commercial paper). Our receivables are generally due within thirty days or less with a significant portion related to billings to our members. See Notes 1e and 1f for information regarding our member receivables. Commercial paper issuances we invest in are rated as investment grade and backed by a credit facility. Given our historical experience, the short duration lifetime of these financial assets and the short time horizon over which to consider expectations of future economic conditions, we have assessed that non-collection of the cost basis of these financial assets is remote. The adoption of the standard did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued \"Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.\" This standard eliminated, added and modified certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements as part of the FASB's disclosure framework project. Entities are no longer required to disclose the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the policy for timing of transfers between levels and the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. However, public business entities are required to disclose the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. The amendments in this update were effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. An entity was permitted to early adopt any removed or modified disclosures upon issuance of this update and delay adoption of the additional disclosures until their effective date. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\u201d, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in the accounting standards. The amendments in the standard remove certain exceptions and also clarify and simplify various aspects of accounting for income taxes. The new standard is effective for us prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted, which we are not electing to do. The adoption of the standard on January 1, 2021 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nSummary of Cooperative Operations\nSources of Revenues\nWe operate on a not-for-profit basis and, accordingly, seek only to generate revenues sufficient to recover our cost of service and to generate margins sufficient to establish reasonable reserves and meet certain financial coverage requirements. Our primary source of revenue is the sale of capacity and energy to our members for a portion of their energy requirements. We may also sell capacity and energy to non-members. Capacity revenues are the revenues we receive for providing electric service whether or not our generation and purchased power resources are dispatched to produce electricity. Energy revenues are the revenues we receive by selling electricity that we generate or purchase.\nWe have assigned fixed percentage capacity cost responsibilities to our members for all of our generation and purchased power resources. Each member has contractually agreed to pay us for the electric capacity assigned to it based on its individual fixed percentage capacity cost responsibility.\nEach member is also contractually obligated to pay us for electric energy we provide to it based on individual usage. Energy sales to our members fluctuate from period to period based on several factors, including fuel costs, weather and other seasonal factors, load requirements in the service territories of our members, operating costs, availability of electric generation resources and our decisions of whether to dispatch our owned or purchased resources or member-owned resources over which we have dispatch rights. In addition, as we do not provide our members with all of their energy requirements, energy sales may also fluctuate based on our members' decisions of whether to purchase a portion of their hourly energy requirements from our resources or from other suppliers.\nFormulary Rate\nThe rates we charge our members are designed to cover all of our costs plus a margin. This cost-plus rate structure is set forth as a formula in the rate schedule to the wholesale power contracts between us and each of our members. These contracts require us to design capacity and energy rates that generate revenues sufficient to recover all costs, including payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, to establish and maintain reasonable margins and to meet the financial coverage requirements under the first mortgage indenture.\nThe formulary rate provides for the pass through of our fixed costs to members as capacity charges and our variable costs to members as energy charges. Fixed costs are assigned to members according to their individual fixed percentage capacity cost responsibility for each resource in which they participate. Variable costs are passed through to our members based on the amount of energy supplied to each member.\nCapacity charges are based on an annual budget of fixed costs plus a targeted margin and are billed to members in equal monthly installments over the course of the year. Fixed costs include items such as depreciation, interest, fixed operations and maintenance expenses, administrative and general expenses. We monitor fixed cost budget variances to projected actual costs throughout the year, and with board approval, make budget adjustments when and as necessary to ensure that we generate revenues sufficient to recover all costs and to meet our targeted margin. Budget adjustments are typically made twice a year; once during the first quarter and again at year end. In contrast to the way we bill our members for capacity charges, which are billed based on a budget and trued up to actuals by the end of the year, energy charges are billed on a more real-time basis. Estimated energy charges are billed to members based on the amount of energy supplied to each member during the month, and are adjusted when actual costs are available, generally the following month. Energy charges, or variable costs, include fuel, purchased energy and variable operations and maintenance expenses. Each generating resource has a different variable cost profile, and members are billed based on the energy cost profile of the resources from which their energy is supplied.\nMargins\nRevenues in excess of current period costs in any year are designated as net margin in our statements of revenues and expenses and we have generated a positive net margin every year since our formation in 1974. Under our first mortgage indenture, we are required, subject to any necessary regulatory approval, to establish and collect rates that are reasonably expected, together with our other revenues, to yield a margins for interest ratio for each fiscal year equal to at least 1.10. See \"BUSINESS - OGLETHORPE POWER CORPORATION - First Mortgage Indenture\" for a discussion of how we calculate our margins for interest ratio.\nIn the event we were to fall short of the minimum 1.10 margins for interest ratio at year end, the formulary rate is designed to recover the shortfall from our members in the following year without any additional action by our board of directors.\nPrior to 2009, we budgeted and achieved annual margins for interest ratios of 1.10, the minimum required by the first mortgage indenture. To enhance margin coverage during a period of increased capital requirements, our board of directors has approved budgets with margins for interest ratios that exceeded 1.10. Since 2010, we have achieved our board approved margins for interest ratio of 1.14, and our board has approved a margins for interest ratio of 1.14 for 2021. As our capital requirements continue to evolve, our board will continue to evaluate the level of margin coverage and may choose to change the targeted margins for interest ratio in the future, although not below 1.10.\nPatronage Capital\nRetained net margins are designated on our balance sheets as patronage capital. As a cooperative, patronage capital constitutes our principal equity. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.1 billion in patronage capital and membership fees. Our equity ratio, calculated pursuant to our first mortgage indenture as patronage capital and membership fees divided by total capitalization and long-term debt due within one year, was 9.1% and 9.4% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nPatronage capital is allocated to each of our members on the basis of their fixed percentage capacity responsibilities in our generation resources. Any distribution of patronage capital is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and limitations under our first mortgage indenture. See \"BUSINESS - OGLETHORPE POWER CORPORATION - First Mortgage Indenture\" for a discussion regarding limitations on distributions under our first mortgage indenture.\nRate Regulation\nUnder our loan agreements with each of the Rural Utilities Service and Department of Energy, changes to our rates resulting from adjustments in our annual budget are generally not subject to their approval. We must provide the Rural Utilities Service and Department of Energy with a notice of and opportunity to object to most changes to the formulary rate under the wholesale power contracts. See \"BUSINESS - OGLETHORPE POWER CORPORATION - Relationship with Federal Lenders.\" Currently, our rates are not subject to the approval of any other federal or state agency or authority, including the Georgia Public Service Commission.\nTax Status\nWhile we are a not-for-profit membership corporation formed under the laws of Georgia, we are subject to federal and state income taxation. As a taxable cooperative, we are allowed to deduct patronage dividends that we allocate to our members for purposes of calculating our taxable income. We annually allocate income and deductions between patronage and non-patronage activities and substantially all of our income is from patronage-sourced activities, resulting in no current period income tax expense or current income tax liability. For further discussion of our taxable status, see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nFactors Affecting Results\nCertain of our recent financial and operational results were affected both by the way in which we dispatch our power plants as well as by significant events or trends described below.\nWe have a diverse mix of generation and fuel types among our power plants, allowing us to serve the power needs of our members in a reliable, efficient and low-cost manner. The types of generation assets we own include several natural gas-fired simple cycle combustion turbine plants, two combined cycle natural gas-fired plants, a plant that burns bituminous coal, a plant that burns sub-bituminous coal, two nuclear plants and a pumped storage hydroelectric plant.\nDecisions to dispatch our power plants and thus the amount of energy we generate and sell to our members are economically driven by supply and demand considerations. The primary supply considerations include (i) fuel prices and other marginal operating costs of the plant, which factor into a dispatch cost we calculate for each resource, (ii) plant availability, which is driven by factors such as outages for maintenance or refuelings and (iii) plant efficiency, as determined by the heat rate which measures the amount of fuel required to generate one kilowatt hour of electricity. We prioritize the order in which we dispatch our plants such that we dispatch our available plants with the lowest dispatch cost first, and those with the highest dispatch cost last, when demand is highest. The primary demand consideration that affects how we dispatch our plants is the amount of energy our members require from us. This is a function of weather, economic activity, residential use patterns and the relative cost and availability of our members' third party supply arrangements, which account for a significant portion of the energy they purchase. In 2020, our energy generation and member sales were down by approximately 5% when compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to milder weather in the winter and summer, with only about 1% related to reduced demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSince we pass through all of our costs to members, including fuel cost, which is one of our most significant operating costs, the cost of our energy sales to our members is significantly affected by fuel prices. The price of natural gas is the most\nsignificant variable in our cost of fuel and also affects how we dispatch our generation resources. Natural gas prices were relatively low in 2018 and 2019, and continued to trend downward in 2020. In addition to the prevailing market price, our average cost of natural gas per kilowatt hour generated is also affected by how efficiently our natural gas facilities burn the gas. Compared to our combined cycle units, our combustion turbine units are less efficient and thus burn more gas per kilowatt hour of electricity generated. Consequently, our combustion turbine units have a higher dispatch cost than our combined cycle units and are typically used to generate energy only during periods of higher electricity demand, such as on hot summer days. In 2020, generation from our combustion turbine units was less than in 2019 due to the aforementioned mild weather.\nAs a result of the low natural gas price environment, our coal units have become less economical and are generating less energy to sell to our members. In 2020, generation from our coal units was 5% of our gross total energy generation compared to 10% in 2019 and 16% in 2018.\nOur nuclear units require refueling on an 18 to 24-month cycle and these refueling outages, which typically last several weeks, resulted in fluctuations in nuclear plant availability and generation in each of the last three years. These shutdowns and outages significantly reduced generation at the affected plants, reduced kilowatt-hour sales to and energy revenues from our members during the periods that the plants were not generating power.\nOur energy sales to our members also fluctuate from period to period based on weather. For 2020, the winter was very mild and summer was moderately milder when compared to the prior ten year average. The mild weather largely contributed to the decrease in energy sales in 2020 compared to 2019. However, in July our members experienced a peak just short of the all-time peak demand that occurred in August 2019. This was a result of warmer than normal weather in July combined with many of our members' residential customers working remotely from home and commercial loads returning to pre-COVID-19 levels.\nWe also continued to make significant capital expenditures over the past three years, particularly for the new units under construction at Plant Vogtle, which we have primarily financed with debt. These financings have increased our overall debt which has increased our interest expense and our allowance for debt funds used during construction. Additionally, since our margin is calculated as a percentage of our secured interest expense, our net margin has generally increased. As discussed under \"- Financial Condition - Capital Resources - Capital Expenditures,\" we expect significant capital expenditures to continue through the completion of the additional units at Plant Vogtle.\nNet Margin\nOur net margin for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $55.9 million, $54.5 million and $51.2 million, respectively. These amounts produced a margins for interest ratio of 1.14 in each of 2020, 2019 and 2018. For additional information on our margin requirement, see \"- Summary of Cooperative Operations - Rate Regulation.\"\nOperating Revenues\nSales to Members. We generate revenues principally from the sale of electric capacity and energy to our members. Capacity revenues are the revenues we receive for electric service whether or not our generation and purchased power resources are dispatched to produce electricity. These revenues are designed to recover the fixed costs associated with our business, including fixed production expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses and interest charges, plus a targeted margin. Energy revenues are the sales of electricity generated or purchased for our members. Energy revenues recover the variable costs of our business, including fuel, purchased energy and variable operation and maintenance expense.\nThe components of member revenues were as follows:\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> <td>2019 vs. 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td>2019 </td> <td>2018 </td> <td>% Change </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capacity revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>971,071 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>942,057 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>927,419 </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy revenues </td> <td>405,939 </td> <td> </td> <td>487,795 </td> <td> </td> <td>551,960 </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td>(11.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,377,010 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,429,852 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,479,379 </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.7) </td> <td>% </td> <td>(3.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>kWh Sales </td> <td>22,187,311 </td> <td> </td> <td>23,225,861 </td> <td> </td> <td>23,011,079 </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cents/kWh </td> <td>6.21 </td> <td> </td> <td>6.16 </td> <td> </td> <td>6.43 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td>(4.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Member energy requirements supplied </td> <td>57 </td> <td>% </td> <td>58 </td> <td>% </td> <td>57 </td> <td>% </td> <td>(1.7) </td> <td>% </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapacity revenues increased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the recovery of higher fixed production costs. The slight increase in capacity revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 was due primarily to the recovery of depreciation and accretion expenses. For a discussion of production costs and depreciation and accretion expense, see \"- Operating Expenses.\"\nThe 16.8% decrease in energy revenues from members in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily a result of a decrease in total fuel expense, including a decrease in generation for member sales. Energy revenues from members in 2019 compared to 2018 decreased 11.6% due to a decrease in total fuel expense, offset by a slight increase in generation for member sales. For a discussion of fuel expense, see \"- Operating Expenses.\"\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses decreased 4.4% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to a decline in fuel costs, and offset by an increase in production costs. In 2019 compared to 2018, operating expenses decreased 3.4% primarily due to a decline in fuel costs, offset by an increase in depreciation and accretion.\nThe following table summarizes our net

result of lower natural gas prices, which also contributed to a shift in generation from coal-fired plants to more economical natural gas-fired plants. Included in total fuel expense were $20.3 million of losses in 2020 and $9.1 million of losses in 2019 incurred for the settlement of natural gas financial contracts we utilize to manage our exposure to fluctuations in market prices. Total generation increased slightly in 2019 compared to 2018.\nProduction costs can vary due to the number and extent of outages in a given year. Production costs increased 4.3% in 2020 compared to 2019 and decreased 1.7% in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in 2020 was due to planned major maintenance outages at Plant Smith during the year. The decrease in 2019 was due to a reduction in fixed and variable maintenance costs driven by outages during the prior year.\nOther Income\nTotal other income decreased 21.0% in 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of lower investment balances and lower interest rates. The 6.0% decrease in other income in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to losses realized on the retirement of certain leasehold improvements.\nInterest Charges\nAllowance for debt funds used during construction increased in 2020 and 2019 primarily due to increased borrowings or Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 construction expenditures.\nFinancial Condition\nOverview\nConsistent with our budgeted margin for 2020, we achieved a 1.14 margins for interest ratio which produced a net margin of $55.9 million. This net margin increased our total patronage capital (our equity) and membership fees to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2020. Our 2021 budget again targets a 1.14 margins for interest ratio.\nOur equity to total capitalization ratio, as defined in our first mortgage indenture, was 9.1% at December 31, 2020 and 9.4% at December 31, 2019. We anticipate that our equity ratio will remain around its current level during the remainder of the Vogtle construction period; however, the absolute level of patronage capital will continue to increase.\nWe had a strong liquidity position at December 31, 2020 with $1.6 billion of unrestricted available liquidity, including $405.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. We issued commercial paper throughout the year to provide interim financing for the Plant Vogtle construction and for other purposes at a low cost. The average cost of funds on the $383.5 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2020 was 0.3%.\nOur total assets increased to $14.2 billion at December 31, 2020 from $13.0 billion at December 31, 2019. For the past several years, our total assets have shown significant increases due to increases in construction work in progress in connection with the additional nuclear units under construction at Plant Vogtle.\nProperty additions during 2020 totaled $1.3 billion. These additions include costs related to the construction of the new Vogtle units, environmental control facilities being installed at coal-fired Plants Scherer and Wansley, normal additions and replacements to existing generation facilities and purchases of nuclear fuel.\nThere was a net increase in long-term debt and finance leases of $887.3 million at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. The weighted average interest rate on the $10.6 billion of long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 was 3.73%.\nSources of Capital and Liquidity\nSources of Capital. We fund our capital requirements through a combination of funds generated from operations and short-term and long-term borrowings. See \"- Capital Requirements - Capital Expenditures\" for more detailed information regarding our estimated capital expenditures.\nWe have $4.6 billion of loans from the Federal Financing Bank that are guaranteed by the Department of Energy. These loans provide funding for a portion of our cost to construct our 30% interest in the two new nuclear units at Plant Vogtle. As of December 31, 2020, we had $3.6 billion outstanding under these loans and may draw the remaining amounts through November 2023.\nHistorically, we have also obtained a substantial portion of our long-term financing from Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed loans funded by the Federal Financing Bank. However, Rural Utilities Service funding levels for projects we may choose to undertake are uncertain and may be limited in the future due to budgetary and political pressures faced by Congress. Because of these factors, we cannot predict the amount or cost of Rural Utilities Service loans that may be available to us in the future.\nWe have also issued a substantial amount of taxable and tax-exempt debt in the capital markets. If the Rural Utilities Service loan program were to be curtailed or eliminated or if we are unable to draw the full amount of the Department of Energy-guaranteed loan, we believe we are well positioned to continue to access capital market financings. See \"- Financing Activities\" for more detailed information regarding our financing plans.\nSee Note 7 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these loans.\nSee \"BUSINESS - OGLETHORPE POWER CORPORATION - Relationship with Federal Lenders\" for further discussion of our relationship with the Department of Energy and Rural Utilities Service.\nLiquidity. At December 31, 2020, we had $1.6 billion of unrestricted available liquidity to meet short-term cash needs and liquidity requirements, consisting of $405.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.2 billion of unused and available committed credit arrangements.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $511.4 million in 2020, and averaged $450.8 million per year for the three-year period 2018 through 2020.\nWe monitor our anticipated liquidity needs to ensure that our credit facility portfolio appropriately covers our anticipated needs. In March 2020, we amended our $150 million line of credit with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank to increase the commitment to $363 million, and used this line of credit, and subsequently commercial paper, to temporarily finance the purchase of $212.8 million of pollution control bonds that were subject to mandatory tender on April 1, 2020. In August 2020 we remarketed the pollution control bonds and used the proceeds to repay these borrowings. See \"- Financing Activities - Bond Financings\" for more detailed information regarding these pollution control bonds.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $1.8 billion of committed credit arrangements in place and $1.2 billion available under four separate credit facilities. These are reflected in the table below:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Committed Credit Facilities </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Authorized\nAmountd </td> <td> </td> <td>Available\n12/31/2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Expiration\nDate </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured Facilities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Syndicated Line among 12 banks led by CFC </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>691 </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>December 2024 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CFC Line of Credit(2)\n</td> <td>110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 2023 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>JPMorgan Chase Line of Credit </td> <td>363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>247 </td> <td> </td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>October 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured Facilities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CFC Term Loan(2)\n</td> <td>250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 2023 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Of the portion of this facility that was unavailable at December 31, 2020, $383 million was dedicated to support outstanding commercial paper and $136 million related to letters of credit issued to support variable rate demand bonds.\n(2)Any amounts drawn under the $110 million unsecured line of credit with CFC will reduce the amount that can be drawn under the $250 million secured term loan. Therefore, we reflect $140 million as the amount available under the term loan even though there are no amounts outstanding under that facility. Any amounts borrowed under the $250 million term loan would be secured under our first mortgage indenture, with a maturity no later than December 31, 2043.\n(3)Of the portion of this facility that was unavailable at December 31, 2020, $114 million related to letters of credit issued to support variable rate demand bonds and $2 million related to letters of credit issued to post collateral to third parties. We amended this credit facility in March 2020 to increase the authorized amount from $150 million to $363 million, which is committed through the maturity of this facility in October 2021.\nWe have the flexibility to use the $1.2 billion syndicated line of credit for several purposes, including borrowing for general corporate purposes, issuing letters of credit and backing up commercial paper.\nUnder our commercial paper program we are authorized to issue commercial paper in amounts that do not exceed the amount of any committed backup lines of credit, thereby providing 100% dedicated support for any commercial paper outstanding.\nUnder our unsecured committed lines of credit, we have the ability to issue letters of credit totaling $973 million in the aggregate, of which $721.6 million remained available at December 31, 2020. However, amounts related to issued letters of credit reduce the amount that would otherwise be available to draw for working capital needs. Also, due to the requirement to\nhave 100% dedicated backup for any commercial paper outstanding, any amounts drawn under our committed credit facilities for working capital or related to issued letters of credit will reduce the amount of commercial paper that we can issue. The majority of our outstanding letters of credit are for the purpose of providing credit enhancement on variable rate demand bonds.\nIn addition to providing liquidity for various other purposes, including the temporary purchase of pollution control bonds from time to time, we issue commercial paper to provide interim financing of costs related to the construction of Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 which we repay with the proceeds from long-term funding sources. Our loan guaranteed by the Department of Energy is our preferred source of long-term financing for eligible costs for Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4. See \"- Financing Activities\" and Note 7a in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Department of Energy-guaranteed loan. In August 2020, we used the proceeds from a $450 million issuance of first mortgage bonds to pay down commercial paper that was used for Vogtle construction.\nIn 2020, we borrowed $45.9 million under various Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed loans for general and environmental improvements.\nBetween projected cash on hand and the credit arrangements currently in place, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to cover normal operations and our interim financing needs, including interim financing for the new Vogtle units, until long-term financing is obtained.\nThree of our line of credit facilities contain similar financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum patronage capital levels. Currently, we are required to maintain minimum patronage capital of $750 million. As of December 31, 2020, our patronage capital balance was $1.1 billion. These agreements contain an additional covenant that limits our secured indebtedness and our unsecured indebtedness, both as defined in the credit agreements, to $14 billion and $4 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2020, we had $10.6 billion of secured indebtedness outstanding and $383.5 million of unsecured indebtedness outstanding.\nUnder our power bill prepayment program, members can prepay their power bills from us at a discount for an agreed number of months in advance, after which point the funds are credited against the participating members' monthly power bills. At December 31, 2020, we had nine members participating in the program and a balance of $144.2 million remaining to be applied against future power bills.\nIn addition to unrestricted available liquidity, at December 31, 2020 we had $487.6 million of restricted liquidity in connection with deposits made into a Rural Utilities Service Cushion of Credit Account. The Farm Bill passed by Congress in December 2018 modified the Cushion of Credit program. The program no longer accepts deposits and the interest rate earned on existing deposits will change over time. Existing deposits will continue to earn 4% until October 1, 2021, at which point deposits will earn the 1-year floating Treasury rate. Funds in the account, including interest thereon, can only be applied to debt service on Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed Federal Financing Bank notes. We will determine when to apply the remaining funds in the Cushion of Credit account.\nLiquidity Covenants. At December 31, 2020, we had only one financial agreement in place containing a liquidity covenant. This covenant is in connection with the Rocky Mountain lease transaction and requires us to maintain minimum liquidity of $50 million at all times during the term of the lease. We had sufficient liquidity to meet this covenant in 2020 and expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet this covenant in 2021. For a discussion of the Rocky Mountain lease transaction, see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancing Activities\nFirst Mortgage Indenture. At December 31, 2020, we had $10.6 billion of outstanding debt secured equally and ratably under our first mortgage indenture, an increase of $893.4 million from December 31, 2019. From time to time, we may issue additional first mortgage obligations ranking equally and ratably with the existing first mortgage indenture obligations. The aggregate principal amount of obligations that may be issued under the first mortgage indenture is not limited; however, our ability to issue additional obligations under the first mortgage indenture is subject to certain requirements related to the certified value of certain of our tangible property, repayment of obligations outstanding under the first mortgage indenture and payments made under certain pledged contracts relating to property to be acquired. As of December 31, 2020, the amount of certified bondable additions and retired or defeased first mortgage indenture obligations available for the issuance of additional first mortgage indenture obligations was approximately $2.0 billion. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had\nover $662 million of property additions and certified progress payments under qualified engineering, procurement and construction contracts that, once certified in accordance with the first mortgage indenture, will be available for the issuance of additional first mortgage indenture obligations.\nDepartment of Energy-Guaranteed Loans. We have loans from the Federal Financing Bank guaranteed by the Department of Energy to provide funding for over $4.6 billion of the cost to construct our 30% undivided share of Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4. At December 31, 2020, aggregate Department of Energy-guaranteed borrowings totaled $3.6 billion, including capitalized interest. All of the debt advanced under the loan guarantee agreement is secured ratably with all other debt under our first mortgage indenture. For additional information regarding these loans, see Note 7a of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCombined, this $4.6 billion and the $2.3 billion of debt we have raised in the capital markets represent long-term financing for more than 92% of our $7.5 billion project budget. We expect to raise long-term financing for the remaining amounts in the capital markets.\nIn accordance with the related promissory notes, we began principal repayments of our Department of Energy-guaranteed loans in February 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had repaid $79.1 million under these loans. If we fully advance these loans, we expect to repay a total of approximately $300 million in principal on these loans by November 2022. We plan to issue first mortgage bonds to refinance the principal repaid before the in-service date of Vogtle Unit No. 4.\nRural Utilities Service-Guaranteed Loans. In July 2020, we advanced the remaining $5.8 million under a $448.3 million Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed loan that was funded through the Federal Financing Bank. We currently have one approved Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed loan totaling $630.3 million to fund general and environmental improvements. We began borrowing from this loan in January 2021. As of December 31, 2020, we had $2.4 billion of debt outstanding under various Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed loans, a decrease of $96.1 million from December 31, 2019.\nAll of the approved Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed loans are funded through the Federal Financing Bank, and the debt is secured ratably with all other debt under our first mortgage indenture.\nBond Financings. As a result of the market conditions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, on April 1, 2020, we purchased for our own account $212.8 million of Series 2013 term-rate pollution control revenue bonds that were issued on our behalf by the Development Authorities of Appling, Burke and Monroe counties which were subject to mandatory tender. We increased our JPMorgan Chase line of credit by $213 million and drew this amount to fund the purchase. We subsequently repaid this line of credit borrowing with commercial paper, and in August 2020, we remarketed these bonds and used the proceeds to repay the outstanding commercial paper that had financed the purchase of these bonds. In August 2020, we also issued $450 million of taxable first mortgage bonds to repay commercial paper issued to fund a portion of the cost of constructing Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4.\nCapital Requirements\nCash Requirements. Our cash requirements relate primarily to operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service. As discussed under \"Sources of Capital and Liquidity,\" we fund our cash requirements through a mix of funds generated from operations and short- and long-term borrowings. For additional information regarding our contractual commitments, see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital Expenditures. As part of our ongoing capital planning, we forecast expenditures required for generating facilities and other capital projects. The table below details these forecasts for 2021 through 2023. Actual expenditures may vary from the estimates listed in the table because of factors such as changes in business conditions, design changes and\nrework required by regulatory bodies, delays in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, construction delays, changing environmental requirements, and changes in cost of capital, equipment, material and labor.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Expenditures(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future Generation(2)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>973 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,388 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Existing Generation(3)\n</td> <td>132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>384 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental Compliance(4)\n</td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nuclear Fuel(5)\n</td> <td>93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>286 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General Plant </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,112 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes allowance for funds used during construction.\n(2)Relates to construction of Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4, excluding initial nuclear fuel core.

Since alternative legislative and regulatory environmental compliance programs continue to be debated on a state and national level, we cannot predict what capital costs may ultimately be required. Therefore, environmental expenditures included in the above table only include amounts related to budgeted projects to comply with existing and certain well-defined rules and regulations and do not include amounts related to compliance with other, less certain rules.\nDepending on how we and the other co-owners of Plants Scherer and Wansley choose to comply with any future legislation or regulations, both capital expenditures and operating expenditures may be impacted. As required by the wholesale power contracts, we expect to be able to recover from our members all capital and operating expenditures made in complying with current and future environmental regulations.\nFor additional information regarding environmental regulation, see \"BUSINESS - REGULATION - Environmental.\"\nCredit Rating Risk\nThe table below sets forth our current ratings from S&P Global Ratings, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Our Ratings </td> <td>S&P </td> <td> </td> <td>Moody's </td> <td> </td> <td>Fitch </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term ratings: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured rating </td> <td>BBB+ </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa1 </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB+ </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuer/unsecured rating(1)\n</td> <td>BBB+ </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa2 </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB+ </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating outlook </td> <td>Negative </td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> <td>Negative </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term rating: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper rating </td> <td>A-2 </td> <td> </td> <td>P-2 </td> <td> </td> <td>F1 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)We currently have no long-term debt that is unsecured, however, pricing of our $1.2 billion syndicated line of credit is determined based on our unsecured or issuer ratings.\nWe have financial and other contractual agreements in place containing provisions which, upon a credit rating downgrade below specified levels, may require the posting of collateral in the form of letters of credit or other acceptable\ncollateral. Our primary exposure to potential collateral postings is at rating levels of BBB-/Baa3 or below. As of December 31, 2020, our maximum potential collateral requirements were as follows:\nAt senior secured rating levels:\n\u2022approximately $52 million at a senior secured level of BBB-/Baa3,\n\u2022approximately $93 million at a senior secured level of BB+/Ba1 or below, and\nAt senior unsecured or issuer rating levels:\n\u2022approximately $5.4 million at a senior unsecured or issuer level of BBB-/Baa3,\n\u2022approximately $62 million at a senior unsecured or issuer rating level of BB+/Ba1 or below.\nThe Rural Utilities Service Loan Contract contains covenants that, upon a credit rating downgrade below investment grade by two rating agencies, could result in restrictions on issuing debt. Certain of credit agreements and pollution control bond agreements contain provisions based on our ratings that, upon a credit rating downgrade below specified levels, could result in increased interest rates. Also, borrowing rates, letter of credit fees and commitment fees in two of our lines of credit agreements are based on credit ratings and could increase if our ratings are lowered. None of these covenants and provisions, however, would result in acceleration of any debt due to credit rating downgrades.\nGiven our current level of ratings, our management does not have any reason to expect a downgrade that would result in any material impacts to our business. However, our ratings reflect only the views of the rating agencies and we cannot give any assurance that our ratings will be maintained at current levels for any period of time.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Overview\nGeneral\nOur principal business is reliably providing wholesale electric service to our 38 members in a safe and cost-effective manner. Consequently, substantially all of our revenues and cash flow are derived from sales to our members pursuant to take-or-pay wholesale power contracts that extend through 2050. These contracts obligate our members jointly and severally to pay all of our costs and expenses associated with owning and operating our power supply business. To that end, our rate structure provides for a pass-through of actual energy costs. Charges for fixed costs, including capacity, other non-energy charges, debt service obligations and the margin required to meet our budgeted margins for interest ratio are carefully managed throughout the year to ensure that we collect sufficient capacity-related revenues. Our rate structure provides us with the ability to manage our revenues to assure full recovery of our costs and has enabled us consistently to meet our financial obligations since our formation in 1974.\n2020 Financial Results\nDespite the challenges and uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we had another successful year in 2020 and continue to be well positioned, both financially and operationally, to fulfill our obligations to our members, bondholders and creditors. Our revenues were more than sufficient to recover all of our costs and to satisfy all of our debt service obligations and financial covenants. Specifically, we recorded a net margin of $55.9 million in 2020, which achieved the 1.14 margins for interest ratio approved by our board of directors and exceeded the 1.10 margins for interest ratio required to meet the rate covenant under our first mortgage indenture. For 2021, we are again targeting a margins for interest ratio of 1.14, effectively increasing our annual margins by 40% over the minimum required level. We anticipate that we will continue to target a 1.14 margins for interest ratio through the remainder of the Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 construction period.\nAs a result of expanding our generation capacity and upgrading our generation facilities over the past decade, our total assets and total debt have significantly increased. At December 31, 2020, our total assets were $14.2 billion and total long-term debt was $10.6 billion. During the remainder of the Vogtle construction period, we expect that our assets and long-term debt will continue to increase. However, strategic financing and refinancing of capital investments with long-term debt through the Department of Energy and Rural Utilities Service loan guarantee programs, taxable and tax-exempt capital markets offerings and a continued low interest rate environment enabled us to borrow long-term debt at our lowest interest rates to date during 2020 and further decreased our weighted average interest cost on long-term debt from 5.41% per year at December 31, 2009 to 3.73% per year at December 31, 2020. We will continue to actively manage our debt portfolio and utilize advantageous borrowing programs available to us as our ability to borrow at lower costs ultimately benefits our members and their customers as interest savings are reflected in our pass-through rate structure.\nVogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4\nThe construction of Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 continues to be a primary focus area. Our current budget for our 30% ownership interest in these units is $7.5 billion, which includes capital costs, allowance for funds used during construction, our allocation of the project-level contingency and a separate Oglethorpe-level contingency. As of December 31, 2020, our total investment in the additional Vogtle units was $6.0 billion. The Georgia Public Service Commission approved in-service dates for Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 are November 2021 and November 2022, respectively.\nConstruction continues to make significant progress at the site and a number of important construction, system turnover and testing milestones were achieved during 2020. Southern Nuclear and Georgia Power continue to manage the construction at the site and maintained operations throughout 2020 while implementing comprehensive mitigation measures to manage the impact of COVID-19 at the site. Although construction activities continued, workforce disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing productivity challenges which have continued into 2021. As a result of these challenges, Southern Nuclear has further extended certain milestone dates, including the start of hot functional testing and fuel load for Unit No. 3. The Unit No. 3 schedule is challenged, and while the ability to achieve the November 2021 regulatory in-service date remains a target for Southern Nuclear, we believe a delay is likely which could add a month or more to the Unit No. 3\nin-service date. As Unit No. 3 approaches hot functional testing, key factors impacting the schedule include both the pace of work package completion and system turnovers, and required construction remediation work.\nAchievement of the November 2022 regulatory in-service date for Unit No. 4 primarily depends on overall construction productivity and production levels significantly improving as well as appropriate levels of craft laborers, particularly electrical and pipefitter craft labor, being added and maintained. In the event that there is any schedule extension beyond the November 2021 and November 2022 regulatory in-service dates for Units No. 3 and No. 4, respectively, the Oglethorpe-level contingency level in our current $7.5 billion budget is expected to be sufficient to withstand up to a 4-month delay for Unit No. 3 and a 3-month delay for Unit No. 4. Any further delays beyond these extended dates are expected to impact our cost by approximately $55 million per month for both units and approximately $25 million per month for Unit No. 4 only, including financing costs.\nUpon completion, Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 will have an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 2,200 megawatts and our 30% undivided interest will entitle us to approximately 660 megawatts of carbon-free, baseload generating capacity. We expect these units to be valuable assets for us and our members over the next 60 to 80 years and to contribute to our diverse pool of generation resources. For additional information regarding Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 and related financing activities, see BUSINESS - OUR POWER SUPPLY RESOURCES - Future Power Resources - Plant Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4,\u201d - Financial Condition - Financing Activities - Department of Energy-Guaranteed Loans\u201d and - Capital Requirements - Capital Expenditures\u201d and Note 7a of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCOVID-19\nWe were able to successfully navigate the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 and are proud of our associates' response to the outbreak. As an electric utility, we are deemed part of the nation's critical infrastructure and continued operating during the pandemic to provide electricity to our members and the populations they serve. To protect our associates and the public and to maintain operating capabilities, we implemented applicable business continuity plans, including working remotely where possible; increased cleaning frequency at business locations; implemented applicable safety and health guidelines issued by federal and state officials; and established protocols to maintain generation reliability. In June, we began a phased reopening of our corporate offices with new safety protocols intended to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19. To date, these measures have been effective in maintaining our critical operations and we continue to keep in contact with state and federal regulators to ensure the safety of our associates and reliability of our generation facilities.\nWhile there were temporary disruptions in the capital and equity markets over the course of the year, the COVID pandemic did not have a significant effect on our business operations or financial condition. For 2020, our analysis indicates that the impact of COVID-19 on our members' sales was approximately one percent. The potential decrease in sales was mitigated by the fact that approximately two-thirds of our members' sales are to residential customers. Further, although our members were subject to an increased risk that their consumers may not be able to pay utility bills on time or may seek to enter into alternative payment plans, our members have continued to pay all amounts due under the wholesale power contracts on a timely basis and we are not aware of a significant increase of bad debt with any of our members. While we are encouraged by the increasing distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines, the ultimate impact of the pandemic on us and our members remains subject to many factors, including the timing of achieving a sufficient level of vaccinations and the remaining duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions.\nLiquidity Position\nOur strong liquidity position continues to be one of the most positive attributes contributing to our solid financial standing. This liquidity is comprised of a diversified, cost-effective mix of cash (including short-term investments), committed lines of credit and commercial paper. Our primary source of liquidity is a $1.2 billion unsecured credit facility that extends through December 2024 and supports our commercial paper program. Additionally, we have three other bank credit facilities which provide another $613 million in credit commitments, including a $363 million line of credit from J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, which we increased from $150 million in March 2020.\nIn addition to our strong liquidity, we have multiple sources of long-term financing available to meet our anticipated capital needs. These sources include Department of Energy and Rural Utilities Service federal loan programs and the taxable\nand tax-exempt capital markets. We expect to continue utilizing each of these sources of capital to meet our long-term financing needs in the coming years.\nWith our current sources of committed short-term and long-term funding, we anticipate that we will have sufficient liquidity to complete Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nAnother of our key focus areas is maintaining compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulatory standards. We own electric generation facilities powered by nuclear, natural gas, coal and hydro resources which presents substantial challenges for us and our members to comply with existing environmental regulations. Based on the new presidential administration's executive orders, statements regarding reducing carbon dioxide emissions and decision to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, we expect existing environmental regulations to become more stringent. As an electric cooperative that operates on a not-for-profit basis, our compliance costs are ultimately borne by our members' electricity consumers.\nGreenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, are again the focus of increased federal environmental regulations. Effective February 19, 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement and will develop proposed reductions in carbon dioxide which could lead to legislative and regulatory actions to support those goals. The EPA is expected to undertake a new rulemaking process to address carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants following the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's decision to vacate and remand the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule. At this time we cannot predict the outcome or potential cost of any legislative or regulatory changes on us or our members but it could be significant. We also believe that we are well-situated to effectively manage such challenges and that our diverse asset base, along with our investment in additional carbon-free generation at Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4, positions us well to continue to meet our members' needs. Further, our members continue to pursue renewable generation opportunities and invest where they deem appropriate in order to further diversify their power supply resources to meet the demands of their member consumers and prepare for potential future limitations on greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn addition to greenhouse gases, we must also comply with several other environmental regulations. For example, in order to comply with federal and state coal combustion residual rules and effluent limitation guidelines, we are investing approximately $289 million in capital costs, of which $242 million has already been spent, in addition to $400 million to $550 million (in year of expenditure dollars) associated with our corresponding asset retirement obligations. If existing laws or regulations related to the disposal of CCR and treatment of coal ash ponds were to change or we are otherwise required to revise our existing closure plans, our related obligations could increase materially.\nAsset Management\nAnother of our primary focus areas continues to be ensuring that our owned and operated generation facilities perform in the most efficient and cost-effective manner possible and, in 2021, we will continue to seek ways to improve the reliability of our generating facilities. Our Operational Excellence program strives to achieve safety, reliability and compliance in a cost effective manner. Many of the generation facilities we operate rank in the top quartile of similar plants in one or more key performance indicators, including start reliability, peak season availability and forced outages. Additionally, our generation assets are built and designed to operate in extreme winter weather. Following the 2014 polar vortex, we implemented design improvements across our fleet of power plants to safeguard against subzero temperatures and ensure reliable generation resources for our members. Achieving operational excellence results in the most reliable, efficient and lowest cost power supply for our members; therefore, effective asset management will always be one of our top priorities.\nAs we assess the operation of our existing generation resources, a continued trend in the dispatch of our generation assets is the significant decrease in coal-fired generation. The percentage of energy from coal generation that we supply to our members has decreased from 45% in 2008 to 5% in 2020. The two primary drivers of this shift in generation were our acquisition of additional natural gas-fired resources and a significant fall in natural gas prices. As a result of this trend and capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations, Georgia Power is evaluating whether to retire Plant Wansley Units No. 1 and No. 2 as early as fall 2022. As we look ahead, we continue to consider the role that coal-fired generation resources play in our overall portfolio and the ability to provide reliable and cost-effective generation for our members.\nIn addition to our current assets, we continue to evaluate potential resources to meet our members' needs at the lowest reasonable cost. On March 1, 2021, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire Effingham County Power, a 511-megawatt natural gas-fired combined cycle peaking facility that is subject to customary closing terms and conditions. If completed, this acquisition would provide an additional efficient and economically priced generation resource to our members.\nRate Management Programs\nOver the last five years, our average wholesale power rate to our members has been at or below the mid-six cents per kilowatt-hour range. Given the magnitude of the Vogtle project, we and some of our members have voluntarily implemented various rate management programs to smooth out the impact on rates when Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 reach commercial operation.\nBeginning in 2018, we offered our members an optional rate management program allowing for an election of additional collections of future expenses for a five-year period which will then be applied to billings over the subsequent five-year period. For participating members, the additional collections will have the effect of gradually increasing their payments to us over the initial five year period, 2018 to 2022, in order to soften the impact of full integration of the new Vogtle units' costs into rates. In 2023 to 2025, the first few full years after expected commercial operation of the Vogtle units, we will apply a portion of the additional amounts collected to participating members' bills, which we expect to reduce the rate impact to those members by approximately one-half of a cent each year, from the mid-seven cents per kilowatt-hour range to around seven cents per kilowatt-hour. The impact of the program will gradually decrease through 2027, its final year. Further, because we only supply around 60% of our members' wholesale power requirements, the ultimate rate impact on the retail consumers may be further mitigated as our members' rates are blended with their supplemental power supply sources, transmission and retail distribution costs.\nOutlook for 2021\nAs the electric utility industry across the country continues to experience change, we remain focused on providing reliable, safe, and cost-effective energy to our members and the 4.3 million people they serve and believe we are well positioned to do so. As discussed above, there are certain risks and challenges that we must continue to address, most notably related to Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 and anticipated environmental regulation. However, as we manage our risks, we intend to keep doing what we have done so successfully for the last 47 years, including, among other things:\n\u2022maintaining a balanced and diverse portfolio of generating resources, including nuclear, natural gas, coal and hydro and continuing the efficient and cost-effective operation of these resources;\n\u2022maintaining strong liquidity to fulfill current obligations and to finance future capital expenditures; and\n\u2022working with our members to explore existing and emerging opportunities to add value to our ultimate consumers.\nAccounting Policies\nBasis of Accounting\nWe follow generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and the practices prescribed in the Uniform System of Accounts of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as modified and adopted by the Rural Utilities Service.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe have determined that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations and requires our management to make estimates and assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time of the preparation of our financial statements. Changes in these estimates and assumptions by our management could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition. Our management has discussed these critical accounting policies and the related estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of our board of directors.\nRegulatory Accounting. We are subject to the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) authoritative guidance issued regarding regulated operations. The guidance permits us to record regulatory assets and\nregulatory liabilities to reflect future cost recoveries or refunds, respectively, that we have a right to pass through to our members. At December 31, 2020, our regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities totaled $731.4 million and $566.4 million, respectively. While we do not currently foresee any events such as competition or other factors that would make it not probable that we will recover these costs from our members as future revenues through rates under our wholesale power contracts, if such an event were to occur, we could no longer apply the provisions of accounting for regulated operations, which would require us to eliminate all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities that had been recognized as a charge or credit to our statement of revenues and expenses and begin recognizing assets and liabilities in a manner similar to other businesses in general. In addition, we would be required to determine any impairment to other assets, including plants, and write-down those assets, if impaired, to their fair values.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. Accounting for asset retirement and environmental obligations requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at fair value when incurred and capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset. In the absence of quoted market prices, we estimate the fair value of our asset retirement obligations using present value techniques, in which estimates of future cash flows associated with retirement activities are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures includes, among other things, making projections of when assets will be retired and ultimately decommissioned, the amount of decommissioning costs, and how costs will escalate with inflation.\nA significant portion of our asset retirement obligations relates to our share of the future cost to decommission our operating nuclear units and the coal ash ponds at our coal-fired units. At December 31, 2020, our nuclear decommissioning and coal ash related asset retirement obligations were $738.2 million and $346.6 million, respectively. Our asset retirement obligations represent an estimate of the present value of anticipated retirement costs. For additional detail regarding our asset retirement obligations, see Note 1h of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These obligations represented 95% of our total asset retirement obligations.\nGiven its significance, we consider our nuclear decommissioning liabilities critical estimates. Approximately every three years, new decommissioning studies for Plants Hatch and Vogtle are performed. These studies provide us with periodic site-specific \"base year\" cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost and timing of planned decommissioning activities for the plants. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows for extended periods are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual costs. In addition, these estimates are dependent on subjective factors, including the selection of cost escalation and discount rates, which we consider to be critical assumptions. Our current estimates are based upon studies that were performed in 2018. For ratemaking purposes, we record decommissioning costs over the expected service life of each unit. The impact on measurements of asset retirement obligations using different assumptions in the future may be significant.\nWe also consider our coal ash related decommissioning liabilities at Plants Scherer and Wansley to be critical estimates, in particular those for the coal ash ponds. Cost studies are periodically performed to provide site-specific \"base year\" estimates that determine the nature and timing of planned decommissioning costs. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows for extended periods are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual costs. Critical assumptions include coal ash pond closure strategy, including water treatment requirements, and the volume of coal ash in the ponds. In addition, these estimates are dependent on other subjective factors, such as estimates of costs to perform the decommissioning and post-closure activities, timing of expenditures, and the selection of cost escalation and discount rates. Our current estimates are based upon studies that were performed in 2019. For ratemaking purposes, we are applying regulated operations accounting to the decommissioning costs and currently expect to recover ash pond closure costs over approximately 12 years. The impact on measurements of asset retirement obligations using different assumptions in the future may be significant.\nRecently issued or adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\u201d. The amendments in this update apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The amendments in this update provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments in this update do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for hedging\nrelationships existing as of December 31, 2022, for which an entity has elected certain optional expedients that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship.\nIn January 2021, the FASB issued Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope,\u201d to further clarify the scope of the reference rate reform guidance in Topic 848. The amendments in this update refine the scope of Topic 848 to clarify that certain optional expedients and exceptions therein for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to contracts that are affected by the discounting transition. Specifically, modifications related to reference rate reform would not be considered an event that requires reassessment of previous accounting conclusions. The amendments in this update also amend the expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 to capture the incremental consequences of the scope clarification and to tailor the existing guidance to derivative instruments affected by the discounting transition.\nThe amendments in these updates are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating the future impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued \"Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\" The standard was effective for us prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods therein. On January 1, 2020, we adopted this standard. The standard requires consideration of a broad range of information to estimate expected credit losses over the lifetime of financial assets measured at amortized cost. The new credit losses standard replaced the incurred loss\u201d methodology for recognizing credit losses that delayed recognition until it was probable a loss had been incurred. The financial assets we hold that are subject to the new standard are predominately accounts receivable and certain cash equivalents classified as held-to-maturity debt (e.g. commercial paper). Our receivables are generally due within thirty days or less with a significant portion related to billings to our members. See Notes 1e and 1f for information regarding our member receivables. Commercial paper issuances we invest in are rated as investment grade and backed by a credit facility. Given our historical experience, the short duration lifetime of these financial assets and the short time horizon over which to consider expectations of future economic conditions, we have assessed that non-collection of the cost basis of these financial assets is remote. The adoption of the standard did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued \"Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.\" This standard eliminated, added and modified certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements as part of the FASB's disclosure framework project. Entities are no longer required to disclose the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the policy for timing of transfers between levels and the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. However, public business entities are required to disclose the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. The amendments in this update were effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. An entity was permitted to early adopt any removed or modified disclosures upon issuance of this update and delay adoption of the additional disclosures until their effective date. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\u201d, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in the accounting standards. The amendments in the standard remove certain exceptions and also clarify and simplify various aspects of accounting for income taxes. The new standard is effective for us prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted, which we are not electing to do. The adoption of the standard on January 1, 2021 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nSummary of Cooperative Operations\nSources of Revenues\nWe operate on a not-for-profit basis and, accordingly, seek only to generate revenues sufficient to recover our cost of service and to generate margins sufficient to establish reasonable reserves and meet certain financial coverage requirements. Our primary source of revenue is the sale of capacity and energy to our members for a portion of their energy requirements. We may also sell capacity and energy to non-members. Capacity revenues are the revenues we receive for providing electric service whether or not our generation and purchased power resources are dispatched to produce electricity. Energy revenues are the revenues we receive by selling electricity that we generate or purchase.\nWe have assigned fixed percentage capacity cost responsibilities to our members for all of our generation and purchased power resources. Each member has contractually agreed to pay us for the electric capacity assigned to it based on its individual fixed percentage capacity cost responsibility.\nEach member is also contractually obligated to pay us for electric energy we provide to it based on individual usage. Energy sales to our members fluctuate from period to period based on several factors, including fuel costs, weather and other seasonal factors, load requirements in the service territories of our members, operating costs, availability of electric generation resources and our decisions of whether to dispatch our owned or purchased resources or member-owned resources over which we have dispatch rights. In addition, as we do not provide our members with all of their energy requirements, energy sales may also fluctuate based on our members' decisions of whether to purchase a portion of their hourly energy requirements from our resources or from other suppliers.\nFormulary Rate\nThe rates we charge our members are designed to cover all of our costs plus a margin. This cost-plus rate structure is set forth as a formula in the rate schedule to the wholesale power contracts between us and each of our members. These contracts require us to design capacity and energy rates that generate revenues sufficient to recover all costs, including payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, to establish and maintain reasonable margins and to meet the financial coverage requirements under the first mortgage indenture.\nThe formulary rate provides for the pass through of our fixed costs to members as capacity charges and our variable costs to members as energy charges. Fixed costs are assigned to members according to their individual fixed percentage capacity cost responsibility for each resource in which they participate. Variable costs are passed through to our members based on the amount of energy supplied to each member.\nCapacity charges are based on an annual budget of fixed costs plus a targeted margin and are billed to members in equal monthly installments over the course of the year. Fixed costs include items such as depreciation, interest, fixed operations and maintenance expenses, administrative and general expenses. We monitor fixed cost budget variances to projected actual costs throughout the year, and with board approval, make budget adjustments when and as necessary to ensure that we generate revenues sufficient to recover all costs and to meet our targeted margin. Budget adjustments are typically made twice a year; once during the first quarter and again at year end. In contrast to the way we bill our members for capacity charges, which are billed based on a budget and trued up to actuals by the end of the year, energy charges are billed on a more real-time basis. Estimated energy charges are billed to members based on the amount of energy supplied to each member during the month, and are adjusted when actual costs are available, generally the following month. Energy charges, or variable costs, include fuel, purchased energy and variable operations and maintenance expenses. Each generating resource has a different variable cost profile, and members are billed based on the energy cost profile of the resources from which their energy is supplied.\nMargins\nRevenues in excess of current period costs in any year are designated as net margin in our statements of revenues and expenses and we have generated a positive net margin every year since our formation in 1974. Under our first mortgage indenture, we are required, subject to any necessary regulatory approval, to establish and collect rates that are reasonably expected, together with our other revenues, to yield a margins for interest ratio for each fiscal year equal to at least 1.10. See \"BUSINESS - OGLETHORPE POWER CORPORATION - First Mortgage Indenture\" for a discussion of how we calculate our margins for interest ratio.\nIn the event we were to fall short of the minimum 1.10 margins for interest ratio at year end, the formulary rate is designed to recover the shortfall from our members in the following year without any additional action by our board of directors.\nPrior to 2009, we budgeted and achieved annual margins for interest ratios of 1.10, the minimum required by the first mortgage indenture. To enhance margin coverage during a period of increased capital requirements, our board of directors has approved budgets with margins for interest ratios that exceeded 1.10. Since 2010, we have achieved our board approved margins for interest ratio of 1.14, and our board has approved a margins for interest ratio of 1.14 for 2021. As our capital requirements continue to evolve, our board will continue to evaluate the level of margin coverage and may choose to change the targeted margins for interest ratio in the future, although not below 1.10.\nPatronage Capital\nRetained net margins are designated on our balance sheets as patronage capital. As a cooperative, patronage capital constitutes our principal equity. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.1 billion in patronage capital and membership fees. Our equity ratio, calculated pursuant to our first mortgage indenture as patronage capital and membership fees divided by total capitalization and long-term debt due within one year, was 9.1% and 9.4% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nPatronage capital is allocated to each of our members on the basis of their fixed percentage capacity responsibilities in our generation resources. Any distribution of patronage capital is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and limitations under our first mortgage indenture. See \"BUSINESS - OGLETHORPE POWER CORPORATION - First Mortgage Indenture\" for a discussion regarding limitations on distributions under our first mortgage indenture.\nRate Regulation\nUnder our loan agreements with each of the Rural Utilities Service and Department of Energy, changes to our rates resulting from adjustments in our annual budget are generally not subject to their approval. We must provide the Rural Utilities Service and Department of Energy with a notice of and opportunity to object to most changes to the formulary rate under the wholesale power contracts. See \"BUSINESS - OGLETHORPE POWER CORPORATION - Relationship with Federal Lenders.\" Currently, our rates are not subject to the approval of any other federal or state agency or authority, including the Georgia Public Service Commission.\nTax Status\nWhile we are a not-for-profit membership corporation formed under the laws of Georgia, we are subject to federal and state income taxation. As a taxable cooperative, we are allowed to deduct patronage dividends that we allocate to our members for purposes of calculating our taxable income. We annually allocate income and deductions between patronage and non-patronage activities and substantially all of our income is from patronage-sourced activities, resulting in no current period income tax expense or current income tax liability. For further discussion of our taxable status, see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nFactors Affecting Results\nCertain of our recent financial and operational results were affected both by the way in which we dispatch our power plants as well as by significant events or trends described below.\nWe have a diverse mix of generation and fuel types among our power plants, allowing us to serve the power needs of our members in a reliable, efficient and low-cost manner. The types of generation assets we own include several natural gas-fired simple cycle combustion turbine plants, two combined cycle natural gas-fired plants, a plant that burns bituminous coal, a plant that burns sub-bituminous coal, two nuclear plants and a pumped storage hydroelectric plant.\nDecisions to dispatch our power plants and thus the amount of energy we generate and sell to our members are economically driven by supply and demand considerations. The primary supply considerations include (i) fuel prices and other marginal operating costs of the plant, which factor into a dispatch cost we calculate for each resource, (ii) plant availability, which is driven by factors such as outages for maintenance or refuelings and (iii) plant efficiency, as determined by the heat rate which measures the amount of fuel required to generate one kilowatt hour of electricity. We prioritize the order in which we dispatch our plants such that we dispatch our available plants with the lowest dispatch cost first, and those with the highest dispatch cost last, when demand is highest. The primary demand consideration that affects how we dispatch our plants is the amount of energy our members require from us. This is a function of weather, economic activity, residential use patterns and the relative cost and availability of our members' third party supply arrangements, which account for a significant portion of the energy they purchase. In 2020, our energy generation and member sales were down by approximately 5% when compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to milder weather in the winter and summer, with only about 1% related to reduced demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSince we pass through all of our costs to members, including fuel cost, which is one of our most significant operating costs, the cost of our energy sales to our members is significantly affected by fuel prices. The price of natural gas is the most\nsignificant variable in our cost of fuel and also affects how we dispatch our generation resources. Natural gas prices were relatively low in 2018 and 2019, and continued to trend downward in 2020. In addition to the prevailing market price, our average cost of natural gas per kilowatt hour generated is also affected by how efficiently our natural gas facilities burn the gas. Compared to our combined cycle units, our combustion turbine units are less efficient and thus burn more gas per kilowatt hour of electricity generated. Consequently, our combustion turbine units have a higher dispatch cost than our combined cycle units and are typically used to generate energy only during periods of higher electricity demand, such as on hot summer days. In 2020, generation from our combustion turbine units was less than in 2019 due to the aforementioned mild weather.\nAs a result of the low natural gas price environment, our coal units have become less economical and are generating less energy to sell to our members. In 2020, generation from our coal units was 5% of our gross total energy generation compared to 10% in 2019 and 16% in 2018.\nOur nuclear units require refueling on an 18 to 24-month cycle and these refueling outages, which typically last several weeks, resulted in fluctuations in nuclear plant availability and generation in each of the last three years. These shutdowns and outages significantly reduced generation at the affected plants, reduced kilowatt-hour sales to and energy revenues from our members during the periods that the plants were not generating power.\nOur energy sales to our members also fluctuate from period to period based on weather. For 2020, the winter was very mild and summer was moderately milder when compared to the prior ten year average. The mild weather largely contributed to the decrease in energy sales in 2020 compared to 2019. However, in July our members experienced a peak just short of the all-time peak demand that occurred in August 2019. This was a result of warmer than normal weather in July combined with many of our members' residential customers working remotely from home and commercial loads returning to pre-COVID-19 levels.\nWe also continued to make significant capital expenditures over the past three years, particularly for the new units under construction at Plant Vogtle, which we have primarily financed with debt. These financings have increased our overall debt which has increased our interest expense and our allowance for debt funds used during construction. Additionally, since our margin is calculated as a percentage of our secured interest expense, our net margin has generally increased. As discussed under \"- Financial Condition - Capital Resources - Capital Expenditures,\" we expect significant capital expenditures to continue through the completion of the additional units at Plant Vogtle.\nNet Margin\nOur net margin for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $55.9 million, $54.5 million and $51.2 million, respectively. These amounts produced a margins for interest ratio of 1.14 in each of 2020, 2019 and 2018. For additional information on our margin requirement, see \"- Summary of Cooperative Operations - Rate Regulation.\"\nOperating Revenues\nSales to Members. We generate revenues principally from the sale of electric capacity and energy to our members. Capacity revenues are the revenues we receive for electric service whether or not our generation and purchased power resources are dispatched to produce electricity. These revenues are designed to recover the fixed costs associated with our business, including fixed production expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses and interest charges, plus a targeted margin. Energy revenues are the sales of electricity generated or purchased for our members. Energy revenues recover the variable costs of our business, including fuel, purchased energy and variable operation and maintenance expense.\nThe components of member revenues were as follows:\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> <td>2019 vs. 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td>2019 </td> <td>2018 </td> <td>% Change </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capacity revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>971,071 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>942,057 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>927,419 </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy revenues </td> <td>405,939 </td> <td> </td> <td>487,795 </td> <td> </td> <td>551,960 </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td>(11.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,377,010 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,429,852 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,479,379 </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.7) </td> <td>% </td> <td>(3.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>kWh Sales </td> <td>22,187,311 </td> <td> </td> <td>23,225,861 </td> <td> </td> <td>23,011,079 </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cents/kWh </td> <td>6.21 </td> <td> </td> <td>6.16 </td> <td> </td> <td>6.43 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td>(4.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Member energy requirements supplied </td> <td>57 </td> <td>% </td> <td>58 </td> <td>% </td> <td>57 </td> <td>% </td> <td>(1.7) </td> <td>% </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapacity revenues increased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the recovery of higher fixed production costs. The slight increase in capacity revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 was due primarily to the recovery of depreciation and accretion expenses. For a discussion of production costs and depreciation and accretion expense, see \"- Operating Expenses.\"\nThe 16.8% decrease in energy revenues from members in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily a result of a decrease in total fuel expense, including a decrease in generation for member sales. Energy revenues from members in 2019 compared to 2018 decreased 11.6% due to a decrease in total fuel expense, offset by a slight increase in generation for member sales. For a discussion of fuel expense, see \"- Operating Expenses.\"\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses decreased 4.4% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to a decline in fuel costs, and offset by an increase in production costs. In 2019 compared to 2018, operating expenses decreased 3.4% primarily due to a decline in fuel costs, offset by an increase in depreciation and accretion.\nThe following table summarizes our net kilowatt-hour (kWh) generation and fuel costs by generating source.\n Cost Generation Cents per kWh (dollars in thousands) (kWh in thousands) Fuel Source 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs. % Change 2019 vs. % Change 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs. % Change 2019 vs. % Change 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs. % Change 2019 vs. % Change Coal $ 40,222 $ 80,706 $ 119,459 (50.2) % (32.4) % 1,137,027 2,592,023 4,062,982 (56.1) % (36.2) % 3.54 3.11 2.94 13.6 % 5.9 % Nuclear 75,968 79,893 85,949 (4.9) % (7.0) % 9,832,564 10,061,609 10,314,928 (2.3) % (2.5) % 0.77 0.79 0.83 (2.7) % (4.8) % Natural Gas: Combined Cycle 202,030 225,816 240,122 (10.5) % (6.0) % 10,473,139 9,649,561 8,047,494 8.5 % 19.9 % 1.93 2.34 2.98 (17.6) % (21.5) % Combustion Turbine 42,034 53,799 57,374 (21.9) % (6.2) % 1,386,569 1,562,895 1,271,542 (11.3) % 22.9 % 3.03 3.44 4.51 (11.9) % (23.7) % $ 360,254 $ 440,214 $ 502,904 (18.2) % (12.5) % 22,829,299 23,866,088 23,696,946 (4.3) % 0.7 % 1.58 1.84 2.12 (14.4) % (13.2) % \nTotal fuel expense decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily as a result of lower natural gas prices, which also contributed to a shift in generation from coal-fired plants to more economical natural gas-fired plants. Included in total fuel expense were $20.3 million of losses in 2020 and $9.1 million of losses in 2019 incurred for the settlement of natural gas financial contracts we utilize to manage our exposure to fluctuations in market prices. Total generation increased slightly in 2019 compared to 2018.\nProduction costs can vary due to the number and extent of outages in a given year. Production costs increased 4.3% in 2020 compared to 2019 and decreased 1.7% in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in 2020 was due to planned major maintenance outages at Plant Smith during the year. The decrease in 2019 was due to a reduction in fixed and variable maintenance costs driven by outages during the prior year.\nOther Income\nTotal other income decreased 21.0% in 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of lower investment balances and lower interest rates. The 6.0% decrease in other income in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to losses realized on the retirement of certain leasehold improvements.\nInterest Charges\nAllowance for debt funds used during construction increased in 2020 and 2019 primarily due to increased borrowings or Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 construction expenditures.\nFinancial Condition\nOverview\nConsistent with our budgeted margin for 2020, we achieved a 1.14 margins for interest ratio which produced a net margin of $55.9 million. This net margin increased our total patronage capital (our equity) and membership fees to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2020. Our 2021 budget again targets a 1.14 margins for interest ratio.\nOur equity to total capitalization ratio, as defined in our first mortgage indenture, was 9.1% at December 31, 2020 and 9.4% at December 31, 2019. We anticipate that our equity ratio will remain around its current level during the remainder of the Vogtle construction period; however, the absolute level of patronage capital will continue to increase.\nWe had a strong liquidity position at December 31, 2020 with $1.6 billion of unrestricted available liquidity, including $405.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. We issued commercial paper throughout the year to provide interim financing for the Plant Vogtle construction and for other purposes at a low cost. The average cost of funds on the $383.5 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2020 was 0.3%.\nOur total assets increased to $14.2 billion at December 31, 2020 from $13.0 billion at December 31, 2019. For the past several years, our total assets have shown significant increases due to increases in construction work in progress in connection with the additional nuclear units under construction at Plant Vogtle.\nProperty additions during 2020 totaled $1.3 billion. These additions include costs related to the construction of the new Vogtle units, environmental control facilities being installed at coal-fired Plants Scherer and Wansley, normal additions and replacements to existing generation facilities and purchases of nuclear fuel.\nThere was a net increase in long-term debt and finance leases of $887.3 million at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. The weighted average interest rate on the $10.6 billion of long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 was 3.73%.\nSources of Capital and Liquidity\nSources of Capital. We fund our capital requirements through a combination of funds generated from operations and short-term and long-term borrowings. See \"- Capital Requirements - Capital Expenditures\" for more detailed information regarding our estimated capital expenditures.\nWe have $4.6 billion of loans from the Federal Financing Bank that are guaranteed by the Department of Energy. These loans provide funding for a portion of our cost to construct our 30% interest in the two new nuclear units at Plant Vogtle. As of December 31, 2020, we had $3.6 billion outstanding under these loans and may draw the remaining amounts through November 2023.\nHistorically, we have also obtained a substantial portion of our long-term financing from Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed loans funded by the Federal Financing Bank. However, Rural Utilities Service funding levels for projects we may choose to undertake are uncertain and may be limited in the future due to budgetary and political pressures faced by Congress. Because of these factors, we cannot predict the amount or cost of Rural Utilities Service loans that may be available to us in the future.\nWe have also issued a substantial amount of taxable and tax-exempt debt in the capital markets. If the Rural Utilities Service loan program were to be curtailed or eliminated or if we are unable to draw the full amount of the Department of Energy-guaranteed loan, we believe we are well positioned to continue to access capital market financings. See \"- Financing Activities\" for more detailed information regarding our financing plans.\nSee Note 7 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these loans.\nSee \"BUSINESS - OGLETHORPE POWER CORPORATION - Relationship with Federal Lenders\" for further discussion of our relationship with the Department of Energy and Rural Utilities Service.\nLiquidity. At December 31, 2020, we had $1.6 billion of unrestricted available liquidity to meet short-term cash needs and liquidity requirements, consisting of $405.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.2 billion of unused and available committed credit arrangements.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $511.4 million in 2020, and averaged $450.8 million per year for the three-year period 2018 through 2020.\nWe monitor our anticipated liquidity needs to ensure that our credit facility portfolio appropriately covers our anticipated needs. In March 2020, we amended our $150 million line of credit with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank to increase the commitment to $363 million, and used this line of credit, and subsequently commercial paper, to temporarily finance the purchase of $212.8 million of pollution control bonds that were subject to mandatory tender on April 1, 2020. In August 2020 we remarketed the pollution control bonds and used the proceeds to repay these borrowings. See \"- Financing Activities - Bond Financings\" for more detailed information regarding these pollution control bonds.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $1.8 billion of committed credit arrangements in place and $1.2 billion available under four separate credit facilities. These are reflected in the table below:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Committed Credit Facilities </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Authorized\nAmountd </td> <td> </td> <td>Available\n12/31/2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Expiration\nDate </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured Facilities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Syndicated Line among 12 banks led by CFC </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>691 </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>December 2024 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CFC Line of Credit(2)\n</td> <td>110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 2023 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>JPMorgan Chase Line of Credit </td> <td>363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>247 </td> <td> </td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>October 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured Facilities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CFC Term Loan(2)\n</td> <td>250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 2023 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Of the portion of this facility that was unavailable at December 31, 2020, $383 million was dedicated to support outstanding commercial paper and $136 million related to letters of credit issued to support variable rate demand bonds.\n(2)Any amounts drawn under the $110 million unsecured line of credit with CFC will reduce the amount that can be drawn under the $250 million secured term loan. Therefore, we reflect $140 million as the amount available under the term loan even though there are no amounts outstanding under that facility. Any amounts borrowed under the $250 million term loan would be secured under our first mortgage indenture, with a maturity no later than December 31, 2043.\n(3)Of the portion of this facility that was unavailable at December 31, 2020, $114 million related to letters of credit issued to support variable rate demand bonds and $2 million related to letters of credit issued to post collateral to third parties. We amended this credit facility in March 2020 to increase the authorized amount from $150 million to $363 million, which is committed through the maturity of this facility in October 2021.\nWe have the flexibility to use the $1.2 billion syndicated line of credit for several purposes, including borrowing for general corporate purposes, issuing letters of credit and backing up commercial paper.\nUnder our commercial paper program we are authorized to issue commercial paper in amounts that do not exceed the amount of any committed backup lines of credit, thereby providing 100% dedicated support for any commercial paper outstanding.\nUnder our unsecured committed lines of credit, we have the ability to issue letters of credit totaling $973 million in the aggregate, of which $721.6 million remained available at December 31, 2020. However, amounts related to issued letters of credit reduce the amount that would otherwise be available to draw for working capital needs. Also, due to the requirement to\nhave 100% dedicated backup for any commercial paper outstanding, any amounts drawn under our committed credit facilities for working capital or related to issued letters of credit will reduce the amount of commercial paper that we can issue. The majority of our outstanding letters of credit are for the purpose of providing credit enhancement on variable rate demand bonds.\nIn addition to providing liquidity for various other purposes, including the temporary purchase of pollution control bonds from time to time, we issue commercial paper to provide interim financing of costs related to the construction of Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 which we repay with the proceeds from long-term funding sources. Our loan guaranteed by the Department of Energy is our preferred source of long-term financing for eligible costs for Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4. See \"- Financing Activities\" and Note 7a in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Department of Energy-guaranteed loan. In August 2020, we used the proceeds from a $450 million issuance of first mortgage bonds to pay down commercial paper that was used for Vogtle construction.\nIn 2020, we borrowed $45.9 million under various Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed loans for general and environmental improvements.\nBetween projected cash on hand and the credit arrangements currently in place, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to cover normal operations and our interim financing needs, including interim financing for the new Vogtle units, until long-term financing is obtained.\nThree of our line of credit facilities contain similar financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum patronage capital levels. Currently, we are required to maintain minimum patronage capital of $750 million. As of December 31, 2020, our patronage capital balance was $1.1 billion. These agreements contain an additional covenant that limits our secured indebtedness and our unsecured indebtedness, both as defined in the credit agreements, to $14 billion and $4 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2020, we had $10.6 billion of secured indebtedness outstanding and $383.5 million of unsecured indebtedness outstanding.\nUnder our power bill prepayment program, members can prepay their power bills from us at a discount for an agreed number of months in advance, after which point the funds are credited against the participating members' monthly power bills. At December 31, 2020, we had nine members participating in the program and a balance of $144.2 million remaining to be applied against future power bills.\nIn addition to unrestricted available liquidity, at December 31, 2020 we had $487.6 million of restricted liquidity in connection with deposits made into a Rural Utilities Service Cushion of Credit Account. The Farm Bill passed by Congress in December 2018 modified the Cushion of Credit program. The program no longer accepts deposits and the interest rate earned on existing deposits will change over time. Existing deposits will continue to earn 4% until October 1, 2021, at which point deposits will earn the 1-year floating Treasury rate. Funds in the account, including interest thereon, can only be applied to debt service on Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed Federal Financing Bank notes. We will determine when to apply the remaining funds in the Cushion of Credit account.\nLiquidity Covenants. At December 31, 2020, we had only one financial agreement in place containing a liquidity covenant. This covenant is in connection with the Rocky Mountain lease transaction and requires us to maintain minimum liquidity of $50 million at all times during the term of the lease. We had sufficient liquidity to meet this covenant in 2020 and expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet this covenant in 2021. For a discussion of the Rocky Mountain lease transaction, see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancing Activities\nFirst Mortgage Indenture. At December 31, 2020, we had $10.6 billion of outstanding debt secured equally and ratably under our first mortgage indenture, an increase of $893.4 million from December 31, 2019. From time to time, we may issue additional first mortgage obligations ranking equally and ratably with the existing first mortgage indenture obligations. The aggregate principal amount of obligations that may be issued under the first mortgage indenture is not limited; however, our ability to issue additional obligations under the first mortgage indenture is subject to certain requirements related to the certified value of certain of our tangible property, repayment of obligations outstanding under the first mortgage indenture and payments made under certain pledged contracts relating to property to be acquired. As of December 31, 2020, the amount of certified bondable additions and retired or defeased first mortgage indenture obligations available for the issuance of additional first mortgage indenture obligations was approximately $2.0 billion. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had\nover $662 million of property additions and certified progress payments under qualified engineering, procurement and construction contracts that, once certified in accordance with the first mortgage indenture, will be available for the issuance of additional first mortgage indenture obligations.\nDepartment of Energy-Guaranteed Loans. We have loans from the Federal Financing Bank guaranteed by the Department of Energy to provide funding for over $4.6 billion of the cost to construct our 30% undivided share of Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4. At December 31, 2020, aggregate Department of Energy-guaranteed borrowings totaled $3.6 billion, including capitalized interest. All of the debt advanced under the loan guarantee agreement is secured ratably with all other debt under our first mortgage indenture. For additional information regarding these loans, see Note 7a of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCombined, this $4.6 billion and the $2.3 billion of debt we have raised in the capital markets represent long-term financing for more than 92% of our $7.5 billion project budget. We expect to raise long-term financing for the remaining amounts in the capital markets.\nIn accordance with the related promissory notes, we began principal repayments of our Department of Energy-guaranteed loans in February 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had repaid $79.1 million under these loans. If we fully advance these loans, we expect to repay a total of approximately $300 million in principal on these loans by November 2022. We plan to issue first mortgage bonds to refinance the principal repaid before the in-service date of Vogtle Unit No. 4.\nRural Utilities Service-Guaranteed Loans. In July 2020, we advanced the remaining $5.8 million under a $448.3 million Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed loan that was funded through the Federal Financing Bank. We currently have one approved Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed loan totaling $630.3 million to fund general and environmental improvements. We began borrowing from this loan in January 2021. As of December 31, 2020, we had $2.4 billion of debt outstanding under various Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed loans, a decrease of $96.1 million from December 31, 2019.\nAll of the approved Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed loans are funded through the Federal Financing Bank, and the debt is secured ratably with all other debt under our first mortgage indenture.\nBond Financings. As a result of the market conditions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, on April 1, 2020, we purchased for our own account $212.8 million of Series 2013 term-rate pollution control revenue bonds that were issued on our behalf by the Development Authorities of Appling, Burke and Monroe counties which were subject to mandatory tender. We increased our JPMorgan Chase line of credit by $213 million and drew this amount to fund the purchase. We subsequently repaid this line of credit borrowing with commercial paper, and in August 2020, we remarketed these bonds and used the proceeds to repay the outstanding commercial paper that had financed the purchase of these bonds. In August 2020, we also issued $450 million of taxable first mortgage bonds to repay commercial paper issued to fund a portion of the cost of constructing Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4.\nCapital Requirements\nCash Requirements. Our cash requirements relate primarily to operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service. As discussed under \"Sources of Capital and Liquidity,\" we fund our cash requirements through a mix of funds generated from operations and short- and long-term borrowings. For additional information regarding our contractual commitments, see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital Expenditures. As part of our ongoing capital planning, we forecast expenditures required for generating facilities and other capital projects. The table below details these forecasts for 2021 through 2023. Actual expenditures may vary from the estimates listed in the table because of factors such as changes in business conditions, design changes and\nrework required by regulatory bodies, delays in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, construction delays, changing environmental requirements, and changes in cost of capital, equipment, material and labor.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Expenditures(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future Generation(2)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>973 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,388 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Existing Generation(3)\n</td> <td>132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>384 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental Compliance(4)\n</td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nuclear Fuel(5)\n</td> <td>93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>286 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General Plant </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,112 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes allowance for funds used during construction.\n(2)Relates to construction of Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4, excluding initial nuclear fuel core.

Since alternative legislative and regulatory environmental compliance programs continue to be debated on a state and national level, we cannot predict what capital costs may ultimately be required. Therefore, environmental expenditures included in the above table only include amounts related to budgeted projects to comply with existing and certain well-defined rules and regulations and do not include amounts related to compliance with other, less certain rules.\nDepending on how we and the other co-owners of Plants Scherer and Wansley choose to comply with any future legislation or regulations, both capital expenditures and operating expenditures may be impacted. As required by the wholesale power contracts, we expect to be able to recover from our members all capital and operating expenditures made in complying with current and future environmental regulations.\nFor additional information regarding environmental regulation, see \"BUSINESS - REGULATION - Environmental.\"\nCredit Rating Risk\nThe table below sets forth our current ratings from S&P Global Ratings, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Our Ratings </td> <td>S&P </td> <td> </td> <td>Moody's </td> <td> </td> <td>Fitch </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term ratings: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured rating </td> <td>BBB+ </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa1 </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB+ </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuer/unsecured rating(1)\n</td> <td>BBB+ </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa2 </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB+ </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating outlook </td> <td>Negative </td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> <td>Negative </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term rating: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper rating </td> <td>A-2 </td> <td> </td> <td>P-2 </td> <td> </td> <td>F1 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)We currently have no long-term debt that is unsecured, however, pricing of our $1.2 billion syndicated line of credit is determined based on our unsecured or issuer ratings.\nWe have financial and other contractual agreements in place containing provisions which, upon a credit rating downgrade below specified levels, may require the posting of collateral in the form of letters of credit or other acceptable\ncollateral. Our primary exposure to potential collateral postings is at rating levels of BBB-/Baa3 or below. As of December 31, 2020, our maximum potential collateral requirements were as follows:\nAt senior secured rating levels:\n\u2022approximately $52 million at a senior secured level of BBB-/Baa3,\n\u2022approximately $93 million at a senior secured level of BB+/Ba1 or below, and\nAt senior unsecured or issuer rating levels:\n\u2022approximately $5.4 million at a senior unsecured or issuer level of BBB-/Baa3,\n\u2022approximately $62 million at a senior unsecured or issuer rating level of BB+/Ba1 or below.\nThe Rural Utilities Service Loan Contract contains covenants that, upon a credit rating downgrade below investment grade by two rating agencies, could result in restrictions on issuing debt. Certain of credit agreements and pollution control bond agreements contain provisions based on our ratings that, upon a credit rating downgrade below specified levels, could result in increased interest rates. Also, borrowing rates, letter of credit fees and commitment fees in two of our lines of credit agreements are based on credit ratings and could increase if our ratings are lowered. None of these covenants and provisions, however, would result in acceleration of any debt due to credit rating downgrades.\nGiven our current level of ratings, our management does not have any reason to expect a downgrade that would result in any material impacts to our business. However, our ratings reflect only the views of the rating agencies and we cannot give any assurance that our ratings will be maintained at current levels for any period of time.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Overview\nGeneral\nOur principal business is reliably providing wholesale electric service to our 38 members in a safe and cost-effective manner. Consequently, substantially all of our revenues and cash flow are derived from sales to our members pursuant to take-or-pay wholesale power contracts that extend through 2050. These contracts obligate our members jointly and severally to pay all of our costs and expenses associated with owning and operating our power supply business. To that end, our rate structure provides for a pass-through of actual energy costs. Charges for fixed costs, including capacity, other non-energy charges, debt service obligations and the margin required to meet our budgeted margins for interest ratio are carefully managed throughout the year to ensure that we collect sufficient capacity-related revenues. Our rate structure provides us with the ability to manage our revenues to assure full recovery of our costs and has enabled us consistently to meet our financial obligations since our formation in 1974.\n2020 Financial Results\nDespite the challenges and uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we had another successful year in 2020 and continue to be well positioned, both financially and operationally, to fulfill our obligations to our members, bondholders and creditors. Our revenues were more than sufficient to recover all of our costs and to satisfy all of our debt service obligations and financial covenants. Specifically, we recorded a net margin of $55.9 million in 2020, which achieved the 1.14 margins for interest ratio approved by our board of directors and exceeded the 1.10 margins for interest ratio required to meet the rate covenant under our first mortgage indenture. For 2021, we are again targeting a margins for interest ratio of 1.14, effectively increasing our annual margins by 40% over the minimum required level. We anticipate that we will continue to target a 1.14 margins for interest ratio through the remainder of the Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 construction period.\nAs a result of expanding our generation capacity and upgrading our generation facilities over the past decade, our total assets and total debt have significantly increased. At December 31, 2020, our total assets were $14.2 billion and total long-term debt was $10.6 billion. During the remainder of the Vogtle construction period, we expect that our assets and long-term debt will continue to increase. However, strategic financing and refinancing of capital investments with long-term debt through the Department of Energy and Rural Utilities Service loan guarantee programs, taxable and tax-exempt capital markets offerings and a continued low interest rate environment enabled us to borrow long-term debt at our lowest interest rates to date during 2020 and further decreased our weighted average interest cost on long-term debt from 5.41% per year at December 31, 2009 to 3.73% per year at December 31, 2020. We will continue to actively manage our debt portfolio and utilize advantageous borrowing programs available to us as our ability to borrow at lower costs ultimately benefits our members and their customers as interest savings are reflected in our pass-through rate structure.\nVogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4\nThe construction of Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 continues to be a primary focus area. Our current budget for our 30% ownership interest in these units is $7.5 billion, which includes capital costs, allowance for funds used during construction, our allocation of the project-level contingency and a separate Oglethorpe-level contingency. As of December 31, 2020, our total investment in the additional Vogtle units was $6.0 billion. The Georgia Public Service Commission approved in-service dates for Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 are November 2021 and November 2022, respectively.\nConstruction continues to make significant progress at the site and a number of important construction, system turnover and testing milestones were achieved during 2020. Southern Nuclear and Georgia Power continue to manage the construction at the site and maintained operations throughout 2020 while implementing comprehensive mitigation measures to manage the impact of COVID-19 at the site. Although construction activities continued, workforce disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing productivity challenges which have continued into 2021. As a result of these challenges, Southern Nuclear has further extended certain milestone dates, including the start of hot functional testing and fuel load for Unit No. 3. The Unit No. 3 schedule is challenged, and while the ability to achieve the November 2021 regulatory in-service date remains a target for Southern Nuclear, we believe a delay is likely which could add a month or more to the Unit No. 3\nin-service date. As Unit No. 3 approaches hot functional testing, key factors impacting the schedule include both the pace of work package completion and system turnovers, and required construction remediation work.\nAchievement of the November 2022 regulatory in-service date for Unit No. 4 primarily depends on overall construction productivity and production levels significantly improving as well as appropriate levels of craft laborers, particularly electrical and pipefitter craft labor, being added and maintained. In the event that there is any schedule extension beyond the November 2021 and November 2022 regulatory in-service dates for Units No. 3 and No. 4, respectively, the Oglethorpe-level contingency level in our current $7.5 billion budget is expected to be sufficient to withstand up to a 4-month delay for Unit No. 3 and a 3-month delay for Unit No. 4. Any further delays beyond these extended dates are expected to impact our cost by approximately $55 million per month for both units and approximately $25 million per month for Unit No. 4 only, including financing costs.\nUpon completion, Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 will have an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 2,200 megawatts and our 30% undivided interest will entitle us to approximately 660 megawatts of carbon-free, baseload generating capacity. We expect these units to be valuable assets for us and our members over the next 60 to 80 years and to contribute to our diverse pool of generation resources. For additional information regarding Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 and related financing activities, see BUSINESS - OUR POWER SUPPLY RESOURCES - Future Power Resources - Plant Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4,\u201d - Financial Condition - Financing Activities - Department of Energy-Guaranteed Loans\u201d and - Capital Requirements - Capital Expenditures\u201d and Note 7a of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCOVID-19\nWe were able to successfully navigate the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 and are proud of our associates' response to the outbreak. As an electric utility, we are deemed part of the nation's critical infrastructure and continued operating during the pandemic to provide electricity to our members and the populations they serve. To protect our associates and the public and to maintain operating capabilities, we implemented applicable business continuity plans, including working remotely where possible; increased cleaning frequency at business locations; implemented applicable safety and health guidelines issued by federal and state officials; and established protocols to maintain generation reliability. In June, we began a phased reopening of our corporate offices with new safety protocols intended to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19. To date, these measures have been effective in maintaining our critical operations and we continue to keep in contact with state and federal regulators to ensure the safety of our associates and reliability of our generation facilities.\nWhile there were temporary disruptions in the capital and equity markets over the course of the year, the COVID pandemic did not have a significant effect on our business operations or financial condition. For 2020, our analysis indicates that the impact of COVID-19 on our members' sales was approximately one percent. The potential decrease in sales was mitigated by the fact that approximately two-thirds of our members' sales are to residential customers. Further, although our members were subject to an increased risk that their consumers may not be able to pay utility bills on time or may seek to enter into alternative payment plans, our members have continued to pay all amounts due under the wholesale power contracts on a timely basis and we are not aware of a significant increase of bad debt with any of our members. While we are encouraged by the increasing distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines, the ultimate impact of the pandemic on us and our members remains subject to many factors, including the timing of achieving a sufficient level of vaccinations and the remaining duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions.\nLiquidity Position\nOur strong liquidity position continues to be one of the most positive attributes contributing to our solid financial standing. This liquidity is comprised of a diversified, cost-effective mix of cash (including short-term investments), committed lines of credit and commercial paper. Our primary source of liquidity is a $1.2 billion unsecured credit facility that extends through December 2024 and supports our commercial paper program. Additionally, we have three other bank credit facilities which provide another $613 million in credit commitments, including a $363 million line of credit from J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, which we increased from $150 million in March 2020.\nIn addition to our strong liquidity, we have multiple sources of long-term financing available to meet our anticipated capital needs. These sources include Department of Energy and Rural Utilities Service federal loan programs and the taxable\nand tax-exempt capital markets. We expect to continue utilizing each of these sources of capital to meet our long-term financing needs in the coming years.\nWith our current sources of committed short-term and long-term funding, we anticipate that we will have sufficient liquidity to complete Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nAnother of our key focus areas is maintaining compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulatory standards. We own electric generation facilities powered by nuclear, natural gas, coal and hydro resources which presents substantial challenges for us and our members to comply with existing environmental regulations. Based on the new presidential administration's executive orders, statements regarding reducing carbon dioxide emissions and decision to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, we expect existing environmental regulations to become more stringent. As an electric cooperative that operates on a not-for-profit basis, our compliance costs are ultimately borne by our members' electricity consumers.\nGreenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, are again the focus of increased federal environmental regulations. Effective February 19, 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement and will develop proposed reductions in carbon dioxide which could lead to legislative and regulatory actions to support those goals. The EPA is expected to undertake a new rulemaking process to address carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants following the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's decision to vacate and remand the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule. At this time we cannot predict the outcome or potential cost of any legislative or regulatory changes on us or our members but it could be significant. We also believe that we are well-situated to effectively manage such challenges and that our diverse asset base, along with our investment in additional carbon-free generation at Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4, positions us well to continue to meet our members' needs. Further, our members continue to pursue renewable generation opportunities and invest where they deem appropriate in order to further diversify their power supply resources to meet the demands of their member consumers and prepare for potential future limitations on greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn addition to greenhouse gases, we must also comply with several other environmental regulations. For example, in order to comply with federal and state coal combustion residual rules and effluent limitation guidelines, we are investing approximately $289 million in capital costs, of which $242 million has already been spent, in addition to $400 million to $550 million (in year of expenditure dollars) associated with our corresponding asset retirement obligations. If existing laws or regulations related to the disposal of CCR and treatment of coal ash ponds were to change or we are otherwise required to revise our existing closure plans, our related obligations could increase materially.\nAsset Management\nAnother of our primary focus areas continues to be ensuring that our owned and operated generation facilities perform in the most efficient and cost-effective manner possible and, in 2021, we will continue to seek ways to improve the reliability of our generating facilities. Our Operational Excellence program strives to achieve safety, reliability and compliance in a cost effective manner. Many of the generation facilities we operate rank in the top quartile of similar plants in one or more key performance indicators, including start reliability, peak season availability and forced outages. Additionally, our generation assets are built and designed to operate in extreme winter weather. Following the 2014 polar vortex, we implemented design improvements across our fleet of power plants to safeguard against subzero temperatures and ensure reliable generation resources for our members. Achieving operational excellence results in the most reliable, efficient and lowest cost power supply for our members; therefore, effective asset management will always be one of our top priorities.\nAs we assess the operation of our existing generation resources, a continued trend in the dispatch of our generation assets is the significant decrease in coal-fired generation. The percentage of energy from coal generation that we supply to our members has decreased from 45% in 2008 to 5% in 2020. The two primary drivers of this shift in generation were our acquisition of additional natural gas-fired resources and a significant fall in natural gas prices. As a result of this trend and capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations, Georgia Power is evaluating whether to retire Plant Wansley Units No. 1 and No. 2 as early as fall 2022. As we look ahead, we continue to consider the role that coal-fired generation resources play in our overall portfolio and the ability to provide reliable and cost-effective generation for our members.\nIn addition to our current assets, we continue to evaluate potential resources to meet our members' needs at the lowest reasonable cost. On March 1, 2021, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire Effingham County Power, a 511-megawatt natural gas-fired combined cycle peaking facility that is subject to customary closing terms and conditions. If completed, this acquisition would provide an additional efficient and economically priced generation resource to our members.\nRate Management Programs\nOver the last five years, our average wholesale power rate to our members has been at or below the mid-six cents per kilowatt-hour range. Given the magnitude of the Vogtle project, we and some of our members have voluntarily implemented various rate management programs to smooth out the impact on rates when Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 reach commercial operation.\nBeginning in 2018, we offered our members an optional rate management program allowing for an election of additional collections of future expenses for a five-year period which will then be applied to billings over the subsequent five-year period. For participating members, the additional collections will have the effect of gradually increasing their payments to us over the initial five year period, 2018 to 2022, in order to soften the impact of full integration of the new Vogtle units' costs into rates. In 2023 to 2025, the first few full years after expected commercial operation of the Vogtle units, we will apply a portion of the additional amounts collected to participating members' bills, which we expect to reduce the rate impact to those members by approximately one-half of a cent each year, from the mid-seven cents per kilowatt-hour range to around seven cents per kilowatt-hour. The impact of the program will gradually decrease through 2027, its final year. Further, because we only supply around 60% of our members' wholesale power requirements, the ultimate rate impact on the retail consumers may be further mitigated as our members' rates are blended with their supplemental power supply sources, transmission and retail distribution costs.\nOutlook for 2021\nAs the electric utility industry across the country continues to experience change, we remain focused on providing reliable, safe, and cost-effective energy to our members and the 4.3 million people they serve and believe we are well positioned to do so. As discussed above, there are certain risks and challenges that we must continue to address, most notably related to Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 and anticipated environmental regulation. However, as we manage our risks, we intend to keep doing what we have done so successfully for the last 47 years, including, among other things:\n\u2022maintaining a balanced and diverse portfolio of generating resources, including nuclear, natural gas, coal and hydro and continuing the efficient and cost-effective operation of these resources;\n\u2022maintaining strong liquidity to fulfill current obligations and to finance future capital expenditures; and\n\u2022working with our members to explore existing and emerging opportunities to add value to our ultimate consumers.\nAccounting Policies\nBasis of Accounting\nWe follow generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and the practices prescribed in the Uniform System of Accounts of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as modified and adopted by the Rural Utilities Service.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe have determined that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations and requires our management to make estimates and assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time of the preparation of our financial statements. Changes in these estimates and assumptions by our management could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition. Our management has discussed these critical accounting policies and the related estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of our board of directors.\nRegulatory Accounting. We are subject to the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) authoritative guidance issued regarding regulated operations. The guidance permits us to record regulatory assets and\nregulatory liabilities to reflect future cost recoveries or refunds, respectively, that we have a right to pass through to our members. At December 31, 2020, our regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities totaled $731.4 million and $566.4 million, respectively. While we do not currently foresee any events such as competition or other factors that would make it not probable that we will recover these costs from our members as future revenues through rates under our wholesale power contracts, if such an event were to occur, we could no longer apply the provisions of accounting for regulated operations, which would require us to eliminate all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities that had been recognized as a charge or credit to our statement of revenues and expenses and begin recognizing assets and liabilities in a manner similar to other businesses in general. In addition, we would be required to determine any impairment to other assets, including plants, and write-down those assets, if impaired, to their fair values.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. Accounting for asset retirement and environmental obligations requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at fair value when incurred and capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset. In the absence of quoted market prices, we estimate the fair value of our asset retirement obligations using present value techniques, in which estimates of future cash flows associated with retirement activities are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures includes, among other things, making projections of when assets will be retired and ultimately decommissioned, the amount of decommissioning costs, and how costs will escalate with inflation.\nA significant portion of our asset retirement obligations relates to our share of the future cost to decommission our operating nuclear units and the coal ash ponds at our coal-fired units. At December 31, 2020, our nuclear decommissioning and coal ash related asset retirement obligations were $738.2 million and $346.6 million, respectively. Our asset retirement obligations represent an estimate of the present value of anticipated retirement costs. For additional detail regarding our asset retirement obligations, see Note 1h of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These obligations represented 95% of our total asset retirement obligations.\nGiven its significance, we consider our nuclear decommissioning liabilities critical estimates. Approximately every three years, new decommissioning studies for Plants Hatch and Vogtle are performed. These studies provide us with periodic site-specific \"base year\" cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost and timing of planned decommissioning activities for the plants. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows for extended periods are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual costs. In addition, these estimates are dependent on subjective factors, including the selection of cost escalation and discount rates, which we consider to be critical assumptions. Our current estimates are based upon studies that were performed in 2018. For ratemaking purposes, we record decommissioning costs over the expected service life of each unit. The impact on measurements of asset retirement obligations using different assumptions in the future may be significant.\nWe also consider our coal ash related decommissioning liabilities at Plants Scherer and Wansley to be critical estimates, in particular those for the coal ash ponds. Cost studies are periodically performed to provide site-specific \"base year\" estimates that determine the nature and timing of planned decommissioning costs. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows for extended periods are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual costs. Critical assumptions include coal ash pond closure strategy, including water treatment requirements, and the volume of coal ash in the ponds. In addition, these estimates are dependent on other subjective factors, such as estimates of costs to perform the decommissioning and post-closure activities, timing of expenditures, and the selection of cost escalation and discount rates. Our current estimates are based upon studies that were performed in 2019. For ratemaking purposes, we are applying regulated operations accounting to the decommissioning costs and currently expect to recover ash pond closure costs over approximately 12 years. The impact on measurements of asset retirement obligations using different assumptions in the future may be significant.\nRecently issued or adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\u201d. The amendments in this update apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The amendments in this update provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments in this update do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for hedging\nrelationships existing as of December 31, 2022, for which an entity has elected certain optional expedients that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship.\nIn January 2021, the FASB issued Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope,\u201d to further clarify the scope of the reference rate reform guidance in Topic 848. The amendments in this update refine the scope of Topic 848 to clarify that certain optional expedients and exceptions therein for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to contracts that are affected by the discounting transition. Specifically, modifications related to reference rate reform would not be considered an event that requires reassessment of previous accounting conclusions. The amendments in this update also amend the expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 to capture the incremental consequences of the scope clarification and to tailor the existing guidance to derivative instruments affected by the discounting transition.\nThe amendments in these updates are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating the future impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued \"Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\" The standard was effective for us prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods therein. On January 1, 2020, we adopted this standard. The standard requires consideration of a broad range of information to estimate expected credit losses over the lifetime of financial assets measured at amortized cost. The new credit losses standard replaced the incurred loss\u201d methodology for recognizing credit losses that delayed recognition until it was probable a loss had been incurred. The financial assets we hold that are subject to the new standard are predominately accounts receivable and certain cash equivalents classified as held-to-maturity debt (e.g. commercial paper). Our receivables are generally due within thirty days or less with a significant portion related to billings to our members. See Notes 1e and 1f for information regarding our member receivables. Commercial paper issuances we invest in are rated as investment grade and backed by a credit facility. Given our historical experience, the short duration lifetime of these financial assets and the short time horizon over which to consider expectations of future economic conditions, we have assessed that non-collection of the cost basis of these financial assets is remote. The adoption of the standard did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued \"Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.\" This standard eliminated, added and modified certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements as part of the FASB's disclosure framework project. Entities are no longer required to disclose the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the policy for timing of transfers between levels and the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. However, public business entities are required to disclose the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. The amendments in this update were effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. An entity was permitted to early adopt any removed or modified disclosures upon issuance of this update and delay adoption of the additional disclosures until their effective date. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\u201d, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in the accounting standards. The amendments in the standard remove certain exceptions and also clarify and simplify various aspects of accounting for income taxes. The new standard is effective for us prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted, which we are not electing to do. The adoption of the standard on January 1, 2021 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nSummary of Cooperative Operations\nSources of Revenues\nWe operate on a not-for-profit basis and, accordingly, seek only to generate revenues sufficient to recover our cost of service and to generate margins sufficient to establish reasonable reserves and meet certain financial coverage requirements. Our primary source of revenue is the sale of capacity and energy to our members for a portion of their energy requirements. We may also sell capacity and energy to non-members. Capacity revenues are the revenues we receive for providing electric service whether or not our generation and purchased power resources are dispatched to produce electricity. Energy revenues are the revenues we receive by selling electricity that we generate or purchase.\nWe have assigned fixed percentage capacity cost responsibilities to our members for all of our generation and purchased power resources. Each member has contractually agreed to pay us for the electric capacity assigned to it based on its individual fixed percentage capacity cost responsibility.\nEach member is also contractually obligated to pay us for electric energy we provide to it based on individual usage. Energy sales to our members fluctuate from period to period based on several factors, including fuel costs, weather and other seasonal factors, load requirements in the service territories of our members, operating costs, availability of electric generation resources and our decisions of whether to dispatch our owned or purchased resources or member-owned resources over which we have dispatch rights. In addition, as we do not provide our members with all of their energy requirements, energy sales may also fluctuate based on our members' decisions of whether to purchase a portion of their hourly energy requirements from our resources or from other suppliers.\nFormulary Rate\nThe rates we charge our members are designed to cover all of our costs plus a margin. This cost-plus rate structure is set forth as a formula in the rate schedule to the wholesale power contracts between us and each of our members. These contracts require us to design capacity and energy rates that generate revenues sufficient to recover all costs, including payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, to establish and maintain reasonable margins and to meet the financial coverage requirements under the first mortgage indenture.\nThe formulary rate provides for the pass through of our fixed costs to members as capacity charges and our variable costs to members as energy charges. Fixed costs are assigned to members according to their individual fixed percentage capacity cost responsibility for each resource in which they participate. Variable costs are passed through to our members based on the amount of energy supplied to each member.\nCapacity charges are based on an annual budget of fixed costs plus a targeted margin and are billed to members in equal monthly installments over the course of the year. Fixed costs include items such as depreciation, interest, fixed operations and maintenance expenses, administrative and general expenses. We monitor fixed cost budget variances to projected actual costs throughout the year, and with board approval, make budget adjustments when and as necessary to ensure that we generate revenues sufficient to recover all costs and to meet our targeted margin. Budget adjustments are typically made twice a year; once during the first quarter and again at year end. In contrast to the way we bill our members for capacity charges, which are billed based on a budget and trued up to actuals by the end of the year, energy charges are billed on a more real-time basis. Estimated energy charges are billed to members based on the amount of energy supplied to each member during the month, and are adjusted when actual costs are available, generally the following month. Energy charges, or variable costs, include fuel, purchased energy and variable operations and maintenance expenses. Each generating resource has a different variable cost profile, and members are billed based on the energy cost profile of the resources from which their energy is supplied.\nMargins\nRevenues in excess of current period costs in any year are designated as net margin in our statements of revenues and expenses and we have generated a positive net margin every year since our formation in 1974. Under our first mortgage indenture, we are required, subject to any necessary regulatory approval, to establish and collect rates that are reasonably expected, together with our other revenues, to yield a margins for interest ratio for each fiscal year equal to at least 1.10. See \"BUSINESS - OGLETHORPE POWER CORPORATION - First Mortgage Indenture\" for a discussion of how we calculate our margins for interest ratio.\nIn the event we were to fall short of the minimum 1.10 margins for interest ratio at year end, the formulary rate is designed to recover the shortfall from our members in the following year without any additional action by our board of directors.\nPrior to 2009, we budgeted and achieved annual margins for interest ratios of 1.10, the minimum required by the first mortgage indenture. To enhance margin coverage during a period of increased capital requirements, our board of directors has approved budgets with margins for interest ratios that exceeded 1.10. Since 2010, we have achieved our board approved margins for interest ratio of 1.14, and our board has approved a margins for interest ratio of 1.14 for 2021. As our capital requirements continue to evolve, our board will continue to evaluate the level of margin coverage and may choose to change the targeted margins for interest ratio in the future, although not below 1.10.\nPatronage Capital\nRetained net margins are designated on our balance sheets as patronage capital. As a cooperative, patronage capital constitutes our principal equity. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.1 billion in patronage capital and membership fees. Our equity ratio, calculated pursuant to our first mortgage indenture as patronage capital and membership fees divided by total capitalization and long-term debt due within one year, was 9.1% and 9.4% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nPatronage capital is allocated to each of our members on the basis of their fixed percentage capacity responsibilities in our generation resources. Any distribution of patronage capital is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and limitations under our first mortgage indenture. See \"BUSINESS - OGLETHORPE POWER CORPORATION - First Mortgage Indenture\" for a discussion regarding limitations on distributions under our first mortgage indenture.\nRate Regulation\nUnder our loan agreements with each of the Rural Utilities Service and Department of Energy, changes to our rates resulting from adjustments in our annual budget are generally not subject to their approval. We must provide the Rural Utilities Service and Department of Energy with a notice of and opportunity to object to most changes to the formulary rate under the wholesale power contracts. See \"BUSINESS - OGLETHORPE POWER CORPORATION - Relationship with Federal Lenders.\" Currently, our rates are not subject to the approval of any other federal or state agency or authority, including the Georgia Public Service Commission.\nTax Status\nWhile we are a not-for-profit membership corporation formed under the laws of Georgia, we are subject to federal and state income taxation. As a taxable cooperative, we are allowed to deduct patronage dividends that we allocate to our members for purposes of calculating our taxable income. We annually allocate income and deductions between patronage and non-patronage activities and substantially all of our income is from patronage-sourced activities, resulting in no current period income tax expense or current income tax liability. For further discussion of our taxable status, see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nFactors Affecting Results\nCertain of our recent financial and operational results were affected both by the way in which we dispatch our power plants as well as by significant events or trends described below.\nWe have a diverse mix of generation and fuel types among our power plants, allowing us to serve the power needs of our members in a reliable, efficient and low-cost manner. The types of generation assets we own include several natural gas-fired simple cycle combustion turbine plants, two combined cycle natural gas-fired plants, a plant that burns bituminous coal, a plant that burns sub-bituminous coal, two nuclear plants and a pumped storage hydroelectric plant.\nDecisions to dispatch our power plants and thus the amount of energy we generate and sell to our members are economically driven by supply and demand considerations. The primary supply considerations include (i) fuel prices and other marginal operating costs of the plant, which factor into a dispatch cost we calculate for each resource, (ii) plant availability, which is driven by factors such as outages for maintenance or refuelings and (iii) plant efficiency, as determined by the heat rate which measures the amount of fuel required to generate one kilowatt hour of electricity. We prioritize the order in which we dispatch our plants such that we dispatch our available plants with the lowest dispatch cost first, and those with the highest dispatch cost last, when demand is highest. The primary demand consideration that affects how we dispatch our plants is the amount of energy our members require from us. This is a function of weather, economic activity, residential use patterns and the relative cost and availability of our members' third party supply arrangements, which account for a significant portion of the energy they purchase. In 2020, our energy generation and member sales were down by approximately 5% when compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to milder weather in the winter and summer, with only about 1% related to reduced demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSince we pass through all of our costs to members, including fuel cost, which is one of our most significant operating costs, the cost of our energy sales to our members is significantly affected by fuel prices. The price of natural gas is the most\nsignificant variable in our cost of fuel and also affects how we dispatch our generation resources. Natural gas prices were relatively low in 2018 and 2019, and continued to trend downward in 2020. In addition to the prevailing market price, our average cost of natural gas per kilowatt hour generated is also affected by how efficiently our natural gas facilities burn the gas. Compared to our combined cycle units, our combustion turbine units are less efficient and thus burn more gas per kilowatt hour of electricity generated. Consequently, our combustion turbine units have a higher dispatch cost than our combined cycle units and are typically used to generate energy only during periods of higher electricity demand, such as on hot summer days. In 2020, generation from our combustion turbine units was less than in 2019 due to the aforementioned mild weather.\nAs a result of the low natural gas price environment, our coal units have become less economical and are generating less energy to sell to our members. In 2020, generation from our coal units was 5% of our gross total energy generation compared to 10% in 2019 and 16% in 2018.\nOur nuclear units require refueling on an 18 to 24-month cycle and these refueling outages, which typically last several weeks, resulted in fluctuations in nuclear plant availability and generation in each of the last three years. These shutdowns and outages significantly reduced generation at the affected plants, reduced kilowatt-hour sales to and energy revenues from our members during the periods that the plants were not generating power.\nOur energy sales to our members also fluctuate from period to period based on weather. For 2020, the winter was very mild and summer was moderately milder when compared to the prior ten year average. The mild weather largely contributed to the decrease in energy sales in 2020 compared to 2019. However, in July our members experienced a peak just short of the all-time peak demand that occurred in August 2019. This was a result of warmer than normal weather in July combined with many of our members' residential customers working remotely from home and commercial loads returning to pre-COVID-19 levels.\nWe also continued to make significant capital expenditures over the past three years, particularly for the new units under construction at Plant Vogtle, which we have primarily financed with debt. These financings have increased our overall debt which has increased our interest expense and our allowance for debt funds used during construction. Additionally, since our margin is calculated as a percentage of our secured interest expense, our net margin has generally increased. As discussed under \"- Financial Condition - Capital Resources - Capital Expenditures,\" we expect significant capital expenditures to continue through the completion of the additional units at Plant Vogtle.\nNet Margin\nOur net margin for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $55.9 million, $54.5 million and $51.2 million, respectively. These amounts produced a margins for interest ratio of 1.14 in each of 2020, 2019 and 2018. For additional information on our margin requirement, see \"- Summary of Cooperative Operations - Rate Regulation.\"\nOperating Revenues\nSales to Members. We generate revenues principally from the sale of electric capacity and energy to our members. Capacity revenues are the revenues we receive for electric service whether or not our generation and purchased power resources are dispatched to produce electricity. These revenues are designed to recover the fixed costs associated with our business, including fixed production expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses and interest charges, plus a targeted margin. Energy revenues are the sales of electricity generated or purchased for our members. Energy revenues recover the variable costs of our business, including fuel, purchased energy and variable operation and maintenance expense.\nThe components of member revenues were as follows:\n\nCapacity revenues increased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the recovery of higher fixed production costs. The slight increase in capacity revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 was due primarily to the recovery of depreciation and accretion expenses. For a discussion of production costs and depreciation and accretion expense, see \"- Operating Expenses.\"\nThe 16.8% decrease in energy revenues from members in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily a result of a decrease in total fuel expense, including a decrease in generation for member sales. Energy revenues from members in 2019 compared to 2018 decreased 11.6% due to a decrease in total fuel expense, offset by a slight increase in generation for member sales. For a discussion of fuel expense, see \"- Operating Expenses.\"\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses decreased 4.4% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to a decline in fuel costs, and offset by an increase in production costs. In 2019 compared to 2018, operating expenses decreased 3.4% primarily due to a decline in fuel costs, offset by an increase in depreciation and accretion.\nThe following table summarizes our net kilowatt-hour (kWh) generation and fuel costs by generating source.\n Cost Generation Cents per kWh (dollars in thousands) (kWh in thousands) Fuel Source 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs. % Change 2019 vs. % Change 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs. % Change 2019 vs. % Change 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs. % Change 2019 vs. % Change Coal $ 40,222 $ 80,706 $ 119,459 (50.2) % (32.4) % 1,137,027 2,592,023 4,062,982 (56.1) % (36.2) % 3.54 3.11 2.94 13.6 % 5.9 % Nuclear 75,968 79,893 85,949 (4.9) % (7.0) % 9,832,564 10,061,609 10,314,928 (2.3) % (2.5) % 0.77 0.79 0.83 (2.7) % (4.8) % Natural Gas: Combined Cycle 202,030 225,816 240,122 (10.5) % (6.0) % 10,473,139 9,649,561 8,047,494 8.5 % 19.9 % 1.93 2.34 2.98 (17.6) % (21.5) % Combustion Turbine 42,034 53,799 57,374 (21.9) % (6.2) % 1,386,569 1,562,895 1,271,542 (11.3) % 22.9 % 3.03 3.44 4.51 (11.9) % (23.7) % $ 360,254 $ 440,214 $ 502,904 (18.2) % (12.5) % 22,829,299 23,866,088 23,696,946 (4.3) % 0.7 % 1.58 1.84 2.12 (14.4) % (13.2) % \nTotal fuel expense decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily as a result of lower natural gas prices, which also contributed to a shift in generation from coal-fired plants to more economical natural gas-fired plants. Included in total fuel expense were $20.3 million of losses in 2020 and $9.1 million of losses in 2019 incurred for the settlement of natural gas financial contracts we utilize to manage our exposure to fluctuations in market prices. Total generation increased slightly in 2019 compared to 2018.\nProduction costs can vary due to the number and extent of outages in a given year. Production costs increased 4.3% in 2020 compared to 2019 and decreased 1.7% in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in 2020 was due to planned major maintenance outages at Plant Smith during the year. The decrease in 2019 was due to a reduction in fixed and variable maintenance costs driven by outages during the prior year.\nOther Income\nTotal other income decreased 21.0% in 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of lower investment balances and lower interest rates. The 6.0% decrease in other income in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to losses realized on the retirement of certain leasehold improvements.\nInterest Charges\nAllowance for debt funds used during construction increased in 2020 and 2019 primarily due to increased borrowings or Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 construction expenditures.\nFinancial Condition\nOverview\nConsistent with our budgeted margin for 2020, we achieved a 1.14 margins for interest ratio which produced a net margin of $55.9 million. This net margin increased our total patronage capital (our equity) and membership fees to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2020. Our 2021 budget again targets a 1.14 margins for interest ratio.\nOur equity to total capitalization ratio, as defined in our first mortgage indenture, was 9.1% at December 31, 2020 and 9.4% at December 31, 2019. We anticipate that our equity ratio will remain around its current level during the remainder of the Vogtle construction period; however, the absolute level of patronage capital will continue to increase.\nWe had a strong liquidity position at December 31, 2020 with $1.6 billion of unrestricted available liquidity, including $405.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. We issued commercial paper throughout the year to provide interim financing for the Plant Vogtle construction and for other purposes at a low cost. The average cost of funds on the $383.5 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2020 was 0.3%.\nOur total assets increased to $14.2 billion at December 31, 2020 from $13.0 billion at December 31, 2019. For the past several years, our total assets have shown significant increases due to increases in construction work in progress in connection with the additional nuclear units under construction at Plant Vogtle.\nProperty additions during 2020 totaled $1.3 billion. These additions include costs related to the construction of the new Vogtle units, environmental control facilities being installed at coal-fired Plants Scherer and Wansley, normal additions and replacements to existing generation facilities and purchases of nuclear fuel.\nThere was a net increase in long-term debt and finance leases of $887.3 million at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. The weighted average interest rate on the $10.6 billion of long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 was 3.73%.\nSources of Capital and Liquidity\nSources of Capital. We fund our capital requirements through a combination of funds generated from operations and short-term and long-term borrowings. See \"- Capital Requirements - Capital Expenditures\" for more detailed information regarding our estimated capital expenditures.\nWe have $4.6 billion of loans from the Federal Financing Bank that are guaranteed by the Department of Energy. These loans provide funding for a portion of our cost to construct our 30% interest in the two new nuclear units at Plant Vogtle. As of December 31, 2020, we had $3.6 billion outstanding under these loans and may draw the remaining amounts through November 2023.\nHistorically, we have also obtained a substantial portion of our long-term financing from Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed loans funded by the Federal Financing Bank. However, Rural Utilities Service funding levels for projects we may choose to undertake are uncertain and may be limited in the future due to budgetary and political pressures faced by Congress. Because of these factors, we cannot predict the amount or cost of Rural Utilities Service loans that may be available to us in the future.\nWe have also issued a substantial amount of taxable and tax-exempt debt in the capital markets. If the Rural Utilities Service loan program were to be curtailed or eliminated or if we are unable to draw the full amount of the Department of Energy-guaranteed loan, we believe we are well positioned to continue to access capital market financings. See \"- Financing Activities\" for more detailed information regarding our financing plans.\nSee Note 7 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these loans.\nSee \"BUSINESS - OGLETHORPE POWER CORPORATION - Relationship with Federal Lenders\" for further discussion of our relationship with the Department of Energy and Rural Utilities Service.\nLiquidity. At December 31, 2020, we had $1.6 billion of unrestricted available liquidity to meet short-term cash needs and liquidity requirements, consisting of $405.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.2 billion of unused and available committed credit arrangements.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $511.4 million in 2020, and averaged $450.8 million per year for the three-year period 2018 through 2020.\nWe monitor our anticipated liquidity needs to ensure that our credit facility portfolio appropriately covers our anticipated needs. In March 2020, we amended our $150 million line of credit with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank to increase the commitment to $363 million, and used this line of credit, and subsequently commercial paper, to temporarily finance the purchase of $212.8 million of pollution control bonds that were subject to mandatory tender on April 1, 2020. In August 2020 we remarketed the pollution control bonds and used the proceeds to repay these borrowings. See \"- Financing Activities - Bond Financings\" for more detailed information regarding these pollution control bonds.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $1.8 billion of committed credit arrangements in place and $1.2 billion available under four separate credit facilities. These are reflected in the table below:\n\n(1)Of the portion of this facility that was unavailable at December 31, 2020, $383 million was dedicated to support outstanding commercial paper and $136 million related to letters of credit issued to support variable rate demand bonds.\n(2)Any amounts drawn under the $110 million unsecured line of credit with CFC will reduce the amount that can be drawn under the $250 million secured term loan. Therefore, we reflect $140 million as the amount available under the term loan even though there are no amounts outstanding under that facility. Any amounts borrowed under the $250 million term loan would be secured under our first mortgage indenture, with a maturity no later than December 31, 2043.\n(3)Of the portion of this facility that was unavailable at December 31, 2020, $114 million related to letters of credit issued to support variable rate demand bonds and $2 million related to letters of credit issued to post collateral to third parties. We amended this credit facility in March 2020 to increase the authorized amount from $150 million to $363 million, which is committed through the maturity of this facility in October 2021.\nWe have the flexibility to use the $1.2 billion syndicated line of credit for several purposes, including borrowing for general corporate purposes, issuing letters of credit and backing up commercial paper.\nUnder our commercial paper program we are authorized to issue commercial paper in amounts that do not exceed the amount of any committed backup lines of credit, thereby providing 100% dedicated support for any commercial paper outstanding.\nUnder our unsecured committed lines of credit, we have the ability to issue letters of credit totaling $973 million in the aggregate, of which $721.6 million remained available at December 31, 2020. However, amounts related to issued letters of credit reduce the amount that would otherwise be available to draw for working capital needs. Also, due to the requirement to\nhave 100% dedicated backup for any commercial paper outstanding, any amounts drawn under our committed credit facilities for working capital or related to issued letters of credit will reduce the amount of commercial paper that we can issue. The majority of our outstanding letters of credit are for the purpose of providing credit enhancement on variable rate demand bonds.\nIn addition to providing liquidity for various other purposes, including the temporary purchase of pollution control bonds from time to time, we issue commercial paper to provide interim financing of costs related to the construction of Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4 which we repay with the proceeds from long-term funding sources. Our loan guaranteed by the Department of Energy is our preferred source of long-term financing for eligible costs for Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4. See \"- Financing Activities\" and Note 7a in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Department of Energy-guaranteed loan. In August 2020, we used the proceeds from a $450 million issuance of first mortgage bonds to pay down commercial paper that was used for Vogtle construction.\nIn 2020, we borrowed $45.9 million under various Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed loans for general and environmental improvements.\nBetween projected cash on hand and the credit arrangements currently in place, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to cover normal operations and our interim financing needs, including interim financing for the new Vogtle units, until long-term financing is obtained.\nThree of our line of credit facilities contain similar financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum patronage capital levels. Currently, we are required to maintain minimum patronage capital of $750 million. As of December 31, 2020, our patronage capital balance was $1.1 billion. These agreements contain an additional covenant that limits our secured indebtedness and our unsecured indebtedness, both as defined in the credit agreements, to $14 billion and $4 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2020, we had $10.6 billion of secured indebtedness outstanding and $383.5 million of unsecured indebtedness outstanding.\nUnder our power bill prepayment program, members can prepay their power bills from us at a discount for an agreed number of months in advance, after which point the funds are credited against the participating members' monthly power bills. At December 31, 2020, we had nine members participating in the program and a balance of $144.2 million remaining to be applied against future power bills.\nIn addition to unrestricted available liquidity, at December 31, 2020 we had $487.6 million of restricted liquidity in connection with deposits made into a Rural Utilities Service Cushion of Credit Account. The Farm Bill passed by Congress in December 2018 modified the Cushion of Credit program. The program no longer accepts deposits and the interest rate earned on existing deposits will change over time. Existing deposits will continue to earn 4% until October 1, 2021, at which point deposits will earn the 1-year floating Treasury rate. Funds in the account, including interest thereon, can only be applied to debt service on Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed Federal Financing Bank notes. We will determine when to apply the remaining funds in the Cushion of Credit account.\nLiquidity Covenants. At December 31, 2020, we had only one financial agreement in place containing a liquidity covenant. This covenant is in connection with the Rocky Mountain lease transaction and requires us to maintain minimum liquidity of $50 million at all times during the term of the lease. We had sufficient liquidity to meet this covenant in 2020 and expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet this covenant in 2021. For a discussion of the Rocky Mountain lease transaction, see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancing Activities\nFirst Mortgage Indenture. At December 31, 2020, we had $10.6 billion of outstanding debt secured equally and ratably under our first mortgage indenture, an increase of $893.4 million from December 31, 2019. From time to time, we may issue additional first mortgage obligations ranking equally and ratably with the existing first mortgage indenture obligations. The aggregate principal amount of obligations that may be issued under the first mortgage indenture is not limited; however, our ability to issue additional obligations under the first mortgage indenture is subject to certain requirements related to the certified value of certain of our tangible property, repayment of obligations outstanding under the first mortgage indenture and payments made under certain pledged contracts relating to property to be acquired. As of December 31, 2020, the amount of certified bondable additions and retired or defeased first mortgage indenture obligations available for the issuance of additional first mortgage indenture obligations was approximately $2.0 billion. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had\nover $662 million of property additions and certified progress payments under qualified engineering, procurement and construction contracts that, once certified in accordance with the first mortgage indenture, will be available for the issuance of additional first mortgage indenture obligations.\nDepartment of Energy-Guaranteed Loans. We have loans from the Federal Financing Bank guaranteed by the Department of Energy to provide funding for over $4.6 billion of the cost to construct our 30% undivided share of Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4. At December 31, 2020, aggregate Department of Energy-guaranteed borrowings totaled $3.6 billion, including capitalized interest. All of the debt advanced under the loan guarantee agreement is secured ratably with all other debt under our first mortgage indenture. For additional information regarding these loans, see Note 7a of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCombined, this $4.6 billion and the $2.3 billion of debt we have raised in the capital markets represent long-term financing for more than 92% of our $7.5 billion project budget. We expect to raise long-term financing for the remaining amounts in the capital markets.\nIn accordance with the related promissory notes, we began principal repayments of our Department of Energy-guaranteed loans in February 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had repaid $79.1 million under these loans. If we fully advance these loans, we expect to repay a total of approximately $300 million in principal on these loans by November 2022. We plan to issue first mortgage bonds to refinance the principal repaid before the in-service date of Vogtle Unit No. 4.\nRural Utilities Service-Guaranteed Loans. In July 2020, we advanced the remaining $5.8 million under a $448.3 million Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed loan that was funded through the Federal Financing Bank. We currently have one approved Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed loan totaling $630.3 million to fund general and environmental improvements. We began borrowing from this loan in January 2021. As of December 31, 2020, we had $2.4 billion of debt outstanding under various Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed loans, a decrease of $96.1 million from December 31, 2019.\nAll of the approved Rural Utilities Service-guaranteed loans are funded through the Federal Financing Bank, and the debt is secured ratably with all other debt under our first mortgage indenture.\nBond Financings. As a result of the market conditions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, on April 1, 2020, we purchased for our own account $212.8 million of Series 2013 term-rate pollution control revenue bonds that were issued on our behalf by the Development Authorities of Appling, Burke and Monroe counties which were subject to mandatory tender. We increased our JPMorgan Chase line of credit by $213 million and drew this amount to fund the purchase. We subsequently repaid this line of credit borrowing with commercial paper, and in August 2020, we remarketed these bonds and used the proceeds to repay the outstanding commercial paper that had financed the purchase of these bonds. In August 2020, we also issued $450 million of taxable first mortgage bonds to repay commercial paper issued to fund a portion of the cost of constructing Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4.\nCapital Requirements\nCash Requirements. Our cash requirements relate primarily to operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service. As discussed under \"Sources of Capital and Liquidity,\" we fund our cash requirements through a mix of funds generated from operations and short- and long-term borrowings. For additional information regarding our contractual commitments, see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital Expenditures. As part of our ongoing capital planning, we forecast expenditures required for generating facilities and other capital projects. The table below details these forecasts for 2021 through 2023. Actual expenditures may vary from the estimates listed in the table because of factors such as changes in business conditions, design changes and\nrework required by regulatory bodies, delays in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, construction delays, changing environmental requirements, and changes in cost of capital, equipment, material and labor.\n\n(1)Includes allowance for funds used during construction.\n(2)Relates to construction of Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4, excluding initial nuclear fuel core. Forecasted expenditures are based on assumed in-service dates of November 2020 for Vogtle Unit No. 3 and November 2021 for Vogtle Unit No. 4.\n(3)Normal additions and replacements to plant in-service.\n(4)Pollution control equipment and facilities being installed at coal-fired Plant Scherer, including to comply with coal ash regulations.\n(5)Includes nuclear fuel on existing nuclear units and initial nuclear fuel core for Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4.\nFor information regarding the Vogtle project, see \"BUSINESS - OUR POWER SUPPLY RESOURCES - Future Power Resources - Plant Vogtle Units No. 3 and No. 4\" and \"- Financing Activities.\"\nWe are currently subject to extensive environmental regulations and may be subject to future additional environmental regulations, including future implementation of existing laws and regulations. Since alternative legislative and regulatory environmental compliance programs continue to be debated on a state and national level, we cannot predict what capital costs may ultimately be required. Therefore, environmental expenditures included in the above table only include amounts related to budgeted projects to comply with existing and certain well-defined rules and regulations and do not include amounts related to compliance with other, less certain rules.\nDepending on how we and the other co-owners of Plants Scherer and Wansley choose to comply with any future legislation or regulations, both capital expenditures and operating expenditures may be impacted. As required by the wholesale power contracts, we expect to be able to recover from our members all capital and operating expenditures made in complying with current and future environmental regulations.\nFor additional information regarding environmental regulation, see \"BUSINESS - REGULATION - Environmental.\"\nCredit Rating Risk\nThe table below sets forth our current ratings from S&P Global Ratings, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.\n\n(1)We currently have no long-term debt that is unsecured, however, pricing of our $1.2 billion syndicated line of credit is determined based on our unsecured or issuer ratings.\nWe have financial and other contractual agreements in place containing provisions which, upon a credit rating downgrade below specified levels, may require the posting of collateral in the form of letters of credit or other acceptable\ncollateral. Our primary exposure to potential collateral postings is at rating levels of BBB-/Baa3 or below. As of December 31, 2020, our maximum potential collateral requirements were as follows:\nAt senior secured rating levels:\n\u2022approximately $52 million at a senior secured level of BBB-/Baa3,\n\u2022approximately $93 million at a senior secured level of BB+/Ba1 or below, and\nAt senior unsecured or issuer rating levels:\n\u2022approximately $5.4 million at a senior unsecured or issuer level of BBB-/Baa3,\n\u2022approximately $62 million at a senior unsecured or issuer rating level of BB+/Ba1 or below.\nThe Rural Utilities Service Loan Contract contains covenants that, upon a credit rating downgrade below investment grade by two rating agencies, could result in restrictions on issuing debt. Certain of credit agreements and pollution control bond agreements contain provisions based on our ratings that, upon a credit rating downgrade below specified levels, could result in increased interest rates. Also, borrowing rates, letter of credit fees and commitment fees in two of our lines of credit agreements are based on credit ratings and could increase if our ratings are lowered. None of these covenants and provisions, however, would result in acceleration of any debt due to credit rating downgrades.\nGiven our current level of ratings, our management does not have any reason to expect a downgrade that would result in any material impacts to our business. However, our ratings reflect only the views of the rating agencies and we cannot give any assurance that our ratings will be maintained at current levels for any period of time.", "item_7_tables":
