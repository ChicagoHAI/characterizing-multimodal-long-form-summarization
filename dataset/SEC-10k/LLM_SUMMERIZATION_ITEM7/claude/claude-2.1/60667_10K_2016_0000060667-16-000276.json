Unless otherwise noted, all references herein for the years 2015, 2014 and 2013 represent the fiscal years ended January 29, 2016, January 30, 2015 and January 31, 2014, respectively. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Comparable sales increased 4.8%, driven by a comparable average ticket increase of 2.5% and a comparable transaction increase of 2.2%. Net earnings, which were negatively impacted by an impairment charge discussed below, declined 5.6% to $2.5 billion. Diluted earnings per common share increased to $2.73 from $2.71 in 2014.\nResults for 2015 were negatively impacted by a $530 million non-cash impairment charge associated with our decision to exit the Australian home improvement market by withdrawing from our joint venture with Woolworths Limited. Excluding the impact of this charge, adjusted net income totaled $3.1 billion, an increase of 14.0% over 2014, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 21.4% to $3.29 (see discussion on non-GAAP financial measures beginning on page 21).\nFor 2015, cash flows from operating activities were approximately $4.8 billion, with $1.2 billion used for capital expenditures. Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, the company repurchased 53.5 million shares of stock through the share repurchase program for $3.8 billion and paid $957 million in dividends during the year.\nThroughout 2015, we remained committed to our key priorities, capitalizing on opportunities within an improving economy and further pursue top line growth through differentiating ourselves with better customer experiences, improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer, and driving productivity and profitability. In addition, we continued to enhance our omni-channel capabilities, providing not just the products, but also the services, information, and advice to help our customers at every step of the home improvement journey and build a greater affinity for the Lowe's brand.\nThrough collaboration between our merchants, stores, and customer experience design team, we leveraged our customer experience design capabilities as well as our larger store format to showcase the Outdoor Living Experience and the Holiday D\u00e9cor Experience which drove strong sales and attachment for products during the year. To help customers envision and create their outdoor spaces for spring, we displayed patio sets with coordinating rugs, umbrellas, and accessories, along with grills and other outdoor products just as they would have expected in their own backyard. This space was re-purposed for the Holiday D\u00e9cor Experience in the second half of the year which inspired customers to decorate, raised awareness of the breadth of holiday d\u00e9cor and gift offerings, and provided project solutions relevant to the holiday micro seasons. By providing an integrative and cohesive assortment of products, inspiring and intuitive presentation and display, and optimal service components across all selling channels, we are able to provide better customer experiences that differentiate us in the marketplace.\nWe remained committed to building on our strong foundation with the Pro customer by continuing to advance our product and service offerings to meet their unique needs. Throughout the year, we have strengthened our portfolio of Pro-focused brands with the addition of both national and local brands. In addition, our re-launch of LowesForPros.com in the first half of the year provides the Pro customer with an easy online ordering experience with their choice of in-store pick-up or delivery, saving the Pro time and money. The site makes it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and easily purchase items for their locations\nnationwide. We are also reconnecting with Pro customers through targeted marketing, as well as Pro-focused events to drive awareness and generate new business.\nIn an effort to drive expense productivity during 2015, we effectively managed payroll hours on solid comparable sales growth and improved productivity in advertising through targeted spend. We increased the efficiency and effectiveness of our marketing spend through optimized media allocation, presence in targeted digital advertising, expanded social media presence, and reduced print advertising, all while maintaining our customer reach and improving exposure. In addition to payroll and marketing expenses, we remain committed to identifying and implementing additional expense efficiencies by leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend, which improves the flow through of sales dollars to operating profit.\nWe also continued to enhance our omni-channel capabilities in 2015. Online, we have enhanced our customer experience and presentation through Lowes.com, including improved product search, integrated and upgraded product videos, enhanced product presentation, and simplified product groupings to make it easy for customers to make their selections. Our in-home selling networks, including both interior and exterior project specialists, continued to expand with exterior specialists available across all US stores and interior specialists expected in all stores by the end of fiscal year 2016.\nLooking Forward\nEconomic forecasts for 2016 suggest the outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive. Continued support from steady job growth and improved household incomes, as well as favorable trends in the housing market, should keep home improvement growth buoyant. Despite recent volatility in the financial markets, the fundamentals for continued growth in consumer spending remain intact. Consumers should continue to benefit from improved household financial conditions and lower gas prices on top of moderate job and income growth.\nAs we move into 2016, we continue to take a prudent approach to managing our portfolio of businesses, making decisions that will shape how we better serve and connect with customers. With the decision to exit the Australian home improvement market during the fourth quarter of 2015, we will focus our resources on areas of the business where we see greater potential return on investment. In early 2016, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire RONA inc. (RONA), a major Canadian retailer and distributor of hardware, building materials, and home renovation products. This transaction is expected to accelerate Lowe's growth strategy by significantly expanding our presence in the Canadian market through the addition of RONA's attractive business and store locations. The transaction is subject to RONA common shareholder approval and receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the second half of 2016.\nAt the same time we are reinforcing our international business, we will remain focused on growing sales by continuing to differentiate ourselves through better customer experiences that make us the project authority, improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer, and enhancing our omni-channel capabilities to support customers at every step of their home improvement journey. We will also focus on driving productivity and profitability through payroll and marketing optimization and leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend. This strategic framework along with our efforts to improve productivity and profitability give us confidence in our Business Outlook for 2016.\nOPERATIONS\nThe following tables set forth the percentage relationship to net sales of each line item of the consolidated statements of earnings, as well as the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year.

The adoption of these accounting standards required reclassification of current deferred tax assets and liabilities to non-current, as well as reclassification of debt issuance costs from other assets to long-term debt, excluding current maturities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nReturn on Invested Capital\nWe believe Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is a meaningful metric for investors because it measures how effectively the Company uses capital to generate profits.\nWe define ROIC as trailing four quarters' net operating profit after tax divided by the average of ending debt and equity for the last five quarters. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly, the method used by our management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC. We encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its ROIC before comparing its ROIC to ours.\nWe consider return on average debt and equity to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to ROIC. The difference between these two measures is that ROIC adjusts net earnings to exclude tax adjusted interest expense.\nThe calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation to the calculation of return on average debt and equity, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calculation of Return on Invested Capital\n(In millions, except percentage data)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Numerator\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - net\n</td> <td>552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>1,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before interest and taxes\n</td> <td>4,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax adjustment 1\n</td> <td>2,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating profit after tax\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>42.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Denominator\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average debt and equity 2, 3\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on invested capital 4\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calculation of Return on Average Debt and Equity\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Numerator\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Denominator\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average debt and equity 2, 3\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average debt and equity\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>Income tax adjustment is defined as earnings before interest and taxes multiplied by the effective tax rate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2\n</td> <td>Average debt and equity is defined as average debt, including current maturities and short-term borrowings, plus total equity for the last five quarters.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3\n</td> <td>Fiscal years 2014 and 2013 have been adjusted as a result of the Company's retrospective adoption of ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful insight for investors in evaluating what management considers the Company's core financial performance. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nAdjusted net earnings, adjusted EBIT, and adjusted diluted earnings per share should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net earnings and diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company's methods of determining these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the methods used by other companies for these or similar non-GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the measures used by other companies.\nThe most comparable GAAP measures are net earnings and diluted earnings per share. The following provides a reconciliation of adjusted net earnings, adjusted EBIT, and adjusted diluted earnings per share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures:\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calculation of Adjusted Net Earnings, Adjusted EBIT, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except per share and percentage data)\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Sales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash impairment charge\n</td> <td>530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest - net\n</td> <td>552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision\n</td> <td>1,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBIT\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per common share, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash impairment charge\n</td> <td>0.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted diluted earnings per common share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014\nNet sales - Net sales increased 5.1% to $59.1 billion in 2015. The increase in total sales was driven primarily by the comparable sales increase of 4.8% and new stores. The comparable sales increase of 4.8% in 2015 was driven by a 2.5% increase in comparable average ticket and a 2.2% increase in comparable customer transactions. Comparable sales during each quarter of the fiscal year, as reported, were 5.2% in the first quarter, 4.3% in the second quarter, 4.6% in the third quarter, and 5.2% in the fourth quarter.\nAll of our product categories experienced comparable sales increases for the year. During 2015, comparable sales were above the company average in the following product categories: Appliances, Outdoor Power Equipment, and Seasonal Living. Appliances experienced the strongest growth with a double digit increase in comparable sales as we further strengthened our brand offerings and breadth of assortment and continued to provide service advantages with next-day delivery and haul away. Within Outdoor Power Equipment, we drove strong performance in walk behind and riding mowers as well as pressure washers. The Outdoor Living Experience introduced last year drove comparable sales in our Seasonal Living category, where we continued to see strong sales in patio furniture, replacement cushions, and outdoor accessories. In addition, Tools & Hardware performed at approximately the overall company average driven by strong demand and continued improvement in both product assortment and brand relevance. Geographically, all of our 14 U.S. regions experienced increases in comparable store sales, as sales performance was well balanced across the country.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded comparable sales increases above the company average in Lumber & Building Materials, Appliances, Lawn & Garden, and Paint. We saw particular strength in outdoor project categories, led by Lumber & Building Materials and Lawn & Garden, as customers took advantage of mild weather to complete exterior projects such as roofs, fences, decks, and lawn care. Our landscape lighting experience also drove strong performance by providing inspiration and easy selection and installation for customers, while offering new product technologies such as LED. We achieved strong comparable sales increases in Appliances during the quarter through strengthened brand offerings and service advantages. Paint benefited from increased project activity, as well as growing awareness of our three-brand offering, providing customers with a full suite of top brands they can trust for their next paint project.\nGross margin - Gross margin of 34.82% for 2015 represented a three basis point increase from 2014 and was primarily driven by cost reductions associated with value improvement and product cost deflation, partially offset by negative impacts from targeted promotional activity and mix of products sold.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, gross margin of 34.66% was flat as a percentage of sales due to the same factors that impacted gross margin in the year.\nSG&A - SG&A expense for 2015 deleveraged 28 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to 2014. This was primarily driven by 90 basis points of deleverage associated with an impairment charge recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the valuation of our one-third interest in the Australian joint venture with Woolworths Limited. This was partially offset by 16 basis points of leverage associated with operating salaries as we optimized payroll hours against customer traffic and 16\nbasis points of leverage in advertising expense due to more efficient and effective media mix compared to the prior year. We experienced eight basis points of leverage in employee insurance costs due to increased sales in the current year partially offset by additional costs associated with the Affordable Care Act. We also experienced eight basis points of leverage in utilities due to stronger sales as well as a decrease in rates and consumption. In addition, we experienced seven basis points of leverage in building and site repair due to a decrease in the number of repairs during the year and seven basis points of leverage in external labor due to completed projects and increased focus on use of internal resources across information technology projects.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, SG&A expense deleveraged 332 basis points as a percentage of sales due primarily to 401 basis points of deleverage associated with the Australian joint venture impairment charge partially offset by leverage in operating salaries, advertising expense, utilities, employee insurance, and certain other fixed costs. We experienced 25 basis points of leverage in operating salaries associated with optimization of store payroll hours and 20 basis points in advertising expense due to more efficient and effective media mix. We also experienced 12 basis points of leverage in utilities primarily the result of warmer weather and 12 basis points in employee insurance costs due to a reduction in the number and severity of claims. Certain other fixed costs also leveraged as a result of sales growth.\nDepreciation - Depreciation expense leveraged 13 basis points for 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the increase in sales. Property, less accumulated depreciation, decreased to $19.6 billion at January 29, 2016 compared to $20.0 billion at January 30, 2015. At January 29, 2016 and January 30, 2015, we owned 86% of our stores, which included stores on leased land.\nInterest - Net - Net interest expense is comprised of the following:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net of amount capitalized\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>515\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of original issue discount and loan costs\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest - net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of $1.75 billion and $1.25 billion of unsecured notes in September 2015 and 2014, respectively. This was partially offset by the repayment of $500 million unsecured notes on October 15, 2015.\nIncome tax provision - Our effective income tax rate was 42.4% in 2015 compared to 36.9% in 2014. During 2015, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset related to losses associated with the joint venture investment in Australia with Woolworths Limited. The deferred tax asset associated with these losses was offset with the establishment of a full valuation allowance due to the fact the benefit of these losses can only be realized to the extent the Company has available capital gains for offset, and no present or future capital gains have been identified through which this deferred tax asset can be realized. Excluding the equity losses and related deferred tax asset would have resulted in an effective income tax rate of 38.2%. The effective tax rate in 2014 benefited from the favorable settlement of certain federal tax matters.\nFiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013\nNet sales - Net sales increased 5.3% to $56.2 billion in 2014. The increase in total sales was driven primarily by the comparable sales increase of 4.3%, the acquisition of Orchard, and new stores. The comparable sales increase of 4.3% in 2014 was driven by a 2.4% increase in comparable average ticket and a 1.8% increase in comparable customer transactions. Comparable sales increased during each quarter of the fiscal year as we reported 0.9% in the first quarter, 4.4% in the second quarter, 5.1% in the third quarter, and 7.3% in the fourth quarter.\nAll of our product categories experienced comparable sales increases for the year. During 2014, we experienced comparable sales above the company average in the following product categories: Appliances, Millwork, Tools & Hardware, Fashion Fixtures, and Outdoor Power Equipment. Targeted promotions coupled with the expansion of our Project Specialist programs drove comparable sales increases, especially within Appliances, Millwork, and Fashion Fixtures, as we continued to benefit from customers' increasing interest in refreshing both the interior and exterior of their homes. Within Tools & Hardware, our enhanced Sales & Operations Planning process helped us drive strong performance in power and pneumatic tools. We drove comparable sales within Outdoor Power Equipment as we were prepared to meet strong demand for mowers, trimmers, and snow blowers. In addition, Flooring performed at approximately the overall company average. Geographically, 13 of the 14 U.S. regions experienced increases in comparable store sales, as sales performance was well balanced across the country.\nGross margin - Gross margin of 34.79% for 2014 represented a 20 basis point increase from 2013 and was primarily driven by cost reductions associated with our Value Improvement initiative, which consisted of improved line review and product reset processes to better position us to meet customers' product needs and drive better inventory productivity.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, gross margin decreased one basis point as a percentage of sales. Gross margin was negatively impacted by mix of products sold and price actions on specific categories, partially offset by our Value Improvement program and better seasonal sell-through.\nSG&A - SG&A expense for 2014 leveraged 46 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to 2013. This was primarily driven by 21 basis points of leverage associated with operating salaries as we optimized payroll hours against customer traffic. We also experienced 16 basis points of leverage associated with incentive compensation due to lower attainment levels compared to the prior year and seven basis points of leverage in property taxes due to favorability in property valuations recognized in the current year. In addition, we experienced six basis points of leverage in advertising expense due to increased sales and five basis points of leverage in utilities due to decreased consumption due to favorable weather experienced in the current year. These were partially offset by 23 basis points of deleverage in employee insurance costs, due to increased claims as well as additional costs associated with the Affordable Care Act.\nSG&A expense during the fourth quarter leveraged 88 basis points due primarily to long-lived asset impairments recorded in the prior year, as well as leverage in operating salaries, and property taxes.\nDepreciation - Depreciation expense leveraged 10 basis points for 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the increase in sales. Property, less accumulated depreciation, decreased to $20.0 billion at January 30, 2015 compared to $20.8 billion at January 31, 2014. At January 30, 2015 and January 31, 2014, we owned 86% of our stores, which included stores on leased land.\nInterest - Net - Net interest expense is comprised of the following:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net of amount capitalized\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>474\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of original issue discount and loan costs\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest - net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of $1.25 billion and $1.0 billion of unsecured notes in September 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nIncome tax provision - Our effective income tax rate was 36.9% in 2014 compared to 37.8% in 2013. The lower effective tax rate in 2014 was the result of the favorable settlement of certain federal tax matters during the year.\nLOWE'S BUSINESS OUTLOOK\nFiscal year 2016 will consist of 53 weeks, whereas fiscal year 2015 consisted of 52 weeks. As of February 24, 2016, the date of our fourth quarter 2015 earnings release, we expected total sales in 2016 to increase approximately 6%, including the 53rd week. The 53rd week is expected to increase total sales by approximately 1.5%. We expected comparable sales to increase approximately 4%. We expected to open approximately 45 home improvement and hardware stores during 2016. In addition, earnings before interest and taxes as a percentage of sales (operating margin) were expected to increase 80 to 90 basis points,1 and the effective tax rate was expected to be approximately 38.1%. Diluted earnings per share of approximately $4.00 were expected for the fiscal year ending February 3, 2017. Our guidance assumed approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchases during 2016.\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>Operating margin growth excludes the impact of the non-cash impairment charge on the Australian joint venture. The non-cash impairment charge negatively impacted operating margin by approximately 90 basis points in fiscal year 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activities for each of the three most recent fiscal years ended January 29, 2016:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>4,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(1,343\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,088\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,286\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(3,493\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,761\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,969\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows from operating activities continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 versus 2014 was primarily driven by changes in working capital. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 versus 2013 was primarily driven by increased net earnings, as well as changes in working capital.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities for 2015 versus 2014 was primarily driven by increased capital expenditures and purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities, partially offset by decreased contributions to equity method investments. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities for 2014 versus 2013 was primarily driven by the acquisition of Orchard in 2013 and decreased capital expenditures, partially offset by increased contributions to equity method investments in 2014.\nThe decrease in net cash used in financing activities for 2015 versus 2014 was driven primarily by increased proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and net repayments of short-term borrowings in the prior year versus net borrowings in the current year. This was partially offset by increased repayments of long-term debt and increased cash dividend payments in the current year. The increase in net cash used in financing activities for 2014 versus 2013 was driven primarily by 2014 repayments of 2013 short-term borrowings.\nSources of Liquidity\nIn addition to our cash flows from operations, liquidity is provided by our short-term borrowing facilities. We have a $1.75 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement (the 2014 Credit Facility) with a syndicate of banks that expires in August 2019. Subject to obtaining commitments from the lenders and satisfying other conditions specified in the 2014 Credit Facility, we may increase the aggregate availability by an additional $500 million. The 2014 Credit Facility supports our commercial paper program and has a $500 million letter of credit sublimit. Letters of credit issued pursuant to the facility reduce the amount available for borrowing under its terms. Borrowings made are unsecured and are priced at fixed rates based upon market conditions at the time of funding in accordance with the terms of the facility. The 2014 Credit Facility contains certain restrictive covenants, which include maintenance of an adjusted debt leverage ratio as defined by the credit agreement. We were in compliance with those covenants at January 29, 2016. As of January 29, 2016, there were $43 million of outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program and no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under the credit facility.\nWe expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both short-term and long-term bases when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new long-term debt. The availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected, however, by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios. The table below reflects our debt ratings by Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Moody's as of March 28, 2016, which we are disclosing to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds. Although we currently do not expect a downgrade in our debt ratings, our commercial paper and senior debt ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Ratings\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Paper\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Debt\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outlook\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that net cash provided by operating and financing activities will be adequate not only for our operating requirements, but also for investments in our existing stores, investments in information technology, expansion plans,\nacquisitions, if any, and to return cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases over the next 12 months. There are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price. In addition, we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held in foreign affiliates to fund domestic operations. Unrepatriated cash was not significant for all periods presented.\nCash Requirements\nCapital expenditures\nOur fiscal 2016 capital forecast is approximately $1.5 billion. Our expansion plans are expected to account for approximately 45% of planned net cash outflow. Investments in our existing stores, including investments in remerchandising, store equipment, and technology, are expected to account for approximately 30% of net cash outflow. Approximately 20% of planned net cash outflow is for corporate programs, including investments to enhance the customer experience, as well as enhancements to the corporate infrastructure. Other planned capital expenditures, accounting for approximately 5% of planned net cash outflow, are for investments in our existing distribution network.\nOn February 2, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of RONA for C$24 per share in cash and preferred shares for C$20 per share in cash, for a total transaction price of approximately C$3.2 billion. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of Lowe's and RONA and is supported by the management teams of both companies; however, the transaction is subject to both shareholder and regulatory approvals. We anticipate financing the transaction through the debt capital markets. In addition, we have entered into an option to purchase Canadian dollars at a strike price of 1.3933 expiring November 1, 2016. The transaction is expected to close in fiscal year 2016.\nDebt and capital\nUnsecured debt of $475 million and $550 million is scheduled to mature in April and October 2016, respectively. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding long-term debt, including fiscal year 2015 financing activities.\nWe have an ongoing share repurchase program, authorized by the Company's Board of Directors, that is executed through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private off-market transactions. Shares purchased under the repurchase program are retired and returned to authorized and unissued status. As of January 29, 2016, we had $3.6 billion remaining available under our share repurchase program with no expiration date. In fiscal 2016, we expect to repurchase shares totaling $3.5 billion through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private off market transactions in accordance with SEC regulations. Our share repurchase assumption is not expected to be affected by the RONA acquisition. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding share repurchases.\nDividends declared during fiscal 2015 totaled $991 million. Our dividend payment dates are established such that dividends are paid in the quarter immediately following the quarter in which they are declared. The dividend declared in the fourth quarter of 2015 was paid in fiscal 2016 and totaled $255 million.\nOur ratio of debt to equity plus debt was 62.3% and 53.3% as of January 29, 2016, and January 30, 2015, respectively.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nOther than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at January 29, 2016:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations (in millions)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (principal amounts, excluding discount and debt issuance costs)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (interest payments)\n</td> <td>8,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized lease obligations 1, 2\n</td> <td>991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases 1\n</td> <td>5,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations 3\n</td> <td>1,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Commitments (in millions)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of Credit 4\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>Amounts do not include taxes, common area maintenance, insurance, or contingent rent because these amounts have historically been insignificant.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2\n</td> <td>Amounts include imputed interest and residual values.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3\n</td> <td>Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding, and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.

We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\nMerchandise Inventory\nDescription\nWe record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost. This reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience. During 2015, our reserve decreased approximately $6 million to $46 million as of January 29, 2016.\nWe also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories. This reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage results from previous physical inventories. During 2015, the inventory shrinkage reserve increased approximately $9 million to $171 million as of January 29, 2016.\nIn addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, sales, early payments or promotions of vendors' products. Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor's product. Therefore, we treat these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory as the amounts are accrued, and recognize these funds as a reduction of cost of sales when the\ninventory is sold. Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related expense.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nWe do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions. However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves. Likewise, changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories. We also apply judgment in the determination of levels of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value.\nFor vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place. Due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded. Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years. We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves. However, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves. A 10% change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $2 million for 2015. A 10% change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrinkage reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $10 million for 2015.\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory. However, substantially all receivables associated with these activities do not require subjective long-term estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year. Adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material.\nEquity Method Investments\nDescription\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. Our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. Each of the Company's equity method investments is subject to a review for impairment if, and when, circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment could be less than the carrying value. If the results of our review indicate an other than temporary decline in the carrying value of our investment, the Company would write down the investment to its estimated fair value.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nOur impairment evaluations for equity method investments require us to apply judgment in determining whether a decrease in value that is other than temporary has occurred. If we need to assess the recoverability of our equity method investments, we will make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows of those investments. These calculations require us to apply judgments, including assumptions of future performance, based on business plans and forecasts, recent economic and business trends, and competitive conditions.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we made the decision to exit our Australian joint venture investment with Woolworths Limited (Woolworths) and recorded a $530 million impairment of our investment due to a determination that there was a decrease in value that was other than temporary. We own a one-third share in the joint venture, Hydrox Holdings Pty Ltd., which operates Masters Home Improvement stores and Home Timber and Hardware Group's retail stores and wholesale distribution in Australia. As a result of our decision to exit, Woolworths will be required to purchase Lowe's one-third share in the joint venture at an agreed upon fair value as of January 18, 2016, the date of our notification of our intention to exit. The process for the two parties agreeing on fair value is prescribed in the Joint Venture Agreement. Finalization of the purchase price for Lowe's interest in the joint venture and completion of the sale is expected to occur in 2016. The $530 million non-cash impairment charge, which includes the cumulative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar over the life of the investment,\nwas based on the Company's estimate of the value of its portion of the overall joint venture fair value. This value was determined using an income approach based on expected discounted cash flows, and was validated for reasonableness by comparison to similar transaction multiples. The assumptions that most significantly affect the fair value determination include the continuation as a going concern, projected revenues, projected margin rates and the discount rate. Further changes in this estimate are possible as the parties proceed through the final stages of the valuation process as defined in the Joint Venture Agreement. A 10% change in our current estimate of fair value of the joint venture would have affected net earnings by approximately $39 million for 2015.\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment\nDescription\nWe review the carrying amounts of locations whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. When evaluating locations for impairment, our asset group is at an individual location level, as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable. Cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead.\nWe evaluate locations for triggering events relating to long-lived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location's asset carrying values may not be recoverable. For operating locations, our primary indicator that asset carrying values may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a 12-month period for those locations that have been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results. Management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment, including individual locations' execution of their operating plans and local market conditions, including incursion, which is the opening of either other Lowe's locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market. We also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\nA potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location's assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets. When determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location, management makes assumptions, incorporating local market conditions, about key store variables including sales growth rates, gross margin and controllable expenses, such as store payroll and occupancy expense, as well as asset residual values or lease rates. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.\nWe use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations, which requires discounting projected future cash flows. This involves making assumptions regarding both a location's future cash flows, as described above, and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows. We discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows. The selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nOur impairment evaluations for long-lived assets require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred, including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows, including estimated sales, margin, and controllable expenses, assumptions about market performance for operating locations, and estimated selling prices or lease rates for locations identified for closure. We also apply judgment in estimating asset fair values, including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair values determined using an income approach.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nDuring 2015, two operating locations experienced a triggering event, and both locations were determined to be impaired. We recorded impairment losses related to these two operating locations of $8 million during 2015, compared to impairment losses of $26 million related to three operating locations impaired during 2014.\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flows of operating locations or locations identified for closure during the past three fiscal years. If the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its useful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values, our actual impairment losses could vary positively or negatively from our estimated impairment losses.\nSelf-Insurance\nDescription\nWe are self-insured for certain losses relating to workers' compensation, automobile, general and product liability, extended protection plan, and certain medical and dental claims. Our self-insured retention or deductible, as applicable, is limited to $2 million per occurrence involving workers' compensation, $5 million per occurrence involving general or product liability, and $10 million per occurrence involving automobile. We do not have any insurance coverage for self-insured extended protection plan or medical and dental claims. Self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for self-insured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience. During 2015, our self-insurance liability decreased approximately $22 million to $883 million as of January 29, 2016.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nThese estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment, utilized discount rate, projected exposures including payroll, sales and vehicle units, as well as the frequency, lag and severity of claims.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our self-insurance liability during the past three fiscal years. Although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded self-insurance liabilities. A 10% change in our self-insurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately $54 million for 2015. A 100 basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately $18 million for 2015.\nRevenue Recognition\nDescription\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies. The following accounting estimates relating to revenue recognition require management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the effects of future events that cannot be determined with certainty.\nWe sell separately-priced extended protection plan contracts under a Lowe's-branded program for which the Company is ultimately self-insured. The Company recognizes revenues from extended protection plan sales on a straight-line basis over the respective contract term. Extended protection plan contract terms primarily range from one to four years from the date of purchase or the end of the manufacturer's warranty, as applicable. The Company consistently groups and evaluates extended protection plan contracts based on the characteristics of the underlying products and the coverage provided in order to monitor for expected losses. A loss on the overall contract would be recognized if the expected costs of performing services under the contracts exceeded the amount of unamortized acquisition costs and related deferred revenue associated with the contracts. Deferred revenues associated with the extended protection plan contracts decreased $1 million to $729 million as of January 29, 2016.\nWe defer revenue and cost of sales associated with settled transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed. Revenue is deferred based on the actual amounts received. We use historical gross margin rates to estimate the adjustment to cost of sales for these transactions. During 2015, deferred revenues associated with these transactions increased $74 million to $619 million as of January 29, 2016.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nFor extended protection plans, there is judgment inherent in our evaluation of expected losses as a result of our methodology for grouping and evaluating extended protection plan contracts and from the actuarial determination of the estimated cost of the contracts. There is also judgment inherent in our determination of the recognition pattern of costs of performing services under these contracts.\nFor the deferral of revenue and cost of sales associated with transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed, there is judgment inherent in our estimates of gross margin rates.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize revenue on our extended protection plan contracts during the past three fiscal years. We currently do not anticipate incurring any overall contract losses on our extended protection plan contracts. Although we believe that we have the ability to adequately monitor and estimate expected losses\nunder the extended protection plan contracts, it is possible that actual results could differ from our estimates. In addition, if future evidence indicates that the costs of performing services under these contracts are incurred on other than a straight-line basis, the timing of revenue recognition under these contracts could change. A 10% change in the amount of revenue recognized in 2015 under these contracts would have affected net earnings by approximately $22 million.\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to reverse net sales and cost of sales related to amounts received for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed. We believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates related to the impact to cost of sales for these transactions. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may incur additional income or expense. A 10% change in the estimate of the gross margin rates applied to these transactions would have affected net earnings by approximately $10 million in 2015.\nDISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nWe speak throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K in forward-looking statements about our future, but particularly in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d.

Unless otherwise noted, all references herein for the years 2015, 2014 and 2013 represent the fiscal years ended January 29, 2016, January 30, 2015 and January 31, 2014, respectively. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. This discussion and analysis is presented in seven sections:\n \u2022 Executive Overview \n \u2022 Operations \n \u2022 Lowe's Business Outlook \n \u2022 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources \n \u2022 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n \u2022 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nNet sales for 2015 were $59.1 billion, a 5.1% increase over fiscal year 2014. Comparable sales increased 4.8%, driven by a comparable average ticket increase of 2.5% and a comparable transaction increase of 2.2%. Net earnings, which were negatively impacted by an impairment charge discussed below, declined 5.6% to $2.5 billion. Diluted earnings per common share increased to $2.73 from $2.71 in 2014.\nResults for 2015 were negatively impacted by a $530 million non-cash impairment charge associated with our decision to exit the Australian home improvement market by withdrawing from our joint venture with Woolworths Limited. Excluding the impact of this charge, adjusted net income totaled $3.1 billion, an increase of 14.0% over 2014, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 21.4% to $3.29 (see discussion on non-GAAP financial measures beginning on page 21).\nFor 2015, cash flows from operating activities were approximately $4.8 billion, with $1.2 billion used for capital expenditures. Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, the company repurchased 53.5 million shares of stock through the share repurchase program for $3.8 billion and paid $957 million in dividends during the year.\nThroughout 2015, we remained committed to our key priorities, capitalizing on opportunities within an improving economy and further pursue top line growth through differentiating ourselves with better customer experiences, improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer, and driving productivity and profitability. In addition, we continued to enhance our omni-channel capabilities, providing not just the products, but also the services, information, and advice to help our customers at every step of the home improvement journey and build a greater affinity for the Lowe's brand.\nThrough collaboration between our merchants, stores, and customer experience design team, we leveraged our customer experience design capabilities as well as our larger store format to showcase the Outdoor Living Experience and the Holiday D\u00e9cor Experience which drove strong sales and attachment for products during the year. To help customers envision and create their outdoor spaces for spring, we displayed patio sets with coordinating rugs, umbrellas, and accessories, along with grills and other outdoor products just as they would have expected in their own backyard. This space was re-purposed for the Holiday D\u00e9cor Experience in the second half of the year which inspired customers to decorate, raised awareness of the breadth of holiday d\u00e9cor and gift offerings, and provided project solutions relevant to the holiday micro seasons. By providing an integrative and cohesive assortment of products, inspiring and intuitive presentation and display, and optimal service components across all selling channels, we are able to provide better customer experiences that differentiate us in the marketplace.\nWe remained committed to building on our strong foundation with the Pro customer by continuing to advance our product and service offerings to meet their unique needs. Throughout the year, we have strengthened our portfolio of Pro-focused brands with the addition of both national and local brands. In addition, our re-launch of LowesForPros.com in the first half of the year provides the Pro customer with an easy online ordering experience with their choice of in-store pick-up or delivery, saving the Pro time and money. The site makes it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and easily purchase items for their locations\nnationwide. We are also reconnecting with Pro customers through targeted marketing, as well as Pro-focused events to drive awareness and generate new business.\nIn an effort to drive expense productivity during 2015, we effectively managed payroll hours on solid comparable sales growth and improved productivity in advertising through targeted spend. We increased the efficiency and effectiveness of our marketing spend through optimized media allocation, presence in targeted digital advertising, expanded social media presence, and reduced print advertising, all while maintaining our customer reach and improving exposure. In addition to payroll and marketing expenses, we remain committed to identifying and implementing additional expense efficiencies by leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend, which improves the flow through of sales dollars to operating profit.\nWe also continued to enhance our omni-channel capabilities in 2015. Online, we have enhanced our customer experience and presentation through Lowes.com, including improved product search, integrated and upgraded product videos, enhanced product presentation, and simplified product groupings to make it easy for customers to make their selections. Our in-home selling networks, including both interior and exterior project specialists, continued to expand with exterior specialists available across all US stores and interior specialists expected in all stores by the end of fiscal year 2016.\nLooking Forward\nEconomic forecasts for 2016 suggest the outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive. Continued support from steady job growth and improved household incomes, as well as favorable trends in the housing market, should keep home improvement growth buoyant. Despite recent volatility in the financial markets, the fundamentals for continued growth in consumer spending remain intact. Consumers should continue to benefit from improved household financial conditions and lower gas prices on top of moderate job and income growth.\nAs we move into 2016, we continue to take a prudent approach to managing our portfolio of businesses, making decisions that will shape how we better serve and connect with customers. With the decision to exit the Australian home improvement market during the fourth quarter of 2015, we will focus our resources on areas of the business where we see greater potential return on investment. In early 2016, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire RONA inc. (RONA), a major Canadian retailer and distributor of hardware, building materials, and home renovation products. This transaction is expected to accelerate Lowe's growth strategy by significantly expanding our presence in the Canadian market through the addition of RONA's attractive business and store locations. The transaction is subject to RONA common shareholder approval and receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the second half of 2016.\nAt the same time we are reinforcing our international business, we will remain focused on growing sales by continuing to differentiate ourselves through better customer experiences that make us the project authority, improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer, and enhancing our omni-channel capabilities to support customers at every step of their home improvement journey. We will also focus on driving productivity and profitability through payroll and marketing optimization and leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend. This strategic framework along with our efforts to improve productivity and profitability give us confidence in our Business Outlook for 2016.\nOPERATIONS\nThe following tables set forth the percentage relationship to net sales of each line item of the consolidated statements of earnings, as well as the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year.

EBIT margin for fiscal year 2015 was adjusted to exclude the negative 90 basis points impact of the non-cash impairment charge on the Australian joint venture with Woolworths (Adjusted EBIT margin). Adjusted EBIT is a non-GAAP financial measure. See below for additional information and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure. \n 2 A comparable location is defined as a location that has been open longer than 13 months. A location that is identified for relocation is no longer considered comparable one month prior to its relocation. The relocated location must then remain open longer than 13 months to be considered comparable. A location we have decided to close is no longer considered comparable as of the beginning of the month in which we announce its closing. Acquired locations are included in the comparable sales calculation beginning in the first full month following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. Comparable sales include online sales, which did not have a meaningful impact for the periods presented. \n 3 Average ticket is defined as net sales divided by the total number of customer transactions. \n 4 Average store size selling square feet is defined as sales floor square feet divided by the number of stores open at the end of the period. The average Lowe's home improvement store has approximately 112,000 square feet of retail selling space, while the average Orchard store has approximately 37,000 square feet of retail selling space. \n 5 Return on average assets is defined as net earnings divided by average total assets for the last five quarters. \n 6 Return on average shareholders' equity is defined as net earnings divided by average shareholders' equity for the last five quarters. \n 7 Return on invested capital is a non-GAAP financial measure. See below for additional information and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure. \n 8 Fiscal years 2014 and 2013 have been adjusted as a result of the Company's retrospective adoption of ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, and ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The adoption of these accounting standards required reclassification of current deferred tax assets and liabilities to non-current, as well as reclassification of debt issuance costs from other assets to long-term debt, excluding current maturities. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nReturn on Invested Capital\nWe believe Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is a meaningful metric for investors because it measures how effectively the Company uses capital to generate profits.\nWe define ROIC as trailing four quarters' net operating profit after tax divided by the average of ending debt and equity for the last five quarters. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly, the method used by our management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC. We encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its ROIC before comparing its ROIC to ours.\nWe consider return on average debt and equity to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to ROIC. The difference between these two measures is that ROIC adjusts net earnings to exclude tax adjusted interest expense.\nThe calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation to the calculation of return on average debt and equity, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calculation of Return on Invested Capital\n(In millions, except percentage data)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Numerator\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - net\n</td> <td>552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>1,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before interest and taxes\n</td> <td>4,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax adjustment 1\n</td> <td>2,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating profit after tax\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>42.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Denominator\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average debt and equity 2, 3\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on invested capital 4\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calculation of Return on Average Debt and Equity\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Numerator\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Denominator\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average debt and equity 2, 3\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average debt and equity\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n 1 Income tax adjustment is defined as earnings before interest and taxes multiplied by the effective tax rate. \n 2 Average debt and equity is defined as average debt, including current maturities and short-term borrowings, plus total equity for the last five quarters. \n 3 Fiscal years 2014 and 2013 have been adjusted as a result of the Company's retrospective adoption of ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The adoption of this accounting standard required reclassification of debt issuance costs from other assets to long-term debt, excluding current maturities. \n 4 ROIC for fiscal year 2015 was negatively impacted by approximately 238 basis points due to the non-cash impairment charge on the Australian joint venture with Woolworths. \nAdjusted Net Earnings, Adjusted EBIT, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\nWe have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted net earnings, adjusted EBIT, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which exclude the impact of the $530 million non-cash impairment charge recognized during 2015 in connection with the Company's decision to exit its joint venture with Woolworths Limited in Australia. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful insight for investors in evaluating what management considers the Company's core financial performance. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nAdjusted net earnings, adjusted EBIT, and adjusted diluted earnings per share should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net earnings and diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company's methods of determining these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the methods used by other companies for these or similar non-GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the measures used by other companies.\nThe most comparable GAAP measures are net earnings and diluted earnings per share. The following provides a reconciliation of adjusted net earnings, adjusted EBIT, and adjusted diluted earnings per share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures:\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calculation of Adjusted Net Earnings, Adjusted EBIT, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except per share and percentage data)\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Sales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash impairment charge\n</td> <td>530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest - net\n</td> <td>552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision\n</td> <td>1,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBIT\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per common share, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash impairment charge\n</td> <td>0.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted diluted earnings per common share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014\nNet sales - Net sales increased 5.1% to $59.1 billion in 2015. The increase in total sales was driven primarily by the comparable sales increase of 4.8% and new stores. The comparable sales increase of 4.8% in 2015 was driven by a 2.5% increase in comparable average ticket and a 2.2% increase in comparable customer transactions. Comparable sales during each quarter of the fiscal year, as reported, were 5.2% in the first quarter, 4.3% in the second quarter, 4.6% in the third quarter, and 5.2% in the fourth quarter.\nAll of our product categories experienced comparable sales increases for the year. During 2015, comparable sales were above the company average in the following product categories: Appliances, Outdoor Power Equipment, and Seasonal Living. Appliances experienced the strongest growth with a double digit increase in comparable sales as we further strengthened our brand offerings and breadth of assortment and continued to provide service advantages with next-day delivery and haul away. Within Outdoor Power Equipment, we drove strong performance in walk behind and riding mowers as well as pressure washers. The Outdoor Living Experience introduced last year drove comparable sales in our Seasonal Living category, where we continued to see strong sales in patio furniture, replacement cushions, and outdoor accessories. In addition, Tools & Hardware performed at approximately the overall company average driven by strong demand and continued improvement in both product assortment and brand relevance. Geographically, all of our 14 U.S. regions experienced increases in comparable store sales, as sales performance was well balanced across the country.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded comparable sales increases above the company average in Lumber & Building Materials, Appliances, Lawn & Garden, and Paint. We saw particular strength in outdoor project categories, led by Lumber & Building Materials and Lawn & Garden, as customers took advantage of mild weather to complete exterior projects such as roofs, fences, decks, and lawn care. Our landscape lighting experience also drove strong performance by providing inspiration and easy selection and installation for customers, while offering new product technologies such as LED. We achieved strong comparable sales increases in Appliances during the quarter through strengthened brand offerings and service advantages. Paint benefited from increased project activity, as well as growing awareness of our three-brand offering, providing customers with a full suite of top brands they can trust for their next paint project.\nGross margin - Gross margin of 34.82% for 2015 represented a three basis point increase from 2014 and was primarily driven by cost reductions associated with value improvement and product cost deflation, partially offset by negative impacts from targeted promotional activity and mix of products sold.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, gross margin of 34.66% was flat as a percentage of sales due to the same factors that impacted gross margin in the year.\nSG&A - SG&A expense for 2015 deleveraged 28 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to 2014. This was primarily driven by 90 basis points of deleverage associated with an impairment charge recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the valuation of our one-third interest in the Australian joint venture with Woolworths Limited. This was partially offset by 16 basis points of leverage associated with operating salaries as we optimized payroll hours against customer traffic and 16\nbasis points of leverage in advertising expense due to more efficient and effective media mix compared to the prior year. We experienced eight basis points of leverage in employee insurance costs due to increased sales in the current year partially offset by additional costs associated with the Affordable Care Act. We also experienced eight basis points of leverage in utilities due to stronger sales as well as a decrease in rates and consumption. In addition, we experienced seven basis points of leverage in building and site repair due to a decrease in the number of repairs during the year and seven basis points of leverage in external labor due to completed projects and increased focus on use of internal resources across information technology projects.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, SG&A expense deleveraged 332 basis points as a percentage of sales due primarily to 401 basis points of deleverage associated with the Australian joint venture impairment charge partially offset by leverage in operating salaries, advertising expense, utilities, employee insurance, and certain other fixed costs. We experienced 25 basis points of leverage in operating salaries associated with optimization of store payroll hours and 20 basis points in advertising expense due to more efficient and effective media mix. We also experienced 12 basis points of leverage in utilities primarily the result of warmer weather and 12 basis points in employee insurance costs due to a reduction in the number and severity of claims. Certain other fixed costs also leveraged as a result of sales growth.\nDepreciation - Depreciation expense leveraged 13 basis points for 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the increase in sales. Property, less accumulated depreciation, decreased to $19.6 billion at January 29, 2016 compared to $20.0 billion at January 30, 2015. At January 29, 2016 and January 30, 2015, we owned 86% of our stores, which included stores on leased land.\nInterest - Net - Net interest expense is comprised of the following:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net of amount capitalized\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>515\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of original issue discount and loan costs\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest - net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of $1.75 billion and $1.25 billion of unsecured notes in September 2015 and 2014, respectively. This was partially offset by the repayment of $500 million unsecured notes on October 15, 2015.\nIncome tax provision - Our effective income tax rate was 42.4% in 2015 compared to 36.9% in 2014. During 2015, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset related to losses associated with the joint venture investment in Australia with Woolworths Limited. The deferred tax asset associated with these losses was offset with the establishment of a full valuation allowance due to the fact the benefit of these losses can only be realized to the extent the Company has available capital gains for offset, and no present or future capital gains have been identified through which this deferred tax asset can be realized. Excluding the equity losses and related deferred tax asset would have resulted in an effective income tax rate of 38.2%. The effective tax rate in 2014 benefited from the favorable settlement of certain federal tax matters.\nFiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013\nNet sales - Net sales increased 5.3% to $56.2 billion in 2014. The increase in total sales was driven primarily by the comparable sales increase of 4.3%, the acquisition of Orchard, and new stores. The comparable sales increase of 4.3% in 2014 was driven by a 2.4% increase in comparable average ticket and a 1.8% increase in comparable customer transactions. Comparable sales increased during each quarter of the fiscal year as we reported 0.9% in the first quarter, 4.4% in the second quarter, 5.1% in the third quarter, and 7.3% in the fourth quarter.\nAll of our product categories experienced comparable sales increases for the year. During 2014, we experienced comparable sales above the company average in the following product categories: Appliances, Millwork, Tools & Hardware, Fashion Fixtures, and Outdoor Power Equipment. Targeted promotions coupled with the expansion of our Project Specialist programs drove comparable sales increases, especially within Appliances, Millwork, and Fashion Fixtures, as we continued to benefit from customers' increasing interest in refreshing both the interior and exterior of their homes. Within Tools & Hardware, our enhanced Sales & Operations Planning process helped us drive strong performance in power and pneumatic tools. We drove comparable sales within Outdoor Power Equipment as we were prepared to meet strong demand for mowers, trimmers, and snow blowers. In addition, Flooring performed at approximately the overall company average. Geographically, 13 of the 14 U.S. regions experienced increases in comparable store sales, as sales performance was well balanced across the country.\nGross margin - Gross margin of 34.79% for 2014 represented a 20 basis point increase from 2013 and was primarily driven by cost reductions associated with our Value Improvement initiative, which consisted of improved line review and product reset processes to better position us to meet customers' product needs and drive better inventory productivity.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, gross margin decreased one basis point as a percentage of sales. Gross margin was negatively impacted by mix of products sold and price actions on specific categories, partially offset by our Value Improvement program and better seasonal sell-through.\nSG&A - SG&A expense for 2014 leveraged 46 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to 2013. This was primarily driven by 21 basis points of leverage associated with operating salaries as we optimized payroll hours against customer traffic. We also experienced 16 basis points of leverage associated with incentive compensation due to lower attainment levels compared to the prior year and seven basis points of leverage in property taxes due to favorability in property valuations recognized in the current year. In addition, we experienced six basis points of leverage in advertising expense due to increased sales and five basis points of leverage in utilities due to decreased consumption due to favorable weather experienced in the current year. These were partially offset by 23 basis points of deleverage in employee insurance costs, due to increased claims as well as additional costs associated with the Affordable Care Act.\nSG&A expense during the fourth quarter leveraged 88 basis points due primarily to long-lived asset impairments recorded in the prior year, as well as leverage in operating salaries, and property taxes.\nDepreciation - Depreciation expense leveraged 10 basis points for 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the increase in sales. Property, less accumulated depreciation, decreased to $20.0 billion at January 30, 2015 compared to $20.8 billion at January 31, 2014. At January 30, 2015 and January 31, 2014, we owned 86% of our stores, which included stores on leased land.\nInterest - Net - Net interest expense is comprised of the following:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net of amount capitalized\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>474\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of original issue discount and loan costs\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest - net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of $1.25 billion and $1.0 billion of unsecured notes in September 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nIncome tax provision - Our effective income tax rate was 36.9% in 2014 compared to 37.8% in 2013. The lower effective tax rate in 2014 was the result of the favorable settlement of certain federal tax matters during the year.\nLOWE'S BUSINESS OUTLOOK\nFiscal year 2016 will consist of 53 weeks, whereas fiscal year 2015 consisted of 52 weeks. As of February 24, 2016, the date of our fourth quarter 2015 earnings release, we expected total sales in 2016 to increase approximately 6%, including the 53rd week. The 53rd week is expected to increase total sales by approximately 1.5%. We expected comparable sales to increase approximately 4%. We expected to open approximately 45 home improvement and hardware stores during 2016. In addition, earnings before interest and taxes as a percentage of sales (operating margin) were expected to increase 80 to 90 basis points,1 and the effective tax rate was expected to be approximately 38.1%. Diluted earnings per share of approximately $4.00 were expected for the fiscal year ending February 3, 2017. Our guidance assumed approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchases during 2016.\n 1 Operating margin growth excludes the impact of the non-cash impairment charge on the Australian joint venture. The non-cash impairment charge negatively impacted operating margin by approximately 90 basis points in fiscal year 2015. \nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activities for each of the three most recent fiscal years ended January 29, 2016:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>4,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(1,343\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,088\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,286\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(3,493\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,761\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,969\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows from operating activities continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 versus 2014 was primarily driven by changes in working capital. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 versus 2013 was primarily driven by increased net earnings, as well as changes in working capital.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities for 2015 versus 2014 was primarily driven by increased capital expenditures and purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities, partially offset by decreased contributions to equity method investments. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities for 2014 versus 2013 was primarily driven by the acquisition of Orchard in 2013 and decreased capital expenditures, partially offset by increased contributions to equity method investments in 2014.\nThe decrease in net cash used in financing activities for 2015 versus 2014 was driven primarily by increased proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and net repayments of short-term borrowings in the prior year versus net borrowings in the current year. This was partially offset by increased repayments of long-term debt and increased cash dividend payments in the current year. The increase in net cash used in financing activities for 2014 versus 2013 was driven primarily by 2014 repayments of 2013 short-term borrowings.\nSources of Liquidity\nIn addition to our cash flows from operations, liquidity is provided by our short-term borrowing facilities. We have a $1.75 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement (the 2014 Credit Facility) with a syndicate of banks that expires in August 2019. Subject to obtaining commitments from the lenders and satisfying other conditions specified in the 2014 Credit Facility, we may increase the aggregate availability by an additional $500 million. The 2014 Credit Facility supports our commercial paper program and has a $500 million letter of credit sublimit. Letters of credit issued pursuant to the facility reduce the amount available for borrowing under its terms. Borrowings made are unsecured and are priced at fixed rates based upon market conditions at the time of funding in accordance with the terms of the facility. The 2014 Credit Facility contains certain restrictive covenants, which include maintenance of an adjusted debt leverage ratio as defined by the credit agreement. We were in compliance with those covenants at January 29, 2016. As of January 29, 2016, there were $43 million of outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program and no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under the credit facility.\nWe expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both short-term and long-term bases when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new long-term debt. The availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected, however, by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios. The table below reflects our debt ratings by Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Moody's as of March 28, 2016, which we are disclosing to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds. Although we currently do not expect a downgrade in our debt ratings, our commercial paper and senior debt ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Ratings\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Paper\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Debt\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outlook\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that net cash provided by operating and financing activities will be adequate not only for our operating requirements, but also for investments in our existing stores, investments in information technology, expansion plans,\nacquisitions, if any, and to return cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases over the next 12 months. There are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price. In addition, we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held in foreign affiliates to fund domestic operations. Unrepatriated cash was not significant for all periods presented.\nCash Requirements\nCapital expenditures\nOur fiscal 2016 capital forecast is approximately $1.5 billion. Our expansion plans are expected to account for approximately 45% of planned net cash outflow. Investments in our existing stores, including investments in remerchandising, store equipment, and technology, are expected to account for approximately 30% of net cash outflow. Approximately 20% of planned net cash outflow is for corporate programs, including investments to enhance the customer experience, as well as enhancements to the corporate infrastructure. Other planned capital expenditures, accounting for approximately 5% of planned net cash outflow, are for investments in our existing distribution network.\nOn February 2, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of RONA for C$24 per share in cash and preferred shares for C$20 per share in cash, for a total transaction price of approximately C$3.2 billion. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of Lowe's and RONA and is supported by the management teams of both companies; however, the transaction is subject to both shareholder and regulatory approvals. We anticipate financing the transaction through the debt capital markets. In addition, we have entered into an option to purchase Canadian dollars at a strike price of 1.3933 expiring November 1, 2016. The transaction is expected to close in fiscal year 2016.\nDebt and capital\nUnsecured debt of $475 million and $550 million is scheduled to mature in April and October 2016, respectively. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding long-term debt, including fiscal year 2015 financing activities.\nWe have an ongoing share repurchase program, authorized by the Company's Board of Directors, that is executed through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private off-market transactions. Shares purchased under the repurchase program are retired and returned to authorized and unissued status. As of January 29, 2016, we had $3.6 billion remaining available under our share repurchase program with no expiration date. In fiscal 2016, we expect to repurchase shares totaling $3.5 billion through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private off market transactions in accordance with SEC regulations. Our share repurchase assumption is not expected to be affected by the RONA acquisition. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding share repurchases.\nDividends declared during fiscal 2015 totaled $991 million. Our dividend payment dates are established such that dividends are paid in the quarter immediately following the quarter in which they are declared. The dividend declared in the fourth quarter of 2015 was paid in fiscal 2016 and totaled $255 million.\nOur ratio of debt to equity plus debt was 62.3% and 53.3% as of January 29, 2016, and January 30, 2015, respectively.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nOther than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at January 29, 2016:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations (in millions)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (principal amounts, excluding discount and debt issuance costs)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (interest payments)\n</td> <td>8,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized lease obligations 1, 2\n</td> <td>991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases 1\n</td> <td>5,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations 3\n</td> <td>1,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Commitments (in millions)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of Credit 4\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n 1 Amounts do not include taxes, common area maintenance, insurance, or contingent rent because these amounts have historically been insignificant. \n 2 Amounts include imputed interest and residual values. \n 3 Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding, and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase obligations include firm commitments related to certain marketing and information technology programs, as well as purchases of merchandise inventory. \n 4 Letters of credit are issued primarily for insurance and construction contracts. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this Form 10-K requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\nMerchandise Inventory\nDescription\nWe record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost. This reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience. During 2015, our reserve decreased approximately $6 million to $46 million as of January 29, 2016.\nWe also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories. This reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage results from previous physical inventories. During 2015, the inventory shrinkage reserve increased approximately $9 million to $171 million as of January 29, 2016.\nIn addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, sales, early payments or promotions of vendors' products. Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor's product. Therefore, we treat these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory as the amounts are accrued, and recognize these funds as a reduction of cost of sales when the\ninventory is sold. Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related expense.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nWe do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions. However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves. Likewise, changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories. We also apply judgment in the determination of levels of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value.\nFor vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place. Due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded. Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years. We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves. However, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves. A 10% change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $2 million for 2015. A 10% change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrinkage reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $10 million for 2015.\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory. However, substantially all receivables associated with these activities do not require subjective long-term estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year. Adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material.\nEquity Method Investments\nDescription\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. Our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. Each of the Company's equity method investments is subject to a review for impairment if, and when, circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment could be less than the carrying value. If the results of our review indicate an other than temporary decline in the carrying value of our investment, the Company would write down the investment to its estimated fair value.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nOur impairment evaluations for equity method investments require us to apply judgment in determining whether a decrease in value that is other than temporary has occurred. If we need to assess the recoverability of our equity method investments, we will make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows of those investments. These calculations require us to apply judgments, including assumptions of future performance, based on business plans and forecasts, recent economic and business trends, and competitive conditions.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we made the decision to exit our Australian joint venture investment with Woolworths Limited (Woolworths) and recorded a $530 million impairment of our investment due to a determination that there was a decrease in value that was other than temporary. We own a one-third share in the joint venture, Hydrox Holdings Pty Ltd., which operates Masters Home Improvement stores and Home Timber and Hardware Group's retail stores and wholesale distribution in Australia. As a result of our decision to exit, Woolworths will be required to purchase Lowe's one-third share in the joint venture at an agreed upon fair value as of January 18, 2016, the date of our notification of our intention to exit. The process for the two parties agreeing on fair value is prescribed in the Joint Venture Agreement. Finalization of the purchase price for Lowe's interest in the joint venture and completion of the sale is expected to occur in 2016. The $530 million non-cash impairment charge, which includes the cumulative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar over the life of the investment,\nwas based on the Company's estimate of the value of its portion of the overall joint venture fair value. This value was determined using an income approach based on expected discounted cash flows, and was validated for reasonableness by comparison to similar transaction multiples. The assumptions that most significantly affect the fair value determination include the continuation as a going concern, projected revenues, projected margin rates and the discount rate. Further changes in this estimate are possible as the parties proceed through the final stages of the valuation process as defined in the Joint Venture Agreement. A 10% change in our current estimate of fair value of the joint venture would have affected net earnings by approximately $39 million for 2015.\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment\nDescription\nWe review the carrying amounts of locations whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. When evaluating locations for impairment, our asset group is at an individual location level, as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable. Cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead.\nWe evaluate locations for triggering events relating to long-lived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location's asset carrying values may not be recoverable. For operating locations, our primary indicator that asset carrying values may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a 12-month period for those locations that have been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results. Management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment, including individual locations' execution of their operating plans and local market conditions, including incursion, which is the opening of either other Lowe's locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market. We also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\nA potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location's assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets. When determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location, management makes assumptions, incorporating local market conditions, about key store variables including sales growth rates, gross margin and controllable expenses, such as store payroll and occupancy expense, as well as asset residual values or lease rates. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.\nWe use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations, which requires discounting projected future cash flows. This involves making assumptions regarding both a location's future cash flows, as described above, and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows. We discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows. The selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nOur impairment evaluations for long-lived assets require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred, including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows, including estimated sales, margin, and controllable expenses, assumptions about market performance for operating locations, and estimated selling prices or lease rates for locations identified for closure. We also apply judgment in estimating asset fair values, including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair values determined using an income approach.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nDuring 2015, two operating locations experienced a triggering event, and both locations were determined to be impaired. We recorded impairment losses related to these two operating locations of $8 million during 2015, compared to impairment losses of $26 million related to three operating locations impaired during 2014.\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flows of operating locations or locations identified for closure during the past three fiscal years. If the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its useful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values, our actual impairment losses could vary positively or negatively from our estimated impairment losses.\nSelf-Insurance\nDescription\nWe are self-insured for certain losses relating to workers' compensation, automobile, general and product liability, extended protection plan, and certain medical and dental claims. Our self-insured retention or deductible, as applicable, is limited to $2 million per occurrence involving workers' compensation, $5 million per occurrence involving general or product liability, and $10 million per occurrence involving automobile. We do not have any insurance coverage for self-insured extended protection plan or medical and dental claims. Self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for self-insured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience. During 2015, our self-insurance liability decreased approximately $22 million to $883 million as of January 29, 2016.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nThese estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment, utilized discount rate, projected exposures including payroll, sales and vehicle units, as well as the frequency, lag and severity of claims.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our self-insurance liability during the past three fiscal years. Although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded self-insurance liabilities. A 10% change in our self-insurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately $54 million for 2015. A 100 basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately $18 million for 2015.\nRevenue Recognition\nDescription\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies. The following accounting estimates relating to revenue recognition require management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the effects of future events that cannot be determined with certainty.\nWe sell separately-priced extended protection plan contracts under a Lowe's-branded program for which the Company is ultimately self-insured. The Company recognizes revenues from extended protection plan sales on a straight-line basis over the respective contract term. Extended protection plan contract terms primarily range from one to four years from the date of purchase or the end of the manufacturer's warranty, as applicable. The Company consistently groups and evaluates extended protection plan contracts based on the characteristics of the underlying products and the coverage provided in order to monitor for expected losses. A loss on the overall contract would be recognized if the expected costs of performing services under the contracts exceeded the amount of unamortized acquisition costs and related deferred revenue associated with the contracts. Deferred revenues associated with the extended protection plan contracts decreased $1 million to $729 million as of January 29, 2016.\nWe defer revenue and cost of sales associated with settled transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed. Revenue is deferred based on the actual amounts received. We use historical gross margin rates to estimate the adjustment to cost of sales for these transactions. During 2015, deferred revenues associated with these transactions increased $74 million to $619 million as of January 29, 2016.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nFor extended protection plans, there is judgment inherent in our evaluation of expected losses as a result of our methodology for grouping and evaluating extended protection plan contracts and from the actuarial determination of the estimated cost of the contracts. There is also judgment inherent in our determination of the recognition pattern of costs of performing services under these contracts.\nFor the deferral of revenue and cost of sales associated with transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed, there is judgment inherent in our estimates of gross margin rates.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize revenue on our extended protection plan contracts during the past three fiscal years. We currently do not anticipate incurring any overall contract losses on our extended protection plan contracts. Although we believe that we have the ability to adequately monitor and estimate expected losses\nunder the extended protection plan contracts, it is possible that actual results could differ from our estimates. In addition, if future evidence indicates that the costs of performing services under these contracts are incurred on other than a straight-line basis, the timing of revenue recognition under these contracts could change. A 10% change in the amount of revenue recognized in 2015 under these contracts would have affected net earnings by approximately $22 million.\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to reverse net sales and cost of sales related to amounts received for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed. We believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates related to the impact to cost of sales for these transactions. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may incur additional income or expense. A 10% change in the estimate of the gross margin rates applied to these transactions would have affected net earnings by approximately $10 million in 2015.\nDISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nWe speak throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K in forward-looking statements about our future, but particularly in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d.

Unless otherwise noted, all references herein for the years 2015, 2014 and 2013 represent the fiscal years ended January 29, 2016, January 30, 2015 and January 31, 2014, respectively. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. This discussion and analysis is presented in seven sections:\n \u2022 Executive Overview \n \u2022 Operations \n \u2022 Lowe's Business Outlook \n \u2022 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources \n \u2022 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n \u2022 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nNet sales for 2015 were $59.1 billion, a 5.1% increase over fiscal year 2014. Comparable sales increased 4.8%, driven by a comparable average ticket increase of 2.5% and a comparable transaction increase of 2.2%. Net earnings, which were negatively impacted by an impairment charge discussed below, declined 5.6% to $2.5 billion. Diluted earnings per common share increased to $2.73 from $2.71 in 2014.\nResults for 2015 were negatively impacted by a $530 million non-cash impairment charge associated with our decision to exit the Australian home improvement market by withdrawing from our joint venture with Woolworths Limited. Excluding the impact of this charge, adjusted net income totaled $3.1 billion, an increase of 14.0% over 2014, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 21.4% to $3.29 (see discussion on non-GAAP financial measures beginning on page 21).\nFor 2015, cash flows from operating activities were approximately $4.8 billion, with $1.2 billion used for capital expenditures. Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, the company repurchased 53.5 million shares of stock through the share repurchase program for $3.8 billion and paid $957 million in dividends during the year.\nThroughout 2015, we remained committed to our key priorities, capitalizing on opportunities within an improving economy and further pursue top line growth through differentiating ourselves with better customer experiences, improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer, and driving productivity and profitability. In addition, we continued to enhance our omni-channel capabilities, providing not just the products, but also the services, information, and advice to help our customers at every step of the home improvement journey and build a greater affinity for the Lowe's brand.\nThrough collaboration between our merchants, stores, and customer experience design team, we leveraged our customer experience design capabilities as well as our larger store format to showcase the Outdoor Living Experience and the Holiday D\u00e9cor Experience which drove strong sales and attachment for products during the year. To help customers envision and create their outdoor spaces for spring, we displayed patio sets with coordinating rugs, umbrellas, and accessories, along with grills and other outdoor products just as they would have expected in their own backyard. This space was re-purposed for the Holiday D\u00e9cor Experience in the second half of the year which inspired customers to decorate, raised awareness of the breadth of holiday d\u00e9cor and gift offerings, and provided project solutions relevant to the holiday micro seasons. By providing an integrative and cohesive assortment of products, inspiring and intuitive presentation and display, and optimal service components across all selling channels, we are able to provide better customer experiences that differentiate us in the marketplace.\nWe remained committed to building on our strong foundation with the Pro customer by continuing to advance our product and service offerings to meet their unique needs. Throughout the year, we have strengthened our portfolio of Pro-focused brands with the addition of both national and local brands. In addition, our re-launch of LowesForPros.com in the first half of the year provides the Pro customer with an easy online ordering experience with their choice of in-store pick-up or delivery, saving the Pro time and money. The site makes it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and easily purchase items for their locations\nnationwide. We are also reconnecting with Pro customers through targeted marketing, as well as Pro-focused events to drive awareness and generate new business.\nIn an effort to drive expense productivity during 2015, we effectively managed payroll hours on solid comparable sales growth and improved productivity in advertising through targeted spend. We increased the efficiency and effectiveness of our marketing spend through optimized media allocation, presence in targeted digital advertising, expanded social media presence, and reduced print advertising, all while maintaining our customer reach and improving exposure. In addition to payroll and marketing expenses, we remain committed to identifying and implementing additional expense efficiencies by leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend, which improves the flow through of sales dollars to operating profit.\nWe also continued to enhance our omni-channel capabilities in 2015. Online, we have enhanced our customer experience and presentation through Lowes.com, including improved product search, integrated and upgraded product videos, enhanced product presentation, and simplified product groupings to make it easy for customers to make their selections. Our in-home selling networks, including both interior and exterior project specialists, continued to expand with exterior specialists available across all US stores and interior specialists expected in all stores by the end of fiscal year 2016.\nLooking Forward\nEconomic forecasts for 2016 suggest the outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive. Continued support from steady job growth and improved household incomes, as well as favorable trends in the housing market, should keep home improvement growth buoyant. Despite recent volatility in the financial markets, the fundamentals for continued growth in consumer spending remain intact. Consumers should continue to benefit from improved household financial conditions and lower gas prices on top of moderate job and income growth.\nAs we move into 2016, we continue to take a prudent approach to managing our portfolio of businesses, making decisions that will shape how we better serve and connect with customers. With the decision to exit the Australian home improvement market during the fourth quarter of 2015, we will focus our resources on areas of the business where we see greater potential return on investment. In early 2016, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire RONA inc. (RONA), a major Canadian retailer and distributor of hardware, building materials, and home renovation products. This transaction is expected to accelerate Lowe's growth strategy by significantly expanding our presence in the Canadian market through the addition of RONA's attractive business and store locations. The transaction is subject to RONA common shareholder approval and receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the second half of 2016.\nAt the same time we are reinforcing our international business, we will remain focused on growing sales by continuing to differentiate ourselves through better customer experiences that make us the project authority, improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer, and enhancing our omni-channel capabilities to support customers at every step of their home improvement journey. We will also focus on driving productivity and profitability through payroll and marketing optimization and leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend. This strategic framework along with our efforts to improve productivity and profitability give us confidence in our Business Outlook for 2016.\nOPERATIONS\nThe following tables set forth the percentage relationship to net sales of each line item of the consolidated statements of earnings, as well as the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year. This table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n 1 EBIT margin, also referred to as operating margin, is defined as earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) as a percentage of sales. EBIT margin for fiscal year 2015 was adjusted to exclude the negative 90 basis points impact of the non-cash impairment charge on the Australian joint venture with Woolworths (Adjusted EBIT margin). Adjusted EBIT is a non-GAAP financial measure. See below for additional information and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure. \n 2 A comparable location is defined as a location that has been open longer than 13 months. A location that is identified for relocation is no longer considered comparable one month prior to its relocation. The relocated location must then remain open longer than 13 months to be considered comparable. A location we have decided to close is no longer considered comparable as of the beginning of the month in which we announce its closing. Acquired locations are included in the comparable sales calculation beginning in the first full month following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. Comparable sales include online sales, which did not have a meaningful impact for the periods presented. \n 3 Average ticket is defined as net sales divided by the total number of customer transactions. \n 4 Average store size selling square feet is defined as sales floor square feet divided by the number of stores open at the end of the period. The average Lowe's home improvement store has approximately 112,000 square feet of retail selling space, while the average Orchard store has approximately 37,000 square feet of retail selling space. \n 5 Return on average assets is defined as net earnings divided by average total assets for the last five quarters. \n 6 Return on average shareholders' equity is defined as net earnings divided by average shareholders' equity for the last five quarters. \n 7 Return on invested capital is a non-GAAP financial measure. See below for additional information and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure. \n 8 Fiscal years 2014 and 2013 have been adjusted as a result of the Company's retrospective adoption of ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, and ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The adoption of these accounting standards required reclassification of current deferred tax assets and liabilities to non-current, as well as reclassification of debt issuance costs from other assets to long-term debt, excluding current maturities. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nReturn on Invested Capital\nWe believe Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is a meaningful metric for investors because it measures how effectively the Company uses capital to generate profits.\nWe define ROIC as trailing four quarters' net operating profit after tax divided by the average of ending debt and equity for the last five quarters. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly, the method used by our management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC. We encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its ROIC before comparing its ROIC to ours.\nWe consider return on average debt and equity to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to ROIC. The difference between these two measures is that ROIC adjusts net earnings to exclude tax adjusted interest expense.\nThe calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation to the calculation of return on average debt and equity, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:\n\n 1 Income tax adjustment is defined as earnings before interest and taxes multiplied by the effective tax rate. \n 2 Average debt and equity is defined as average debt, including current maturities and short-term borrowings, plus total equity for the last five quarters. \n 3 Fiscal years 2014 and 2013 have been adjusted as a result of the Company's retrospective adoption of ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The adoption of this accounting standard required reclassification of debt issuance costs from other assets to long-term debt, excluding current maturities. \n 4 ROIC for fiscal year 2015 was negatively impacted by approximately 238 basis points due to the non-cash impairment charge on the Australian joint venture with Woolworths. \nAdjusted Net Earnings, Adjusted EBIT, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\nWe have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted net earnings, adjusted EBIT, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which exclude the impact of the $530 million non-cash impairment charge recognized during 2015 in connection with the Company's decision to exit its joint venture with Woolworths Limited in Australia. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful insight for investors in evaluating what management considers the Company's core financial performance. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nAdjusted net earnings, adjusted EBIT, and adjusted diluted earnings per share should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net earnings and diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company's methods of determining these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the methods used by other companies for these or similar non-GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the measures used by other companies.\nThe most comparable GAAP measures are net earnings and diluted earnings per share. The following provides a reconciliation of adjusted net earnings, adjusted EBIT, and adjusted diluted earnings per share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures:\n\nFiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014\nNet sales - Net sales increased 5.1% to $59.1 billion in 2015. The increase in total sales was driven primarily by the comparable sales increase of 4.8% and new stores. The comparable sales increase of 4.8% in 2015 was driven by a 2.5% increase in comparable average ticket and a 2.2% increase in comparable customer transactions. Comparable sales during each quarter of the fiscal year, as reported, were 5.2% in the first quarter, 4.3% in the second quarter, 4.6% in the third quarter, and 5.2% in the fourth quarter.\nAll of our product categories experienced comparable sales increases for the year. During 2015, comparable sales were above the company average in the following product categories: Appliances, Outdoor Power Equipment, and Seasonal Living. Appliances experienced the strongest growth with a double digit increase in comparable sales as we further strengthened our brand offerings and breadth of assortment and continued to provide service advantages with next-day delivery and haul away. Within Outdoor Power Equipment, we drove strong performance in walk behind and riding mowers as well as pressure washers. The Outdoor Living Experience introduced last year drove comparable sales in our Seasonal Living category, where we continued to see strong sales in patio furniture, replacement cushions, and outdoor accessories. In addition, Tools & Hardware performed at approximately the overall company average driven by strong demand and continued improvement in both product assortment and brand relevance. Geographically, all of our 14 U.S. regions experienced increases in comparable store sales, as sales performance was well balanced across the country.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded comparable sales increases above the company average in Lumber & Building Materials, Appliances, Lawn & Garden, and Paint. We saw particular strength in outdoor project categories, led by Lumber & Building Materials and Lawn & Garden, as customers took advantage of mild weather to complete exterior projects such as roofs, fences, decks, and lawn care. Our landscape lighting experience also drove strong performance by providing inspiration and easy selection and installation for customers, while offering new product technologies such as LED. We achieved strong comparable sales increases in Appliances during the quarter through strengthened brand offerings and service advantages. Paint benefited from increased project activity, as well as growing awareness of our three-brand offering, providing customers with a full suite of top brands they can trust for their next paint project.\nGross margin - Gross margin of 34.82% for 2015 represented a three basis point increase from 2014 and was primarily driven by cost reductions associated with value improvement and product cost deflation, partially offset by negative impacts from targeted promotional activity and mix of products sold.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, gross margin of 34.66% was flat as a percentage of sales due to the same factors that impacted gross margin in the year.\nSG&A - SG&A expense for 2015 deleveraged 28 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to 2014. This was primarily driven by 90 basis points of deleverage associated with an impairment charge recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the valuation of our one-third interest in the Australian joint venture with Woolworths Limited. This was partially offset by 16 basis points of leverage associated with operating salaries as we optimized payroll hours against customer traffic and 16\nbasis points of leverage in advertising expense due to more efficient and effective media mix compared to the prior year. We experienced eight basis points of leverage in employee insurance costs due to increased sales in the current year partially offset by additional costs associated with the Affordable Care Act. We also experienced eight basis points of leverage in utilities due to stronger sales as well as a decrease in rates and consumption. In addition, we experienced seven basis points of leverage in building and site repair due to a decrease in the number of repairs during the year and seven basis points of leverage in external labor due to completed projects and increased focus on use of internal resources across information technology projects.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, SG&A expense deleveraged 332 basis points as a percentage of sales due primarily to 401 basis points of deleverage associated with the Australian joint venture impairment charge partially offset by leverage in operating salaries, advertising expense, utilities, employee insurance, and certain other fixed costs. We experienced 25 basis points of leverage in operating salaries associated with optimization of store payroll hours and 20 basis points in advertising expense due to more efficient and effective media mix. We also experienced 12 basis points of leverage in utilities primarily the result of warmer weather and 12 basis points in employee insurance costs due to a reduction in the number and severity of claims. Certain other fixed costs also leveraged as a result of sales growth.\nDepreciation - Depreciation expense leveraged 13 basis points for 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the increase in sales. Property, less accumulated depreciation, decreased to $19.6 billion at January 29, 2016 compared to $20.0 billion at January 30, 2015. At January 29, 2016 and January 30, 2015, we owned 86% of our stores, which included stores on leased land.\nInterest - Net - Net interest expense is comprised of the following:\n\nNet interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of $1.75 billion and $1.25 billion of unsecured notes in September 2015 and 2014, respectively. This was partially offset by the repayment of $500 million unsecured notes on October 15, 2015.\nIncome tax provision - Our effective income tax rate was 42.4% in 2015 compared to 36.9% in 2014. During 2015, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset related to losses associated with the joint venture investment in Australia with Woolworths Limited. The deferred tax asset associated with these losses was offset with the establishment of a full valuation allowance due to the fact the benefit of these losses can only be realized to the extent the Company has available capital gains for offset, and no present or future capital gains have been identified through which this deferred tax asset can be realized. Excluding the equity losses and related deferred tax asset would have resulted in an effective income tax rate of 38.2%. The effective tax rate in 2014 benefited from the favorable settlement of certain federal tax matters.\nFiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013\nNet sales - Net sales increased 5.3% to $56.2 billion in 2014. The increase in total sales was driven primarily by the comparable sales increase of 4.3%, the acquisition of Orchard, and new stores. The comparable sales increase of 4.3% in 2014 was driven by a 2.4% increase in comparable average ticket and a 1.8% increase in comparable customer transactions. Comparable sales increased during each quarter of the fiscal year as we reported 0.9% in the first quarter, 4.4% in the second quarter, 5.1% in the third quarter, and 7.3% in the fourth quarter.\nAll of our product categories experienced comparable sales increases for the year. During 2014, we experienced comparable sales above the company average in the following product categories: Appliances, Millwork, Tools & Hardware, Fashion Fixtures, and Outdoor Power Equipment. Targeted promotions coupled with the expansion of our Project Specialist programs drove comparable sales increases, especially within Appliances, Millwork, and Fashion Fixtures, as we continued to benefit from customers' increasing interest in refreshing both the interior and exterior of their homes. Within Tools & Hardware, our enhanced Sales & Operations Planning process helped us drive strong performance in power and pneumatic tools. We drove comparable sales within Outdoor Power Equipment as we were prepared to meet strong demand for mowers, trimmers, and snow blowers. In addition, Flooring performed at approximately the overall company average. Geographically, 13 of the 14 U.S. regions experienced increases in comparable store sales, as sales performance was well balanced across the country.\nGross margin - Gross margin of 34.79% for 2014 represented a 20 basis point increase from 2013 and was primarily driven by cost reductions associated with our Value Improvement initiative, which consisted of improved line review and product reset processes to better position us to meet customers' product needs and drive better inventory productivity.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, gross margin decreased one basis point as a percentage of sales. Gross margin was negatively impacted by mix of products sold and price actions on specific categories, partially offset by our Value Improvement program and better seasonal sell-through.\nSG&A - SG&A expense for 2014 leveraged 46 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to 2013. This was primarily driven by 21 basis points of leverage associated with operating salaries as we optimized payroll hours against customer traffic. We also experienced 16 basis points of leverage associated with incentive compensation due to lower attainment levels compared to the prior year and seven basis points of leverage in property taxes due to favorability in property valuations recognized in the current year. In addition, we experienced six basis points of leverage in advertising expense due to increased sales and five basis points of leverage in utilities due to decreased consumption due to favorable weather experienced in the current year. These were partially offset by 23 basis points of deleverage in employee insurance costs, due to increased claims as well as additional costs associated with the Affordable Care Act.\nSG&A expense during the fourth quarter leveraged 88 basis points due primarily to long-lived asset impairments recorded in the prior year, as well as leverage in operating salaries, and property taxes.\nDepreciation - Depreciation expense leveraged 10 basis points for 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the increase in sales. Property, less accumulated depreciation, decreased to $20.0 billion at January 30, 2015 compared to $20.8 billion at January 31, 2014. At January 30, 2015 and January 31, 2014, we owned 86% of our stores, which included stores on leased land.\nInterest - Net - Net interest expense is comprised of the following:\n\nNet interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of $1.25 billion and $1.0 billion of unsecured notes in September 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nIncome tax provision - Our effective income tax rate was 36.9% in 2014 compared to 37.8% in 2013. The lower effective tax rate in 2014 was the result of the favorable settlement of certain federal tax matters during the year.\nLOWE'S BUSINESS OUTLOOK\nFiscal year 2016 will consist of 53 weeks, whereas fiscal year 2015 consisted of 52 weeks. As of February 24, 2016, the date of our fourth quarter 2015 earnings release, we expected total sales in 2016 to increase approximately 6%, including the 53rd week. The 53rd week is expected to increase total sales by approximately 1.5%. We expected comparable sales to increase approximately 4%. We expected to open approximately 45 home improvement and hardware stores during 2016. In addition, earnings before interest and taxes as a percentage of sales (operating margin) were expected to increase 80 to 90 basis points,1 and the effective tax rate was expected to be approximately 38.1%. Diluted earnings per share of approximately $4.00 were expected for the fiscal year ending February 3, 2017. Our guidance assumed approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchases during 2016.\n 1 Operating margin growth excludes the impact of the non-cash impairment charge on the Australian joint venture. The non-cash impairment charge negatively impacted operating margin by approximately 90 basis points in fiscal year 2015. \nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activities for each of the three most recent fiscal years ended January 29, 2016:\n\nCash flows from operating activities continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 versus 2014 was primarily driven by changes in working capital. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 versus 2013 was primarily driven by increased net earnings, as well as changes in working capital.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities for 2015 versus 2014 was primarily driven by increased capital expenditures and purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities, partially offset by decreased contributions to equity method investments. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities for 2014 versus 2013 was primarily driven by the acquisition of Orchard in 2013 and decreased capital expenditures, partially offset by increased contributions to equity method investments in 2014.\nThe decrease in net cash used in financing activities for 2015 versus 2014 was driven primarily by increased proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and net repayments of short-term borrowings in the prior year versus net borrowings in the current year. This was partially offset by increased repayments of long-term debt and increased cash dividend payments in the current year. The increase in net cash used in financing activities for 2014 versus 2013 was driven primarily by 2014 repayments of 2013 short-term borrowings.\nSources of Liquidity\nIn addition to our cash flows from operations, liquidity is provided by our short-term borrowing facilities. We have a $1.75 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement (the 2014 Credit Facility) with a syndicate of banks that expires in August 2019. Subject to obtaining commitments from the lenders and satisfying other conditions specified in the 2014 Credit Facility, we may increase the aggregate availability by an additional $500 million. The 2014 Credit Facility supports our commercial paper program and has a $500 million letter of credit sublimit. Letters of credit issued pursuant to the facility reduce the amount available for borrowing under its terms. Borrowings made are unsecured and are priced at fixed rates based upon market conditions at the time of funding in accordance with the terms of the facility. The 2014 Credit Facility contains certain restrictive covenants, which include maintenance of an adjusted debt leverage ratio as defined by the credit agreement. We were in compliance with those covenants at January 29, 2016. As of January 29, 2016, there were $43 million of outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program and no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under the credit facility.\nWe expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both short-term and long-term bases when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new long-term debt. The availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected, however, by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios. The table below reflects our debt ratings by Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Moody's as of March 28, 2016, which we are disclosing to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds. Although we currently do not expect a downgrade in our debt ratings, our commercial paper and senior debt ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\n\nWe believe that net cash provided by operating and financing activities will be adequate not only for our operating requirements, but also for investments in our existing stores, investments in information technology, expansion plans,\nacquisitions, if any, and to return cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases over the next 12 months. There are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price. In addition, we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held in foreign affiliates to fund domestic operations. Unrepatriated cash was not significant for all periods presented.\nCash Requirements\nCapital expenditures\nOur fiscal 2016 capital forecast is approximately $1.5 billion. Our expansion plans are expected to account for approximately 45% of planned net cash outflow. Investments in our existing stores, including investments in remerchandising, store equipment, and technology, are expected to account for approximately 30% of net cash outflow. Approximately 20% of planned net cash outflow is for corporate programs, including investments to enhance the customer experience, as well as enhancements to the corporate infrastructure. Other planned capital expenditures, accounting for approximately 5% of planned net cash outflow, are for investments in our existing distribution network.\nOn February 2, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of RONA for C$24 per share in cash and preferred shares for C$20 per share in cash, for a total transaction price of approximately C$3.2 billion. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of Lowe's and RONA and is supported by the management teams of both companies; however, the transaction is subject to both shareholder and regulatory approvals. We anticipate financing the transaction through the debt capital markets. In addition, we have entered into an option to purchase Canadian dollars at a strike price of 1.3933 expiring November 1, 2016. The transaction is expected to close in fiscal year 2016.\nDebt and capital\nUnsecured debt of $475 million and $550 million is scheduled to mature in April and October 2016, respectively. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding long-term debt, including fiscal year 2015 financing activities.\nWe have an ongoing share repurchase program, authorized by the Company's Board of Directors, that is executed through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private off-market transactions. Shares purchased under the repurchase program are retired and returned to authorized and unissued status. As of January 29, 2016, we had $3.6 billion remaining available under our share repurchase program with no expiration date. In fiscal 2016, we expect to repurchase shares totaling $3.5 billion through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private off market transactions in accordance with SEC regulations. Our share repurchase assumption is not expected to be affected by the RONA acquisition. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding share repurchases.\nDividends declared during fiscal 2015 totaled $991 million. Our dividend payment dates are established such that dividends are paid in the quarter immediately following the quarter in which they are declared. The dividend declared in the fourth quarter of 2015 was paid in fiscal 2016 and totaled $255 million.\nOur ratio of debt to equity plus debt was 62.3% and 53.3% as of January 29, 2016, and January 30, 2015, respectively.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nOther than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at January 29, 2016:\n\n 1 Amounts do not include taxes, common area maintenance, insurance, or contingent rent because these amounts have historically been insignificant. \n 2 Amounts include imputed interest and residual values. \n 3 Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding, and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase obligations include firm commitments related to certain marketing and information technology programs, as well as purchases of merchandise inventory. \n 4 Letters of credit are issued primarily for insurance and construction contracts. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this Form 10-K requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\nMerchandise Inventory\nDescription\nWe record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost. This reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience. During 2015, our reserve decreased approximately $6 million to $46 million as of January 29, 2016.\nWe also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories. This reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage results from previous physical inventories. During 2015, the inventory shrinkage reserve increased approximately $9 million to $171 million as of January 29, 2016.\nIn addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, sales, early payments or promotions of vendors' products. Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor's product. Therefore, we treat these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory as the amounts are accrued, and recognize these funds as a reduction of cost of sales when the\ninventory is sold. Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related expense.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nWe do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions. However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves. Likewise, changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories. We also apply judgment in the determination of levels of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value.\nFor vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place. Due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded. Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years. We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves. However, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves. A 10% change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $2 million for 2015. A 10% change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrinkage reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $10 million for 2015.\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory. However, substantially all receivables associated with these activities do not require subjective long-term estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year. Adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material.\nEquity Method Investments\nDescription\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. Our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. Each of the Company's equity method investments is subject to a review for impairment if, and when, circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment could be less than the carrying value. If the results of our review indicate an other than temporary decline in the carrying value of our investment, the Company would write down the investment to its estimated fair value.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nOur impairment evaluations for equity method investments require us to apply judgment in determining whether a decrease in value that is other than temporary has occurred. If we need to assess the recoverability of our equity method investments, we will make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows of those investments. These calculations require us to apply judgments, including assumptions of future performance, based on business plans and forecasts, recent economic and business trends, and competitive conditions.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we made the decision to exit our Australian joint venture investment with Woolworths Limited (Woolworths) and recorded a $530 million impairment of our investment due to a determination that there was a decrease in value that was other than temporary. We own a one-third share in the joint venture, Hydrox Holdings Pty Ltd., which operates Masters Home Improvement stores and Home Timber and Hardware Group's retail stores and wholesale distribution in Australia. As a result of our decision to exit, Woolworths will be required to purchase Lowe's one-third share in the joint venture at an agreed upon fair value as of January 18, 2016, the date of our notification of our intention to exit. The process for the two parties agreeing on fair value is prescribed in the Joint Venture Agreement. Finalization of the purchase price for Lowe's interest in the joint venture and completion of the sale is expected to occur in 2016. The $530 million non-cash impairment charge, which includes the cumulative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar over the life of the investment,\nwas based on the Company's estimate of the value of its portion of the overall joint venture fair value. This value was determined using an income approach based on expected discounted cash flows, and was validated for reasonableness by comparison to similar transaction multiples. The assumptions that most significantly affect the fair value determination include the continuation as a going concern, projected revenues, projected margin rates and the discount rate. Further changes in this estimate are possible as the parties proceed through the final stages of the valuation process as defined in the Joint Venture Agreement. A 10% change in our current estimate of fair value of the joint venture would have affected net earnings by approximately $39 million for 2015.\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment\nDescription\nWe review the carrying amounts of locations whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. When evaluating locations for impairment, our asset group is at an individual location level, as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable. Cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead.\nWe evaluate locations for triggering events relating to long-lived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location's asset carrying values may not be recoverable. For operating locations, our primary indicator that asset carrying values may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a 12-month period for those locations that have been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results. Management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment, including individual locations' execution of their operating plans and local market conditions, including incursion, which is the opening of either other Lowe's locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market. We also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\nA potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location's assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets. When determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location, management makes assumptions, incorporating local market conditions, about key store variables including sales growth rates, gross margin and controllable expenses, such as store payroll and occupancy expense, as well as asset residual values or lease rates. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.\nWe use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations, which requires discounting projected future cash flows. This involves making assumptions regarding both a location's future cash flows, as described above, and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows. We discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows. The selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nOur impairment evaluations for long-lived assets require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred, including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows, including estimated sales, margin, and controllable expenses, assumptions about market performance for operating locations, and estimated selling prices or lease rates for locations identified for closure. We also apply judgment in estimating asset fair values, including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair values determined using an income approach.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nDuring 2015, two operating locations experienced a triggering event, and both locations were determined to be impaired. We recorded impairment losses related to these two operating locations of $8 million during 2015, compared to impairment losses of $26 million related to three operating locations impaired during 2014.\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flows of operating locations or locations identified for closure during the past three fiscal years. If the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its useful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values, our actual impairment losses could vary positively or negatively from our estimated impairment losses.\nSelf-Insurance\nDescription\nWe are self-insured for certain losses relating to workers' compensation, automobile, general and product liability, extended protection plan, and certain medical and dental claims. Our self-insured retention or deductible, as applicable, is limited to $2 million per occurrence involving workers' compensation, $5 million per occurrence involving general or product liability, and $10 million per occurrence involving automobile. We do not have any insurance coverage for self-insured extended protection plan or medical and dental claims. Self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for self-insured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience. During 2015, our self-insurance liability decreased approximately $22 million to $883 million as of January 29, 2016.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nThese estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment, utilized discount rate, projected exposures including payroll, sales and vehicle units, as well as the frequency, lag and severity of claims.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our self-insurance liability during the past three fiscal years. Although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded self-insurance liabilities. A 10% change in our self-insurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately $54 million for 2015. A 100 basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately $18 million for 2015.\nRevenue Recognition\nDescription\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies. The following accounting estimates relating to revenue recognition require management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the effects of future events that cannot be determined with certainty.\nWe sell separately-priced extended protection plan contracts under a Lowe's-branded program for which the Company is ultimately self-insured. The Company recognizes revenues from extended protection plan sales on a straight-line basis over the respective contract term. Extended protection plan contract terms primarily range from one to four years from the date of purchase or the end of the manufacturer's warranty, as applicable. The Company consistently groups and evaluates extended protection plan contracts based on the characteristics of the underlying products and the coverage provided in order to monitor for expected losses. A loss on the overall contract would be recognized if the expected costs of performing services under the contracts exceeded the amount of unamortized acquisition costs and related deferred revenue associated with the contracts. Deferred revenues associated with the extended protection plan contracts decreased $1 million to $729 million as of January 29, 2016.\nWe defer revenue and cost of sales associated with settled transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed. Revenue is deferred based on the actual amounts received. We use historical gross margin rates to estimate the adjustment to cost of sales for these transactions. During 2015, deferred revenues associated with these transactions increased $74 million to $619 million as of January 29, 2016.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nFor extended protection plans, there is judgment inherent in our evaluation of expected losses as a result of our methodology for grouping and evaluating extended protection plan contracts and from the actuarial determination of the estimated cost of the contracts. There is also judgment inherent in our determination of the recognition pattern of costs of performing services under these contracts.\nFor the deferral of revenue and cost of sales associated with transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed, there is judgment inherent in our estimates of gross margin rates.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize revenue on our extended protection plan contracts during the past three fiscal years. We currently do not anticipate incurring any overall contract losses on our extended protection plan contracts. Although we believe that we have the ability to adequately monitor and estimate expected losses\nunder the extended protection plan contracts, it is possible that actual results could differ from our estimates. In addition, if future evidence indicates that the costs of performing services under these contracts are incurred on other than a straight-line basis, the timing of revenue recognition under these contracts could change. A 10% change in the amount of revenue recognized in 2015 under these contracts would have affected net earnings by approximately $22 million.\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to reverse net sales and cost of sales related to amounts received for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed. We believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates related to the impact to cost of sales for these transactions. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may incur additional income or expense. A 10% change in the estimate of the gross margin rates applied to these transactions would have affected net earnings by approximately $10 million in 2015.\nDISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nWe speak throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K in forward-looking statements about our future, but particularly in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d.

Comparable sales increased 4.8%.\n- Net earnings declined 5.6% to $2.5 billion due to a $530 million non-cash impairment charge related to exiting the Australian market. Excluding this, adjusted net earnings were up 14%. \n- Operating cash flows were $4.8 billion. Capital expenditures were $1.2 billion.\n\nResults\n- Comparable sales growth was driven by increases in average ticket and customer transactions. All product categories had positive comparable sales.\n- Gross margin improved slightly to 34.82% due to cost reductions and deflation. \n- SG&A deleveraged due to the impairment charge, partially offset by leverage in other areas like payroll and advertising.\n- Interest expense increased due to higher debt levels. Tax rate increased due to the impairment charge.\n\nOutlook\n- Expect sales growth of 6% in 2016, including an extra week. Comparable sales expected to increase 4%. \n- Operating margin expected to improve 80-90 bps excluding impairment charge.\n- Plan to repurchase $3.5 billion of stock and pay $1 per share dividend.\n\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\n- Generated cash flow from operations of $4.8 billion. Invested $1.2 billion in capital expenditures. \n- Have access to credit facilities and ability to issue long-term debt.\n- Plan $1.5 billion of capital expenditures in 2016 to fund expansion, investments in stores and technology.\n- Entered agreement to acquire RONA for $3.2 billion to expand Canadian presence.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions on the report!"}
