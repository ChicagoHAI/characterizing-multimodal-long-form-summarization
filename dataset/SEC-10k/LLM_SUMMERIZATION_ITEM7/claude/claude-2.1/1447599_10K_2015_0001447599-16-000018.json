Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed above in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Report.\nOverview\nOur mission is to help people lead healthier, more active lives by empowering them with data, inspiration, and guidance to reach their goals.\nFitbit is transforming the way millions of people around the world achieve their health and fitness goals. The Fitbit platform combines connected health and fitness devices with software and services, including an online dashboard and mobile apps, data analytics, motivational and social tools, personalized insights, and virtual coaching through customized fitness plans and interactive workouts. Our platform helps people become more active, exercise more, sleep better, eat smarter, and manage their weight. Fitbit appeals to a large, mainstream health and fitness market by addressing these key needs with advanced technology embedded in simple-to-use products and services. We pioneered the connected health and fitness market starting in 2007, and since then, we have grown into a leading global health and fitness brand.\nThe core of our platform is our family of eight wearable connected health and fitness trackers. These wrist-based and clippable\u201d devices automatically track users' daily steps, calories burned, distance traveled, and active minutes and display real-time feedback to encourage them to become more active in their daily lives. Most of our trackers also measure floors climbed, sleep duration and quality, and our more advanced products track heart rate and GPS-based information such as speed, distance, and exercise routes. Several of our devices also feature deeper integration with smartphones, such as the ability to receive call and text notifications and control music. In addition, we offer a Wi-Fi connected scale that records weight, body fat, and BMI. We are able to enhance the functionality and features of our connected devices through wireless updates. Our platform also includes our online dashboard and mobile apps, which wirelessly and automatically sync with our devices. Our platform allows our users to see trends and achievements, access motivational tools such as virtual badges and real-time progress notifications, and connect, support, and compete with friends and family. We intend to continue to significantly invest in research and development in order to enhance our products and services.\nWe design our products primarily in California and outsource the production of our devices to contract manufacturers, which are responsible for procuring most of the components used in the manufacturing of our products from third-party suppliers. We also outsource packaging and fulfillment to third-party logistics providers around the world.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from sales of our connected health and fitness devices. We sell our products in over 50,000 retail stores and in 63 countries, through our retailers' websites, through our online store at Fitbit.com, and as part of our corporate wellness offering. We seek to build global brand awareness, increase product adoption, and drive sales through our sales and marketing efforts. We intend to continue to significantly invest in these sales and marketing efforts in the future.\nOur growth will depend in part on the adoption and sale of our products and services in international markets. In recent periods, we have experienced significant growth in international sales. In 2015, 26% of our revenue, based on ship-to destinations, was from sales outside of the United States. We believe international markets represent a significant growth opportunity for us. We intend to expand sales of our products and services in new and existing international markets by expanding our distribution channels through select retailers and strategic partnerships. We also intend to continue to invest across all geographic regions in sales and marketing efforts, including increasing our global advertising efforts, and in infrastructure and personnel to support our international expansion, including establishing additional sales offices globally. Our international expansion efforts have resulted and will continue to result in increased costs and are subject to a variety of risks, including increased competition, uncertain enforcement of our intellectual property rights, more complex distribution logistics, and the complexity of compliance with foreign laws and regulations.\nWe have grown significantly since our inception. The following are financial highlights for 2015, 2014, and 2013:\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,857,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>745,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>271,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(51,622\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>389,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>191,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Devices sold\n</td> <td>21,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee the section titled Selected Financial Data-Adjusted EBITDA\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our use of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss). See the section titled -Key Business Metrics\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding devices sold.\nKey Business Metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts, and make strategic decisions.\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of or For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Devices sold\n</td> <td>21,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Active users\n</td> <td>16,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Registered device users\n</td> <td>29,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>389,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>191,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDevices Sold\nDevices sold represents the number of connected health and fitness devices that are sold during a period, net of expected returns and provisions for the Fitbit Force recall. Devices sold does not include sales of accessories. Growth rates between devices sold and revenue are not necessarily correlated because our revenue is affected by other variables, such as the types of products sold during the period, the introduction of new product offerings that have different U.S. MSRPs, and sales of accessories and premium services.\nActive Users\nWe define an active user as a registered Fitbit user who, within the three months prior to the date of measurement, has (a) an active Fitbit Premium or FitStar subscription, (b) paired a health and fitness tracker or Aria scale with his or her Fitbit account, or (c) logged at least 100 steps with a health and fitness tracker or a weight measurement using an Aria scale. The number of active users is based on subscription and device activity associated with each Fitbit user account and, accordingly, a user with multiple devices synced to his or her Fitbit account is counted as only one active user regardless of the number of devices that such user syncs to the account. The number of active users excludes users who have downloaded our mobile apps without purchasing any of our connected health and fitness devices and users who have downloaded free versions of FitStar but are not subscribers to its paid premium offerings.\nWe believe that the active user metric is an indicator of the size and growth of our community, but currently we do not believe that it has a direct effect on our revenue and operating results since substantially all of our revenue to date has been derived from sales of our connected health and fitness devices. The active user metric is not necessarily an indicator of the actual size and future growth of our user community, who we believe to be the most likely to purchase additional products and services on our platform, such as our subscription-based premium services. Accordingly, the active user metric only represents the potential size or growth of our engaged user community. The active user metric is not a measure of the levels of continuous engagement of our individual users over periods of time and does not track the number of individual users that have become inactive on our platform in a period. Instead, the active user metric, as of any given measurement date, represents an aggregate of both existing and new users who have met the definition of an active user\u201d on one occasion during the previous three months, whether that user became newly active or was an existing active user from a prior period. Accordingly, this metric does not take into account the extent to which\ninactive users are offset by new active users or how long an individual user remains active. Given the recent rapid growth of the number of users on our platform, it may be difficult to discern whether the growth in active users is the result of retaining existing users or adding new users onto our platform.\nTherefore, you should not rely on our active user metric as an indicator of the level of user retention of individual users in the future, continual user engagement or of future payments, nor the potential size and growth of our user community as an indicator for other revenue opportunities, such as subscription-based premium services and our corporate wellness offerings.\nRegistered Device Users\nA user becomes a registered device user on the first day the user: (a) becomes a paid subscriber of Fitbit Premium, (b) becomes a paid subscriber to FitStar or (c) uses a health and fitness tracker or Aria scale with his or her Fitbit account. The user is counted only once on the first day of becoming a registered device user. The number of registered device users excludes users who have only downloaded our mobile apps without pairing a health and fitness tracker or Aria scale and users who have only downloaded free versions of FitStar but are not subscribers to its paid premium offerings.\nWe believe that the registered device user metric is an indicator of the potential size and growth of our paid user community but is not necessarily an indicator of the actual size and future growth of our paid user community. The registered device user metric only reflects users that have historically used our devices or paid for a subscription to our services and it is not necessarily an indicator of future payments by users. The registered device user metric also does not provide information regarding the individual users that no longer pay us, how frequently users pay us, or how long a user remains paying. Furthermore, the registered device user metric is not a measure of the levels of continuous engagement of our individual users over periods of time and does not track the number of individual users that have become inactive on our platform in a period.\nTherefore, you should not rely on our registered device user metric as an indicator of the level of retention of individual users in the future, continual user engagement, future payment by users, nor the potential size and growth of our user community as an indicator for other revenue opportunities, such as subscription-based premium services and our corporate wellness offerings.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude the impact of the Fitbit Force recall, stock-based compensation expense, the revaluation of our redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability, depreciation and intangible assets amortization, change in contingent consideration, interest expense and income tax expense. See the section titled Selected Financial Data-Adjusted EBITDA\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our use of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss).\nFactors Affecting Our Future Performance\nProduct Introductions\nTo date, product introductions have had a significant, positive impact on our operating results due primarily to increases in revenue associated with sales of the new products in the quarters following their introduction. Since the beginning of 2013, we have released six new connected health and fitness devices, including the Fitbit Charge, Fitbit Charge HR, and Fitbit Surge, which were released in the fourth quarter of 2014 and were the primary drivers of our revenue growth in 2015. We announced Fitbit Blaze in January 2016 and Fitbit Alta in February 2016. We expect that the impact of these new product introductions on our revenue will lessen over time and we cannot assure that they will have a similarly positive impact in 2016. Furthermore, new product introductions could also adversely impact the sales of our existing products to retailers and users. New products may also have higher costs associated with them, as was the case for new products introduced in the fourth quarter of 2014, which could adversely affect our margins. In addition, we have incurred higher levels of sales and marketing expenses accompanying each product introduction. In the future, we intend to continue to release new products and enhance our existing products, and we expect that our operating results will be impacted by these releases.\nInternational Expansion\nOur products are sold in 63 countries, and we have experienced significant growth in international sales in recent periods. In 2015, 26% of our revenue, based on ship-to destinations, was from sales outside of the United States. We believe our global opportunity is significant, and to address this opportunity, we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing efforts, distribution channels, and infrastructure and personnel to support our international expansion, including establishing additional sales offices globally. Our growth will depend in part on the adoption and sales of our products and services in international markets. Moreover,\nour international expansion efforts have resulted and will continue to result in increased costs and are subject to a variety of risks, including increased competition, uncertain enforcement of our intellectual property rights, more complex distribution logistics, and the complexity of compliance with foreign laws and regulations.\nCategory Adoption and Market Growth\nConsumer spend on the wearable devices market is growing faster than on any segment in the global consumer electronics market. As a pioneer of this market and a leading connected health and fitness platform, we believe we have contributed significantly to the market's growth. However, our future growth depends in part on the continued consumer adoption of wearable devices as a means to improve health and fitness and the growth of this market.\nCompetition\nThe market for connected health and fitness devices is both evolving and competitive. The connected health and fitness devices category has a multitude of participants including specialized consumer electronics companies such as Garmin, Jawbone, and Misfit, traditional health and fitness companies such as adidas and Under Armour, and traditional watch companies such as Fossil and Movado. In addition, many large, broad-based consumer electronics companies either compete in our market or adjacent markets or have announced plans to do so, including Apple, Google, LG, Microsoft, and Samsung. For example, Apple introduced the Apple Watch smartwatch in 2015, with broad-based functionalities, including some health and fitness tracking capabilities, and has sold a significant volume of its smartwatches since introduction. We also face competition from manufacturers of lower-cost devices, such as Xiaomi and its Mi Band device. In addition, we compete with a wide range of stand-alone health and fitness-related mobile apps that can be purchased or downloaded through mobile app stores.\nWe believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors as a result of our leading market position and global brand, advanced and proprietary sensor technologies, software-driven online dashboard and mobile apps, our motivational and social tools, and our premium software offerings. By offering a broad range of products spanning styles and affordable price points and cross-platform compatibility, we empower a wide range of individuals with different fitness routines and goals that are difficult for other competitors to address.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, we have experienced higher revenue in the fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in large part to seasonal holiday demand. For example, in 2015 and 2014, our fourth quarter represented 38% and 50% of our annual revenue, respectively. We also incur higher sales and marketing expenses during these periods.\nInvesting in Growth\nWe intend to continue to make investments across our business to drive our growth. We intend to continue to invest significant resources in our sales, marketing, advertising, and brand management efforts to drive demand for our products and services globally. We also intend to continue to invest in research and development to enable us to introduce innovative new products and services and enhance existing products and services. We may also make acquisitions to further drive our growth. For example, we acquired FitStar in March 2015 to enhance our software and services offerings through interactive video-based exercise experiences on mobile devices and computers.\nFurthermore, we intend to increase our focus on building relationships with employers and wellness providers. The corporate wellness market for connected health and fitness devices is new and is subject to a variety of challenges, including whether employers will continue to invest in such programs, long sales cycles, and substantial upfront sales costs. In each of 2015, 2014, and 2013, we derived less than 10% of our revenue from our corporate wellness offerings. However, we believe that as healthcare costs continue to rise and as employers continue to seek ways to keep their employees active, engaged, and productive, more employers will implement or enhance their corporate wellness programs. In order to grow our corporate wellness presence, we intend to enhance our corporate wellness offering as well as expand our sales team focused on this market.\nComponents of our Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of our connected health and fitness devices and accessories. We also generate a small portion of our revenue from our subscription-based premium services.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of product costs, including costs of contract manufacturers for production, shipping and handling costs, warranty replacement costs, packaging, costs related to the Fitbit Force recall, fulfillment costs, manufacturing and tooling equipment depreciation, warehousing costs, excess and obsolete inventory write-downs, amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired, and certain allocated costs related to management, facilities, and personnel-related expenses and other expenses associated with supply chain logistics. Personnel-related expenses include salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, and change in contingent consideration.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, consulting and contractor expenses, tooling and prototype materials, and allocated overhead costs.\nSubstantially all of our research and development expenses are related to developing new products and services and improving our existing products and services. To date, research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred, because the period between achieving technological feasibility and the release of products and services for sale has been short and development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to make significant investments in developing new products and services and enhancing existing products and services.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses represent the largest component of our operating expenses and consist primarily of advertising and marketing promotions of our products and services and personnel-related expenses, as well as sales incentives, trade show and event costs, sponsorship costs, consulting and contractor expenses, travel, POP display expenses and related amortization, and allocated overhead costs.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related expenses for our finance, legal, human resources, and administrative personnel, as well as the costs of professional services, any allocated overhead, information technology, amortization of intangible assets acquired, and other administrative expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars due to the anticipated growth of our business and related infrastructure as well as legal, accounting, insurance, investor relations, and other costs associated with becoming a public company.\nChange in contingent consideration. The change in contingent consideration relates to the benefit received from the reversal of a contingent liability incurred in connection with the acquisition of FitStar. See note 15 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net consists of interest expense associated with our debt financing arrangements, amortization of debt issuance costs, and interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net consists of mark-to-market adjustments for the revaluation of our redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability prior to our initial public offering and foreign currency gains and losses.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have statutory tax rates different from those in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to U.S. income, the utilization of foreign tax credits, and changes in tax laws.\nFitbit Force Product Recall\nIn March 2014, we recalled the Fitbit Force after some of our users experienced allergic reactions to adhesives in the wristband. This recall primarily impacted our results for the fourth quarter of 2013, the first quarter of 2014, and the fourth quarter of 2015. We established a reserve for the Fitbit Force recall after considering various factors including cost estimates for customer returns,\nlogistics and handling fees for managing product returns and processing refunds, obsolescence of on-hand inventory, cancellation charges for existing purchase commitments, rework of component inventory with the contract manufacturer, legal fees and settlement costs, and write-offs of tooling and manufacturing equipment.\nThe recall had the following effect on our income (loss) before income taxes:\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reduction of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,112\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(30,607\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incremental (benefit to) cost of revenue\n</td> <td>(5,755\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact on gross profit\n</td> <td>(5,755\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,451\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(81,812\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incremental general and administrative expenses (benefit)\n</td> <td>(4,416\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact on income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(84,650\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2013, incremental cost of revenue related to the recall included charges to the recall reserve of $49.5 million and a write-off of tooling and manufacturing equipment of $1.7 million, which was recognized as incurred. During 2014, general and administrative expenses included legal fees of $2.9 million, which were recognized as incurred, and legal settlement costs of $0.5 million, which were included in the Fitbit Force recall reserve. During 2015, a benefit to legal expenses of $4.4 million was recognized in general and administrative costs, of which $1.2 million was previously included in the Fitbit Force recall reserve. See note 6 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nOperating Results\nThe following tables set forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations for each of the periods presented and as a percentage of our revenue for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of operating results is not necessarily indicative of results for future periods.\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Statements of Operations Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,857,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>745,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>271,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue(2)\n</td> <td>956,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>387,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>210,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>901,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>357,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development(2)\n</td> <td>150,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing(2)\n</td> <td>332,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative(2)\n</td> <td>77,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in contingent consideration\n</td> <td>(7,704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>552,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>199,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>348,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,954\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(1,019\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,222\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,082\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income expense, net\n</td> <td>(59,230\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,934\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,649\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>287,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,685\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>112,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(51,622\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>In March 2014, we recalled the Fitbit Force.

U.S. revenue, based on ship-to destinations, increased $356.5 million, or 173%, from $206.1 million for 2013 to $562.6 million for 2014 and international revenue, based on ship-to destinations, increased by $117.9 million, or 181%, from $65.0 million for 2013 to $182.9 million for 2014.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>387,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>357,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>494\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The Fitbit Force recall resulted in an increase to cost of revenue of $51.2 million and $11.3 million in 2013 and 2014, respectively, a decrease in gross profit of $81.8 million and $19.5 million in 2013 and 2014, respectively, and a decrease of 30 percentage points and 3 percentage points in gross margin in 2013 and 2014, respectively.

Other expense, net, increased $12.3 million, or 337%, from $3.6 million for 2013 to $15.9 million for 2014.

Our effective tax rate was 277.2% and 5.7% for 2013 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense and effective tax rate in 2014 was due to a $51.3 million tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets for accruals, which includes the impact of costs incurred in 2013 in connection with the Fitbit Force recall, and tax credits from prior years. This non-recurring tax benefit is offset by income tax expense on earnings in 2014 and a downward revaluation of our deferred tax assets due to a change in state tax law enacted in 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur operations have been financed primarily through cash flow from operating activities, the net proceeds from the sale of our equity securities, and borrowings under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $535.8 million and marketable securities of $128.6 million.\nIn June 2015, we completed our initial public offering of our Class A common stock. We received net proceeds of $420.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $26.9 million, but before deducting offering expenses of approximately $5.0 million. In November 2015, we completed our follow-on offering of our Class A common stock. We received net proceeds of $84.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $2.6 million, but before deducting offering expenses of approximately $1.2 million.\nApproximately 10% of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our earnings from foreign operations and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States and if U.S. tax has not already been previously accrued, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes in order to repatriate these funds.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and other business initiatives, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.\nCredit Facility\nIn December 2015, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement, or Senior Facility, with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, as administrative agent, collateral agent, and lender, SunTrust Bank as syndication agent, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. and several other lenders to replace our existing asset-based credit facility and cash flow facility. This Senior Facility allows us to borrow up to $250.0 million, including up to $50.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit and up to $25.0 million for swing line loans. Borrowings under the Senior Facility may be drawn as Alternate Base Rate, or ABR, loans or Eurodollar loans, and matures in December 2020. ABR loans bear interest at a variable rate equal to the applicable margin plus the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, and (iii) the Eurodollar rate plus 1.0%, but in any case at a minimum rate of 3.25% per annum. Eurodollar loans bear interest at a variable rate based on the LIBOR rate and Eurodollar reserve requirements, but in any case at a minimum rate of 1.0% per annum.\nWe have the option to repay our borrowings under the Senior Facility without penalty prior to maturity. The Senior Facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including maintaining a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.15:1, and a consolidated leverage ratio of less than 3:1. The Senior Facility also requires us to comply with certain non-financial covenants. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we requested and received a waiver from the lender group to extend the deadline for compliance of a non-financial covenant to March 1, 2016. We expect to remain in compliance with the debt covenants, however, no assurances can be provided that we will continue to remain in compliance with the debt covenants. Our obligations under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Senior Facility.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(170,027\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,185\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,834\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>401,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $109.2 million for 2015 was primarily due to net income of $175.7 million and non-cash adjustments of $44.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $111.1 million. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of the revaluation of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability, stock-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by deferred taxes and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The decrease in net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $231.1 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2015, and a $68.1 million increase in inventories as a result of increased product demand, partially offset by a $195.5 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to growth of expenditures to support general business growth. Our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, calculated as the number of days of revenue represented by the accounts receivable balance as of period end, increased from 48 days as of December 31, 2014 to 56 days as of December 31, 2015 due to higher sales in the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to higher sales at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $18.8 million for 2014 was primarily due to net income of $131.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $102.8 million, and non-cash adjustments of $10.2 million. The decrease in net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $158.8 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of increased product demand, a $61.6 million increase in inventories as a result of a decrease in inventory turnover during 2014 primarily due to increased inventory levels for new products announced in the fourth quarter of 2014, and a $60.5 million decrease in Fitbit Force recall liabilities, partially offset by a $171.5 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other liabilities related to growth of expenditures to support general business growth. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of deferred taxes, partially offset by the revaluation of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $33.2 million for 2013 was primarily due to an increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $64.0 million and non-cash adjustments of $20.8 million, partially offset by a net loss of $51.6 million. The increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $77.9 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other liabilities related to growth of expenditures to support general business growth, and a $72.7 million increase in Fitbit Force recall liabilities, partially offset by a $55.6 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 as a result of increased product demand, and a $47.4 million increase in inventories driven by higher levels of inventory to support demand. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of provisions for inventory obsolescence related to the Fitbit Force recall and the revaluation of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for 2015 of $170.0 million was due to the purchases of marketable securities of $230.9 million, purchases of property and equipment of $30.6 million, and the cash portion of the acquisition of FitStar of $11.0 million, net of cash acquired, partially offset by the sale and maturities of marketable securities of $102.5 million.\nCash used in investing activities for 2014 of $24.2 million was due to $26.5 million used for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by a decrease of $2.3 million in restricted cash related to operating lease obligations.\nCash used in investing activities for 2013 of $9.8 million was due to $7.5 million used for purchases of property and equipment, and a $2.3 million increase in restricted cash related to our operating lease obligations.\nIn March 2015, we acquired FitStar for total consideration of $32.5 million, comprised of $13.3 million of common stock, $11.5 million of cash, and $7.7 million of contingent consideration. We determined the fair market value of the contingent consideration, according to which we would have been obligated to issue additional common stock or pay cash, to be $7.7 million as of the acquisition date. We did not pay any contingent consideration as certain market-based events were not satisfied. We may continue to use cash in the future to acquire businesses and technologies that enhance and expand our product offerings. Due to the nature of these transactions, it is difficult to predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements to complete such transactions. We may be required to raise additional funds to complete future acquisitions.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for 2015 of $401.1 million was primarily related to proceeds from our public stock offerings of $505.3 million and excess tax benefits of $32.1 million from stock compensation, partially offset by net repayments of borrowings of $134.5 million under our credit facilities.\nCash provided by financing activities for 2014 of $119.3 million was primarily related to net borrowings of $119.1 million under our credit facilities.\nCash provided by financing activities for 2013 of $45.2 million primarily consisted of net proceeds of $42.8 million related to the issuance of our convertible preferred stock and net borrowings of $2.2 million under our credit facilities as well as proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options of $0.2 million.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our non-cancelable contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>We lease our facilities under long-term operating leases, which expire at various dates through July 2024.

The aggregate amount of purchase orders open as of December 31, 2015 was approximately $452.4 million. We cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers within short periods of time. We subcontract with other companies to manufacture our products. During the normal course of business, we and our contract manufacturers procure components based upon a forecasted production plan. If we cancel all or part of the orders, we may be liable to our suppliers and contract manufacturers for the cost of the unutilized component orders or components purchased by our contract manufactures.\nThe table above excludes the liability for uncertain tax positions of $22.1 million as of December 31, 2015, due to the uncertainty of when the related tax settlements will become due.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements and do not have any holdings in variable interest entities.\nCritical Accounting Polices and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our\nhistorical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's estimates, assumptions, and judgments.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of our connected health and fitness devices and accessories. We also generate a small portion of our revenue from our subscription-based services. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. We consider delivery of our products to have occurred once title and risk of loss has been transferred. For customers where transfer of risk of loss is at the customer's destination, we use estimates to defer sales at the end of the reporting period based on historical experience of average transit time. We recognize revenue, net of estimated sales returns, sales incentives, discounts, and sales tax. We generally recognize revenue for products sold through retailers and distributors on a sell-in basis.\nWe enter into multiple element arrangements that include hardware, software, and services. The first deliverable is the hardware and firmware essential to the functionality of our connected health and fitness devices delivered at the time of sale. The second deliverable is the software services included with the products, which are provided free of charge and enables users to sync, view, and access real-time data on our online dashboard and mobile apps. The third deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of the device to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified firmware upgrades and features relating to the product's essential firmware. Commencing in the first quarter of 2015, we began accounting for the embedded right as a separate unit of accounting, which is when we believe, through public announcements, we had created an implied obligation to, from time to time, provide future unspecified firmware upgrades and features to the firmware to improve and add new functionality to our health and fitness devices. In addition, we occasionally offer a fourth deliverable in bundled arrangements that allows access to certain subscription-based services related to our FitStar offering.\nWe allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. We use a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value, (ii) third-party evidence, or TPE, and (iii) best estimate of the selling price, or BESP, of selling price. Our process for determining BESP considers multiple factors including consumer behaviors and our internal pricing model and may vary depending upon the facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. BESP for our connected health and fitness devices and unspecified upgrade rights reflect our best estimate of the selling prices if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis and comprises the majority of the arrangement consideration. BESP for upgrade rights currently ranges from $1 to $3. TPE for our online dashboard and mobile apps is currently estimated at $0.99. VSOE for access to FitStar subscription-based services is based on the price charged when sold separately.\nAmounts allocated to the delivered health and fitness devices are recognized at the time of delivery, provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Amounts allocated to our online dashboard and mobile apps and unspecified upgrade rights are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated usage period of approximately eight to thirteen months.\nWe offer our users the ability to purchase subscription-based services, through which our users receive incremental features, including access to a digital personal trainer, in-depth analytics regarding the user's personal metrics, or video-based customized workouts. Amounts paid for subscriptions are deferred and recognized ratably over the service period which is typically one year. Revenue from subscription-based premium services was less than 1% of revenue for all periods presented.\nIn addition, we offer access to software and services to certain customers in the corporate wellness program, which includes distribution capabilities, a real-time dashboard, and support services. We are currently unable to establish VSOE or TPE for the corporate wellness software and services. BESP for the corporate wellness software and services is determined based on our internal pricing model for anticipated renewals for existing customers and pricing for new customers. Revenue allocated to the corporate wellness software and services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated access period of one year, which is the typical service period. Revenue from the corporate wellness software and services was less than 1% of revenue for all periods presented.\nWe account for shipping and handling fees billed to customers as revenue. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected from customers are remitted to governmental authorities, are not included in revenue, and are reflected as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets.\nRights of Return, Stock Rotation Rights, and Price Protection\nWe offer limited rights of return, stock rotation rights, and price protection under various policies and programs with our retailer and distributor customers and end-users. Below is a summary of the general provisions of such policies and programs:\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Certain retailers and distributors are allowed to return products that were originally sold through to an end-user, called open box\u201d returns, and such returns may be made at any time after original sale.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>All purchases through Fitbit.com are covered by a 45-day right of return.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Distributors are allowed stock rotation rights which are limited rights of return of products purchased during a prior period, generally one quarter.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Distributors and retailers are allowed return rights for defective products.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Certain distributors are offered price protection that allows for the right to a partial credit for unsold inventory held by the distributor if we reduce the selling price of a product.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe meet all conditions required to recognize revenue at the time of sale when a right of return exists. For example, our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable at time of sale; the buyer's obligation to pay is not contingent on resale of the product; and we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of future returns. We estimate and record reserves for these policies and programs as a reduction of revenue and accounts receivable. On a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved for future returns is calculated based on historical trends and data specific to each reporting period. We review the actual returns evidenced in prior quarters as a percent of related revenue to determine the historical returns rate. We then apply the historical rate of returns to the current period revenue as a basis for estimating future returns. Through December 31, 2015, actual returns have primarily been open-box returns. In addition, through December 31, 2015, we have had minimal stock rotation or price protection claims. When necessary, we also provide a specific reserve for products in the distribution channel in excess of estimated requirements. This estimate can be affected by the amount of a particular product in the channel, the rate of sell-through, product plans, and other factors. We also consider whether there are circumstances which may result in anticipated returns higher than the historical return rate from direct customers and record an additional reserve as necessary.\nSales Incentives\nWe offer sales incentives such as cooperative advertising and marketing development fund programs, rebates, and other incentives. We record cooperative advertising and marketing development fund programs with customers as a reduction to revenue unless we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange for credits claimed by the customer and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the identifiable benefit received, in which case we will record it as a marketing expense. We recognize a liability with a reduction to revenue for rebates or other incentives based on the estimated amount of rebates or credits that will be claimed by customers.\nInventories\nInventories consist of finished goods and component parts, which are purchased from contract manufacturers and component suppliers. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis. We assess the valuation of inventory and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates of future demand and market conditions.\nProduct Warranty\nWe offer a standard product warranty that our products will operate under normal use for a period of one-year from the date of original purchase, except in the European Union where we provide a two-year warranty. We have the obligation, at our option, to either repair or replace the defective product. At the time revenue is recognized, an estimate of future warranty costs is recorded as a component of cost of revenues. Factors that affect the warranty obligation include product failure rates, service delivery costs incurred in correcting the product failures, and warranty policies. The warranty obligation does not consider historical experience of the Fitbit Force product as a separate reserve has been established for the Fitbit Force recall. Our products are manufactured by contractor manufacturers, and in certain cases, we may have recourse to such contract manufacturers.\nFitbit Force Product Recall\nWe established reserves for the Fitbit Force recall when circumstances giving rise to the recall became known. We considered various factors in estimating the product recall exposure. These include estimates for:\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>refunds and product returns from retailer and distributor customers and end-users, which were charged to revenue and cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>logistics and handling fees for managing product returns and processing refunds, obsolescence of on-hand inventory, cancellation charges for existing purchase commitments and rework of component inventory by our contract\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nmanufacturers, write-offs of tooling and manufacturing equipment, which were charged to cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations; and\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>legal fees and settlement costs, which were charged to general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese factors above are updated and reevaluated each period and the related reserves are adjusted when factors indicate that the recall reserves are either insufficient to cover or exceed the estimated product recall expenses.\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to tangible assets, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is allocated to goodwill. The allocation of the purchase consideration requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired customers, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Consistent with our determination that we have one reporting segment, we have determined that there is one reporting unit and test goodwill for impairment at the entity level. We test goodwill using the two-step process in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. In the first step, we compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit to the fair value based on the fair value of our common stock. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, goodwill is potentially impaired and the second step of the impairment test must be performed. In the second step, we would compare the implied fair value of the goodwill, as defined by ASC 350, to its carrying amount to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any.\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any such impairment charge during the years presented.\nIncome Taxes\nWe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments to determine our expense (benefit) for income taxes and also for deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded against our deferred tax assets. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance.\nThe calculation of our income tax expense involves the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments while taking into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of future tax audits. We have established reserves to address potential exposures related to tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. Although we believe our estimates, assumptions, and judgments to be reasonable, any changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolutions of potential tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe calculation of our deferred tax asset balance involves the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments while taking into account estimates of the amounts and type of future taxable income. Actual future operating results and the underlying amount and type of income could differ materially from our estimates, assumptions, and judgments, thereby impacting our financial position and operating results.\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits have been recognized in the appropriate periods presented.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment. The fair value of restricted stock units, or RSUs, is the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and shares issued under our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or 2015 ESPP. The determination of the grant date fair value of stock options and shares issued under our 2015 ESPP using an option-pricing model is affected by our estimated common stock fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables. These variables include the fair value of our common stock, our expected common stock price volatility over the expected life of the options, expected term of the stock option, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends, which are estimated as follows:\nFair Value of Our Common Stock. Prior to our initial public offering, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying stock options was historically established by our board of directors, which was responsible for these estimates, and was based in part upon a valuation provided by an independent third-party valuation firm. Because there was no public market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering, our board of directors considered this independent valuation and other factors, including, but not limited to, revenue growth, the current status of the technical and commercial success of our operations, our financial condition, the stage of our development, and competition to establish the fair value of our common stock at the time of grant of the option. The fair value of the underlying common stock was determined by the board of directors until our common stock was listed on a stock exchange. For stock options and RSUs granted subsequent to our initial public offering, the fair value was based on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term represents the period over which we anticipate stock-based awards to be outstanding. We do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time stock-based awards have been exercisable. As a result, for stock options, we used the simplified method to calculate the expected term estimate based on the vesting and contractual terms of the option. Under the simplified method, the expected term is equal to the average of the stock-based award's weighted average vesting period and its contractual term. The expected term of equity awards issued under our 2015 ESPP is the contractual term.\nVolatility. Expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which the stock price is expected to fluctuate. We estimate the expected volatility of the common stock underlying our stock options and equity awards issued under our 2015 ESPP at the grant date by taking the average historical volatility of the common stock of a group of comparable publicly traded companies over a period equal to the expected life. We use this method because we have limited information on the volatility of our Class A common stock because of our short trading history.\nRisk-Free Rate. The risk-free interest rate is estimated average interest rate based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon notes with terms consistent with the expected term of the awards.\nDividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.\nIn addition, we are required to estimate the amount of stock-based compensation we expect to be forfeited based on our historical experience. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the stock-based awards represent management judgment. As a result, if factors change and different assumptions are used, the stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, or ASU 2014-09, regarding Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This ASU affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods and services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance when it becomes effective. The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the currently effective guidance. These\nmay include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the standard. ASU 2014-09 will become effective for us on January 1, 2018 and can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. Early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date of annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This ASU requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. We early adopted this accounting standard retrospectively in our fourth quarter of 2015 and reclassified all our current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This ASU requires lease assets and lease liabilities arising from leases, including operating leases, to be recognized on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 will become effective for us on January 1, 2019, and requires adoption using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed above in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Report.\nOverview\nOur mission is to help people lead healthier, more active lives by empowering them with data, inspiration, and guidance to reach their goals.\nFitbit is transforming the way millions of people around the world achieve their health and fitness goals. The Fitbit platform combines connected health and fitness devices with software and services, including an online dashboard and mobile apps, data analytics, motivational and social tools, personalized insights, and virtual coaching through customized fitness plans and interactive workouts. Our platform helps people become more active, exercise more, sleep better, eat smarter, and manage their weight. Fitbit appeals to a large, mainstream health and fitness market by addressing these key needs with advanced technology embedded in simple-to-use products and services. We pioneered the connected health and fitness market starting in 2007, and since then, we have grown into a leading global health and fitness brand.\nThe core of our platform is our family of eight wearable connected health and fitness trackers. These wrist-based and clippable\u201d devices automatically track users' daily steps, calories burned, distance traveled, and active minutes and display real-time feedback to encourage them to become more active in their daily lives. Most of our trackers also measure floors climbed, sleep duration and quality, and our more advanced products track heart rate and GPS-based information such as speed, distance, and exercise routes. Several of our devices also feature deeper integration with smartphones, such as the ability to receive call and text notifications and control music. In addition, we offer a Wi-Fi connected scale that records weight, body fat, and BMI. We are able to enhance the functionality and features of our connected devices through wireless updates. Our platform also includes our online dashboard and mobile apps, which wirelessly and automatically sync with our devices. Our platform allows our users to see trends and achievements, access motivational tools such as virtual badges and real-time progress notifications, and connect, support, and compete with friends and family. We intend to continue to significantly invest in research and development in order to enhance our products and services.\nWe design our products primarily in California and outsource the production of our devices to contract manufacturers, which are responsible for procuring most of the components used in the manufacturing of our products from third-party suppliers. We also outsource packaging and fulfillment to third-party logistics providers around the world.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from sales of our connected health and fitness devices. We sell our products in over 50,000 retail stores and in 63 countries, through our retailers' websites, through our online store at Fitbit.com, and as part of our corporate wellness offering. We seek to build global brand awareness, increase product adoption, and drive sales through our sales and marketing efforts. We intend to continue to significantly invest in these sales and marketing efforts in the future.\nOur growth will depend in part on the adoption and sale of our products and services in international markets. In recent periods, we have experienced significant growth in international sales. In 2015, 26% of our revenue, based on ship-to destinations, was from sales outside of the United States. We believe international markets represent a significant growth opportunity for us. We intend to expand sales of our products and services in new and existing international markets by expanding our distribution channels through select retailers and strategic partnerships. We also intend to continue to invest across all geographic regions in sales and marketing efforts, including increasing our global advertising efforts, and in infrastructure and personnel to support our international expansion, including establishing additional sales offices globally. Our international expansion efforts have resulted and will continue to result in increased costs and are subject to a variety of risks, including increased competition, uncertain enforcement of our intellectual property rights, more complex distribution logistics, and the complexity of compliance with foreign laws and regulations.\nWe have grown significantly since our inception. The following are financial highlights for 2015, 2014, and 2013:\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,857,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>745,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>271,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(51,622\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>389,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>191,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Devices sold\n</td> <td>21,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee the section titled Selected Financial Data-Adjusted EBITDA\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our use of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss). See the section titled -Key Business Metrics\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding devices sold.\nKey Business Metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts, and make strategic decisions.\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of or For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Devices sold\n</td> <td>21,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Active users\n</td> <td>16,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Registered device users\n</td> <td>29,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>389,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>191,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDevices Sold\nDevices sold represents the number of connected health and fitness devices that are sold during a period, net of expected returns and provisions for the Fitbit Force recall. Devices sold does not include sales of accessories. Growth rates between devices sold and revenue are not necessarily correlated because our revenue is affected by other variables, such as the types of products sold during the period, the introduction of new product offerings that have different U.S. MSRPs, and sales of accessories and premium services.\nActive Users\nWe define an active user as a registered Fitbit user who, within the three months prior to the date of measurement, has (a) an active Fitbit Premium or FitStar subscription, (b) paired a health and fitness tracker or Aria scale with his or her Fitbit account, or (c) logged at least 100 steps with a health and fitness tracker or a weight measurement using an Aria scale. The number of active users is based on subscription and device activity associated with each Fitbit user account and, accordingly, a user with multiple devices synced to his or her Fitbit account is counted as only one active user regardless of the number of devices that such user syncs to the account. The number of active users excludes users who have downloaded our mobile apps without purchasing any of our connected health and fitness devices and users who have downloaded free versions of FitStar but are not subscribers to its paid premium offerings.\nWe believe that the active user metric is an indicator of the size and growth of our community, but currently we do not believe that it has a direct effect on our revenue and operating results since substantially all of our revenue to date has been derived from sales of our connected health and fitness devices. The active user metric is not necessarily an indicator of the actual size and future growth of our user community, who we believe to be the most likely to purchase additional products and services on our platform, such as our subscription-based premium services. Accordingly, the active user metric only represents the potential size or growth of our engaged user community. The active user metric is not a measure of the levels of continuous engagement of our individual users over periods of time and does not track the number of individual users that have become inactive on our platform in a period. Instead, the active user metric, as of any given measurement date, represents an aggregate of both existing and new users who have met the definition of an active user\u201d on one occasion during the previous three months, whether that user became newly active or was an existing active user from a prior period. Accordingly, this metric does not take into account the extent to which\ninactive users are offset by new active users or how long an individual user remains active. Given the recent rapid growth of the number of users on our platform, it may be difficult to discern whether the growth in active users is the result of retaining existing users or adding new users onto our platform.\nTherefore, you should not rely on our active user metric as an indicator of the level of user retention of individual users in the future, continual user engagement or of future payments, nor the potential size and growth of our user community as an indicator for other revenue opportunities, such as subscription-based premium services and our corporate wellness offerings.\nRegistered Device Users\nA user becomes a registered device user on the first day the user: (a) becomes a paid subscriber of Fitbit Premium, (b) becomes a paid subscriber to FitStar or (c) uses a health and fitness tracker or Aria scale with his or her Fitbit account. The user is counted only once on the first day of becoming a registered device user. The number of registered device users excludes users who have only downloaded our mobile apps without pairing a health and fitness tracker or Aria scale and users who have only downloaded free versions of FitStar but are not subscribers to its paid premium offerings.\nWe believe that the registered device user metric is an indicator of the potential size and growth of our paid user community but is not necessarily an indicator of the actual size and future growth of our paid user community. The registered device user metric only reflects users that have historically used our devices or paid for a subscription to our services and it is not necessarily an indicator of future payments by users. The registered device user metric also does not provide information regarding the individual users that no longer pay us, how frequently users pay us, or how long a user remains paying. Furthermore, the registered device user metric is not a measure of the levels of continuous engagement of our individual users over periods of time and does not track the number of individual users that have become inactive on our platform in a period.\nTherefore, you should not rely on our registered device user metric as an indicator of the level of retention of individual users in the future, continual user engagement, future payment by users, nor the potential size and growth of our user community as an indicator for other revenue opportunities, such as subscription-based premium services and our corporate wellness offerings.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude the impact of the Fitbit Force recall, stock-based compensation expense, the revaluation of our redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability, depreciation and intangible assets amortization, change in contingent consideration, interest expense and income tax expense. See the section titled Selected Financial Data-Adjusted EBITDA\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our use of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss).\nFactors Affecting Our Future Performance\nProduct Introductions\nTo date, product introductions have had a significant, positive impact on our operating results due primarily to increases in revenue associated with sales of the new products in the quarters following their introduction. Since the beginning of 2013, we have released six new connected health and fitness devices, including the Fitbit Charge, Fitbit Charge HR, and Fitbit Surge, which were released in the fourth quarter of 2014 and were the primary drivers of our revenue growth in 2015. We announced Fitbit Blaze in January 2016 and Fitbit Alta in February 2016. We expect that the impact of these new product introductions on our revenue will lessen over time and we cannot assure that they will have a similarly positive impact in 2016. Furthermore, new product introductions could also adversely impact the sales of our existing products to retailers and users. New products may also have higher costs associated with them, as was the case for new products introduced in the fourth quarter of 2014, which could adversely affect our margins. In addition, we have incurred higher levels of sales and marketing expenses accompanying each product introduction. In the future, we intend to continue to release new products and enhance our existing products, and we expect that our operating results will be impacted by these releases.\nInternational Expansion\nOur products are sold in 63 countries, and we have experienced significant growth in international sales in recent periods. In 2015, 26% of our revenue, based on ship-to destinations, was from sales outside of the United States. We believe our global opportunity is significant, and to address this opportunity, we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing efforts, distribution channels, and infrastructure and personnel to support our international expansion, including establishing additional sales offices globally. Our growth will depend in part on the adoption and sales of our products and services in international markets. Moreover,\nour international expansion efforts have resulted and will continue to result in increased costs and are subject to a variety of risks, including increased competition, uncertain enforcement of our intellectual property rights, more complex distribution logistics, and the complexity of compliance with foreign laws and regulations.\nCategory Adoption and Market Growth\nConsumer spend on the wearable devices market is growing faster than on any segment in the global consumer electronics market. As a pioneer of this market and a leading connected health and fitness platform, we believe we have contributed significantly to the market's growth. However, our future growth depends in part on the continued consumer adoption of wearable devices as a means to improve health and fitness and the growth of this market.\nCompetition\nThe market for connected health and fitness devices is both evolving and competitive. The connected health and fitness devices category has a multitude of participants including specialized consumer electronics companies such as Garmin, Jawbone, and Misfit, traditional health and fitness companies such as adidas and Under Armour, and traditional watch companies such as Fossil and Movado. In addition, many large, broad-based consumer electronics companies either compete in our market or adjacent markets or have announced plans to do so, including Apple, Google, LG, Microsoft, and Samsung. For example, Apple introduced the Apple Watch smartwatch in 2015, with broad-based functionalities, including some health and fitness tracking capabilities, and has sold a significant volume of its smartwatches since introduction. We also face competition from manufacturers of lower-cost devices, such as Xiaomi and its Mi Band device. In addition, we compete with a wide range of stand-alone health and fitness-related mobile apps that can be purchased or downloaded through mobile app stores.\nWe believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors as a result of our leading market position and global brand, advanced and proprietary sensor technologies, software-driven online dashboard and mobile apps, our motivational and social tools, and our premium software offerings. By offering a broad range of products spanning styles and affordable price points and cross-platform compatibility, we empower a wide range of individuals with different fitness routines and goals that are difficult for other competitors to address.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, we have experienced higher revenue in the fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in large part to seasonal holiday demand. For example, in 2015 and 2014, our fourth quarter represented 38% and 50% of our annual revenue, respectively. We also incur higher sales and marketing expenses during these periods.\nInvesting in Growth\nWe intend to continue to make investments across our business to drive our growth. We intend to continue to invest significant resources in our sales, marketing, advertising, and brand management efforts to drive demand for our products and services globally. We also intend to continue to invest in research and development to enable us to introduce innovative new products and services and enhance existing products and services. We may also make acquisitions to further drive our growth. For example, we acquired FitStar in March 2015 to enhance our software and services offerings through interactive video-based exercise experiences on mobile devices and computers.\nFurthermore, we intend to increase our focus on building relationships with employers and wellness providers. The corporate wellness market for connected health and fitness devices is new and is subject to a variety of challenges, including whether employers will continue to invest in such programs, long sales cycles, and substantial upfront sales costs. In each of 2015, 2014, and 2013, we derived less than 10% of our revenue from our corporate wellness offerings. However, we believe that as healthcare costs continue to rise and as employers continue to seek ways to keep their employees active, engaged, and productive, more employers will implement or enhance their corporate wellness programs. In order to grow our corporate wellness presence, we intend to enhance our corporate wellness offering as well as expand our sales team focused on this market.\nComponents of our Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of our connected health and fitness devices and accessories. We also generate a small portion of our revenue from our subscription-based premium services.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of product costs, including costs of contract manufacturers for production, shipping and handling costs, warranty replacement costs, packaging, costs related to the Fitbit Force recall, fulfillment costs, manufacturing and tooling equipment depreciation, warehousing costs, excess and obsolete inventory write-downs, amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired, and certain allocated costs related to management, facilities, and personnel-related expenses and other expenses associated with supply chain logistics. Personnel-related expenses include salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, and change in contingent consideration.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, consulting and contractor expenses, tooling and prototype materials, and allocated overhead costs.\nSubstantially all of our research and development expenses are related to developing new products and services and improving our existing products and services. To date, research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred, because the period between achieving technological feasibility and the release of products and services for sale has been short and development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to make significant investments in developing new products and services and enhancing existing products and services.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses represent the largest component of our operating expenses and consist primarily of advertising and marketing promotions of our products and services and personnel-related expenses, as well as sales incentives, trade show and event costs, sponsorship costs, consulting and contractor expenses, travel, POP display expenses and related amortization, and allocated overhead costs.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related expenses for our finance, legal, human resources, and administrative personnel, as well as the costs of professional services, any allocated overhead, information technology, amortization of intangible assets acquired, and other administrative expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars due to the anticipated growth of our business and related infrastructure as well as legal, accounting, insurance, investor relations, and other costs associated with becoming a public company.\nChange in contingent consideration. The change in contingent consideration relates to the benefit received from the reversal of a contingent liability incurred in connection with the acquisition of FitStar. See note 15 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net consists of interest expense associated with our debt financing arrangements, amortization of debt issuance costs, and interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net consists of mark-to-market adjustments for the revaluation of our redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability prior to our initial public offering and foreign currency gains and losses.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have statutory tax rates different from those in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to U.S. income, the utilization of foreign tax credits, and changes in tax laws.\nFitbit Force Product Recall\nIn March 2014, we recalled the Fitbit Force after some of our users experienced allergic reactions to adhesives in the wristband. This recall primarily impacted our results for the fourth quarter of 2013, the first quarter of 2014, and the fourth quarter of 2015. We established a reserve for the Fitbit Force recall after considering various factors including cost estimates for customer returns,\nlogistics and handling fees for managing product returns and processing refunds, obsolescence of on-hand inventory, cancellation charges for existing purchase commitments, rework of component inventory with the contract manufacturer, legal fees and settlement costs, and write-offs of tooling and manufacturing equipment.\nThe recall had the following effect on our income (loss) before income taxes:\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reduction of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,112\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(30,607\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incremental (benefit to) cost of revenue\n</td> <td>(5,755\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact on gross profit\n</td> <td>(5,755\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,451\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(81,812\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incremental general and administrative expenses (benefit)\n</td> <td>(4,416\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact on income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(84,650\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2013, incremental cost of revenue related to the recall included charges to the recall reserve of $49.5 million and a write-off of tooling and manufacturing equipment of $1.7 million, which was recognized as incurred. During 2014, general and administrative expenses included legal fees of $2.9 million, which were recognized as incurred, and legal settlement costs of $0.5 million, which were included in the Fitbit Force recall reserve. During 2015, a benefit to legal expenses of $4.4 million was recognized in general and administrative costs, of which $1.2 million was previously included in the Fitbit Force recall reserve.

A substantial majority of the increase was due to an increase in the number of devices sold from 10.9 million in 2014 to 21.4 million in 2015, including $1,427 million in revenue in 2015 from new products introduced in the fourth quarter of 2014.

The increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of devices sold and an increase in average cost per device related to new products introduced in the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, we recognized a $5.8 million benefit to cost of revenue for 2015 compared to an $11.3 million increase to cost of revenue for 2014 in connection with the recall of the Fitbit Force.\nGross margin was 48% for both 2015 and 2014. Gross margin for 2015 was primarily affected by the aforementioned impact of lower margins on new products introduced in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on product pricing, offset by a reduction in costs incurred in connection with the recall of the Fitbit Force and to a lesser extent, reduced estimated costs of warranty claims.\nResearch and Development\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses increased $95.9 million, or 177%, from $54.2 million for 2014 to $150.0 million for 2015.

This non-recurring tax benefit is offset by income tax expense on earnings in 2014 and a downward revaluation of our deferred tax assets due to a change in state tax law enacted in 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur operations have been financed primarily through cash flow from operating activities, the net proceeds from the sale of our equity securities, and borrowings under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $535.8 million and marketable securities of $128.6 million.\nIn June 2015, we completed our initial public offering of our Class A common stock. We received net proceeds of $420.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $26.9 million, but before deducting offering expenses of approximately $5.0 million. In November 2015, we completed our follow-on offering of our Class A common stock. We received net proceeds of $84.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $2.6 million, but before deducting offering expenses of approximately $1.2 million.\nApproximately 10% of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our earnings from foreign operations and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States and if U.S. tax has not already been previously accrued, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes in order to repatriate these funds.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and other business initiatives, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.\nCredit Facility\nIn December 2015, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement, or Senior Facility, with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, as administrative agent, collateral agent, and lender, SunTrust Bank as syndication agent, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. and several other lenders to replace our existing asset-based credit facility and cash flow facility. This Senior Facility allows us to borrow up to $250.0 million, including up to $50.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit and up to $25.0 million for swing line loans. Borrowings under the Senior Facility may be drawn as Alternate Base Rate, or ABR, loans or Eurodollar loans, and matures in December 2020. ABR loans bear interest at a variable rate equal to the applicable margin plus the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, and (iii) the Eurodollar rate plus 1.0%, but in any case at a minimum rate of 3.25% per annum. Eurodollar loans bear interest at a variable rate based on the LIBOR rate and Eurodollar reserve requirements, but in any case at a minimum rate of 1.0% per annum.\nWe have the option to repay our borrowings under the Senior Facility without penalty prior to maturity. The Senior Facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including maintaining a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.15:1, and a consolidated leverage ratio of less than 3:1. The Senior Facility also requires us to comply with certain non-financial covenants. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we requested and received a waiver from the lender group to extend the deadline for compliance of a non-financial covenant to March 1, 2016. We expect to remain in compliance with the debt covenants, however, no assurances can be provided that we will continue to remain in compliance with the debt covenants. Our obligations under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Senior Facility.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(170,027\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,185\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,834\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>401,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $109.2 million for 2015 was primarily due to net income of $175.7 million and non-cash adjustments of $44.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $111.1 million. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of the revaluation of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability, stock-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by deferred taxes and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The decrease in net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $231.1 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2015, and a $68.1 million increase in inventories as a result of increased product demand, partially offset by a $195.5 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to growth of expenditures to support general business growth. Our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, calculated as the number of days of revenue represented by the accounts receivable balance as of period end, increased from 48 days as of December 31, 2014 to 56 days as of December 31, 2015 due to higher sales in the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to higher sales at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $18.8 million for 2014 was primarily due to net income of $131.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $102.8 million, and non-cash adjustments of $10.2 million. The decrease in net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $158.8 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of increased product demand, a $61.6 million increase in inventories as a result of a decrease in inventory turnover during 2014 primarily due to increased inventory levels for new products announced in the fourth quarter of 2014, and a $60.5 million decrease in Fitbit Force recall liabilities, partially offset by a $171.5 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other liabilities related to growth of expenditures to support general business growth. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of deferred taxes, partially offset by the revaluation of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $33.2 million for 2013 was primarily due to an increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $64.0 million and non-cash adjustments of $20.8 million, partially offset by a net loss of $51.6 million. The increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $77.9 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other liabilities related to growth of expenditures to support general business growth, and a $72.7 million increase in Fitbit Force recall liabilities, partially offset by a $55.6 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 as a result of increased product demand, and a $47.4 million increase in inventories driven by higher levels of inventory to support demand. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of provisions for inventory obsolescence related to the Fitbit Force recall and the revaluation of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for 2015 of $170.0 million was due to the purchases of marketable securities of $230.9 million, purchases of property and equipment of $30.6 million, and the cash portion of the acquisition of FitStar of $11.0 million, net of cash acquired, partially offset by the sale and maturities of marketable securities of $102.5 million.\nCash used in investing activities for 2014 of $24.2 million was due to $26.5 million used for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by a decrease of $2.3 million in restricted cash related to operating lease obligations.\nCash used in investing activities for 2013 of $9.8 million was due to $7.5 million used for purchases of property and equipment, and a $2.3 million increase in restricted cash related to our operating lease obligations.\nIn March 2015, we acquired FitStar for total consideration of $32.5 million, comprised of $13.3 million of common stock, $11.5 million of cash, and $7.7 million of contingent consideration. We determined the fair market value of the contingent consideration, according to which we would have been obligated to issue additional common stock or pay cash, to be $7.7 million as of the acquisition date. We did not pay any contingent consideration as certain market-based events were not satisfied. We may continue to use cash in the future to acquire businesses and technologies that enhance and expand our product offerings. Due to the nature of these transactions, it is difficult to predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements to complete such transactions. We may be required to raise additional funds to complete future acquisitions.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for 2015 of $401.1 million was primarily related to proceeds from our public stock offerings of $505.3 million and excess tax benefits of $32.1 million from stock compensation, partially offset by net repayments of borrowings of $134.5 million under our credit facilities.\nCash provided by financing activities for 2014 of $119.3 million was primarily related to net borrowings of $119.1 million under our credit facilities.\nCash provided by financing activities for 2013 of $45.2 million primarily consisted of net proceeds of $42.8 million related to the issuance of our convertible preferred stock and net borrowings of $2.2 million under our credit facilities as well as proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options of $0.2 million.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our non-cancelable contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) We lease our facilities under long-term operating leases, which expire at various dates through July 2024. The lease agreements frequently include provisions which require us to pay taxes, insurance, or maintenance costs. \nPurchase orders or contracts for the purchase of certain goods and services are not included in the preceding table. The aggregate amount of purchase orders open as of December 31, 2015 was approximately $452.4 million. We cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers within short periods of time. We subcontract with other companies to manufacture our products. During the normal course of business, we and our contract manufacturers procure components based upon a forecasted production plan. If we cancel all or part of the orders, we may be liable to our suppliers and contract manufacturers for the cost of the unutilized component orders or components purchased by our contract manufactures.\nThe table above excludes the liability for uncertain tax positions of $22.1 million as of December 31, 2015, due to the uncertainty of when the related tax settlements will become due.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements and do not have any holdings in variable interest entities.\nCritical Accounting Polices and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our\nhistorical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's estimates, assumptions, and judgments.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of our connected health and fitness devices and accessories. We also generate a small portion of our revenue from our subscription-based services. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. We consider delivery of our products to have occurred once title and risk of loss has been transferred. For customers where transfer of risk of loss is at the customer's destination, we use estimates to defer sales at the end of the reporting period based on historical experience of average transit time. We recognize revenue, net of estimated sales returns, sales incentives, discounts, and sales tax. We generally recognize revenue for products sold through retailers and distributors on a sell-in basis.\nWe enter into multiple element arrangements that include hardware, software, and services. The first deliverable is the hardware and firmware essential to the functionality of our connected health and fitness devices delivered at the time of sale. The second deliverable is the software services included with the products, which are provided free of charge and enables users to sync, view, and access real-time data on our online dashboard and mobile apps. The third deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of the device to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified firmware upgrades and features relating to the product's essential firmware. Commencing in the first quarter of 2015, we began accounting for the embedded right as a separate unit of accounting, which is when we believe, through public announcements, we had created an implied obligation to, from time to time, provide future unspecified firmware upgrades and features to the firmware to improve and add new functionality to our health and fitness devices. In addition, we occasionally offer a fourth deliverable in bundled arrangements that allows access to certain subscription-based services related to our FitStar offering.\nWe allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. We use a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value, (ii) third-party evidence, or TPE, and (iii) best estimate of the selling price, or BESP, of selling price. Our process for determining BESP considers multiple factors including consumer behaviors and our internal pricing model and may vary depending upon the facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. BESP for our connected health and fitness devices and unspecified upgrade rights reflect our best estimate of the selling prices if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis and comprises the majority of the arrangement consideration. BESP for upgrade rights currently ranges from $1 to $3. TPE for our online dashboard and mobile apps is currently estimated at $0.99. VSOE for access to FitStar subscription-based services is based on the price charged when sold separately.\nAmounts allocated to the delivered health and fitness devices are recognized at the time of delivery, provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Amounts allocated to our online dashboard and mobile apps and unspecified upgrade rights are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated usage period of approximately eight to thirteen months.\nWe offer our users the ability to purchase subscription-based services, through which our users receive incremental features, including access to a digital personal trainer, in-depth analytics regarding the user's personal metrics, or video-based customized workouts. Amounts paid for subscriptions are deferred and recognized ratably over the service period which is typically one year. Revenue from subscription-based premium services was less than 1% of revenue for all periods presented.\nIn addition, we offer access to software and services to certain customers in the corporate wellness program, which includes distribution capabilities, a real-time dashboard, and support services. We are currently unable to establish VSOE or TPE for the corporate wellness software and services. BESP for the corporate wellness software and services is determined based on our internal pricing model for anticipated renewals for existing customers and pricing for new customers. Revenue allocated to the corporate wellness software and services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated access period of one year, which is the typical service period. Revenue from the corporate wellness software and services was less than 1% of revenue for all periods presented.\nWe account for shipping and handling fees billed to customers as revenue. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected from customers are remitted to governmental authorities, are not included in revenue, and are reflected as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets.\nRights of Return, Stock Rotation Rights, and Price Protection\nWe offer limited rights of return, stock rotation rights, and price protection under various policies and programs with our retailer and distributor customers and end-users. Below is a summary of the general provisions of such policies and programs:\n \u2022 Certain retailers and distributors are allowed to return products that were originally sold through to an end-user, called open box\u201d returns, and such returns may be made at any time after original sale. \n \u2022 All purchases through Fitbit.com are covered by a 45-day right of return. \n \u2022 Distributors are allowed stock rotation rights which are limited rights of return of products purchased during a prior period, generally one quarter. \n \u2022 Distributors and retailers are allowed return rights for defective products. \n \u2022 Certain distributors are offered price protection that allows for the right to a partial credit for unsold inventory held by the distributor if we reduce the selling price of a product. \nWe meet all conditions required to recognize revenue at the time of sale when a right of return exists. For example, our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable at time of sale; the buyer's obligation to pay is not contingent on resale of the product; and we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of future returns. We estimate and record reserves for these policies and programs as a reduction of revenue and accounts receivable. On a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved for future returns is calculated based on historical trends and data specific to each reporting period. We review the actual returns evidenced in prior quarters as a percent of related revenue to determine the historical returns rate. We then apply the historical rate of returns to the current period revenue as a basis for estimating future returns. Through December 31, 2015, actual returns have primarily been open-box returns. In addition, through December 31, 2015, we have had minimal stock rotation or price protection claims. When necessary, we also provide a specific reserve for products in the distribution channel in excess of estimated requirements. This estimate can be affected by the amount of a particular product in the channel, the rate of sell-through, product plans, and other factors. We also consider whether there are circumstances which may result in anticipated returns higher than the historical return rate from direct customers and record an additional reserve as necessary.\nSales Incentives\nWe offer sales incentives such as cooperative advertising and marketing development fund programs, rebates, and other incentives. We record cooperative advertising and marketing development fund programs with customers as a reduction to revenue unless we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange for credits claimed by the customer and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the identifiable benefit received, in which case we will record it as a marketing expense. We recognize a liability with a reduction to revenue for rebates or other incentives based on the estimated amount of rebates or credits that will be claimed by customers.\nInventories\nInventories consist of finished goods and component parts, which are purchased from contract manufacturers and component suppliers. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis. We assess the valuation of inventory and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates of future demand and market conditions.\nProduct Warranty\nWe offer a standard product warranty that our products will operate under normal use for a period of one-year from the date of original purchase, except in the European Union where we provide a two-year warranty. We have the obligation, at our option, to either repair or replace the defective product. At the time revenue is recognized, an estimate of future warranty costs is recorded as a component of cost of revenues. Factors that affect the warranty obligation include product failure rates, service delivery costs incurred in correcting the product failures, and warranty policies. The warranty obligation does not consider historical experience of the Fitbit Force product as a separate reserve has been established for the Fitbit Force recall. Our products are manufactured by contractor manufacturers, and in certain cases, we may have recourse to such contract manufacturers.\nFitbit Force Product Recall\nWe established reserves for the Fitbit Force recall when circumstances giving rise to the recall became known. We considered various factors in estimating the product recall exposure. These include estimates for:\n \u2022 refunds and product returns from retailer and distributor customers and end-users, which were charged to revenue and cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations; \n \u2022 logistics and handling fees for managing product returns and processing refunds, obsolescence of on-hand inventory, cancellation charges for existing purchase commitments and rework of component inventory by our contract \nmanufacturers, write-offs of tooling and manufacturing equipment, which were charged to cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations; and\n \u2022 legal fees and settlement costs, which were charged to general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. \nThese factors above are updated and reevaluated each period and the related reserves are adjusted when factors indicate that the recall reserves are either insufficient to cover or exceed the estimated product recall expenses.\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to tangible assets, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is allocated to goodwill. The allocation of the purchase consideration requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired customers, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Consistent with our determination that we have one reporting segment, we have determined that there is one reporting unit and test goodwill for impairment at the entity level. We test goodwill using the two-step process in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. In the first step, we compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit to the fair value based on the fair value of our common stock. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, goodwill is potentially impaired and the second step of the impairment test must be performed. In the second step, we would compare the implied fair value of the goodwill, as defined by ASC 350, to its carrying amount to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any.\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any such impairment charge during the years presented.\nIncome Taxes\nWe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments to determine our expense (benefit) for income taxes and also for deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded against our deferred tax assets. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance.\nThe calculation of our income tax expense involves the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments while taking into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of future tax audits. We have established reserves to address potential exposures related to tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. Although we believe our estimates, assumptions, and judgments to be reasonable, any changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolutions of potential tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe calculation of our deferred tax asset balance involves the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments while taking into account estimates of the amounts and type of future taxable income. Actual future operating results and the underlying amount and type of income could differ materially from our estimates, assumptions, and judgments, thereby impacting our financial position and operating results.\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits have been recognized in the appropriate periods presented.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment. The fair value of restricted stock units, or RSUs, is the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and shares issued under our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or 2015 ESPP. The determination of the grant date fair value of stock options and shares issued under our 2015 ESPP using an option-pricing model is affected by our estimated common stock fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables. These variables include the fair value of our common stock, our expected common stock price volatility over the expected life of the options, expected term of the stock option, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends, which are estimated as follows:\nFair Value of Our Common Stock. Prior to our initial public offering, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying stock options was historically established by our board of directors, which was responsible for these estimates, and was based in part upon a valuation provided by an independent third-party valuation firm. Because there was no public market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering, our board of directors considered this independent valuation and other factors, including, but not limited to, revenue growth, the current status of the technical and commercial success of our operations, our financial condition, the stage of our development, and competition to establish the fair value of our common stock at the time of grant of the option. The fair value of the underlying common stock was determined by the board of directors until our common stock was listed on a stock exchange. For stock options and RSUs granted subsequent to our initial public offering, the fair value was based on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term represents the period over which we anticipate stock-based awards to be outstanding. We do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time stock-based awards have been exercisable. As a result, for stock options, we used the simplified method to calculate the expected term estimate based on the vesting and contractual terms of the option. Under the simplified method, the expected term is equal to the average of the stock-based award's weighted average vesting period and its contractual term. The expected term of equity awards issued under our 2015 ESPP is the contractual term.\nVolatility. Expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which the stock price is expected to fluctuate. We estimate the expected volatility of the common stock underlying our stock options and equity awards issued under our 2015 ESPP at the grant date by taking the average historical volatility of the common stock of a group of comparable publicly traded companies over a period equal to the expected life. We use this method because we have limited information on the volatility of our Class A common stock because of our short trading history.\nRisk-Free Rate. The risk-free interest rate is estimated average interest rate based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon notes with terms consistent with the expected term of the awards.\nDividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.\nIn addition, we are required to estimate the amount of stock-based compensation we expect to be forfeited based on our historical experience. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the stock-based awards represent management judgment. As a result, if factors change and different assumptions are used, the stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, or ASU 2014-09, regarding Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This ASU affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods and services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance when it becomes effective. The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the currently effective guidance. These\nmay include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the standard. ASU 2014-09 will become effective for us on January 1, 2018 and can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. Early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date of annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This ASU requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. We early adopted this accounting standard retrospectively in our fourth quarter of 2015 and reclassified all our current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This ASU requires lease assets and lease liabilities arising from leases, including operating leases, to be recognized on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 will become effective for us on January 1, 2019, and requires adoption using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed above in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Report.\nOverview\nOur mission is to help people lead healthier, more active lives by empowering them with data, inspiration, and guidance to reach their goals.\nFitbit is transforming the way millions of people around the world achieve their health and fitness goals. The Fitbit platform combines connected health and fitness devices with software and services, including an online dashboard and mobile apps, data analytics, motivational and social tools, personalized insights, and virtual coaching through customized fitness plans and interactive workouts. Our platform helps people become more active, exercise more, sleep better, eat smarter, and manage their weight. Fitbit appeals to a large, mainstream health and fitness market by addressing these key needs with advanced technology embedded in simple-to-use products and services. We pioneered the connected health and fitness market starting in 2007, and since then, we have grown into a leading global health and fitness brand.\nThe core of our platform is our family of eight wearable connected health and fitness trackers. These wrist-based and clippable\u201d devices automatically track users' daily steps, calories burned, distance traveled, and active minutes and display real-time feedback to encourage them to become more active in their daily lives. Most of our trackers also measure floors climbed, sleep duration and quality, and our more advanced products track heart rate and GPS-based information such as speed, distance, and exercise routes. Several of our devices also feature deeper integration with smartphones, such as the ability to receive call and text notifications and control music. In addition, we offer a Wi-Fi connected scale that records weight, body fat, and BMI. We are able to enhance the functionality and features of our connected devices through wireless updates. Our platform also includes our online dashboard and mobile apps, which wirelessly and automatically sync with our devices. Our platform allows our users to see trends and achievements, access motivational tools such as virtual badges and real-time progress notifications, and connect, support, and compete with friends and family. We intend to continue to significantly invest in research and development in order to enhance our products and services.\nWe design our products primarily in California and outsource the production of our devices to contract manufacturers, which are responsible for procuring most of the components used in the manufacturing of our products from third-party suppliers. We also outsource packaging and fulfillment to third-party logistics providers around the world.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from sales of our connected health and fitness devices. We sell our products in over 50,000 retail stores and in 63 countries, through our retailers' websites, through our online store at Fitbit.com, and as part of our corporate wellness offering. We seek to build global brand awareness, increase product adoption, and drive sales through our sales and marketing efforts. We intend to continue to significantly invest in these sales and marketing efforts in the future.\nOur growth will depend in part on the adoption and sale of our products and services in international markets. In recent periods, we have experienced significant growth in international sales. In 2015, 26% of our revenue, based on ship-to destinations, was from sales outside of the United States. We believe international markets represent a significant growth opportunity for us. We intend to expand sales of our products and services in new and existing international markets by expanding our distribution channels through select retailers and strategic partnerships. We also intend to continue to invest across all geographic regions in sales and marketing efforts, including increasing our global advertising efforts, and in infrastructure and personnel to support our international expansion, including establishing additional sales offices globally. Our international expansion efforts have resulted and will continue to result in increased costs and are subject to a variety of risks, including increased competition, uncertain enforcement of our intellectual property rights, more complex distribution logistics, and the complexity of compliance with foreign laws and regulations.\nWe have grown significantly since our inception. The following are financial highlights for 2015, 2014, and 2013:\n\nSee the section titled Selected Financial Data-Adjusted EBITDA\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our use of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss). See the section titled -Key Business Metrics\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding devices sold.\nKey Business Metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts, and make strategic decisions.\n\nDevices Sold\nDevices sold represents the number of connected health and fitness devices that are sold during a period, net of expected returns and provisions for the Fitbit Force recall. Devices sold does not include sales of accessories. Growth rates between devices sold and revenue are not necessarily correlated because our revenue is affected by other variables, such as the types of products sold during the period, the introduction of new product offerings that have different U.S. MSRPs, and sales of accessories and premium services.\nActive Users\nWe define an active user as a registered Fitbit user who, within the three months prior to the date of measurement, has (a) an active Fitbit Premium or FitStar subscription, (b) paired a health and fitness tracker or Aria scale with his or her Fitbit account, or (c) logged at least 100 steps with a health and fitness tracker or a weight measurement using an Aria scale. The number of active users is based on subscription and device activity associated with each Fitbit user account and, accordingly, a user with multiple devices synced to his or her Fitbit account is counted as only one active user regardless of the number of devices that such user syncs to the account. The number of active users excludes users who have downloaded our mobile apps without purchasing any of our connected health and fitness devices and users who have downloaded free versions of FitStar but are not subscribers to its paid premium offerings.\nWe believe that the active user metric is an indicator of the size and growth of our community, but currently we do not believe that it has a direct effect on our revenue and operating results since substantially all of our revenue to date has been derived from sales of our connected health and fitness devices. The active user metric is not necessarily an indicator of the actual size and future growth of our user community, who we believe to be the most likely to purchase additional products and services on our platform, such as our subscription-based premium services. Accordingly, the active user metric only represents the potential size or growth of our engaged user community. The active user metric is not a measure of the levels of continuous engagement of our individual users over periods of time and does not track the number of individual users that have become inactive on our platform in a period. Instead, the active user metric, as of any given measurement date, represents an aggregate of both existing and new users who have met the definition of an active user\u201d on one occasion during the previous three months, whether that user became newly active or was an existing active user from a prior period. Accordingly, this metric does not take into account the extent to which\ninactive users are offset by new active users or how long an individual user remains active. Given the recent rapid growth of the number of users on our platform, it may be difficult to discern whether the growth in active users is the result of retaining existing users or adding new users onto our platform.\nTherefore, you should not rely on our active user metric as an indicator of the level of user retention of individual users in the future, continual user engagement or of future payments, nor the potential size and growth of our user community as an indicator for other revenue opportunities, such as subscription-based premium services and our corporate wellness offerings.\nRegistered Device Users\nA user becomes a registered device user on the first day the user: (a) becomes a paid subscriber of Fitbit Premium, (b) becomes a paid subscriber to FitStar or (c) uses a health and fitness tracker or Aria scale with his or her Fitbit account. The user is counted only once on the first day of becoming a registered device user. The number of registered device users excludes users who have only downloaded our mobile apps without pairing a health and fitness tracker or Aria scale and users who have only downloaded free versions of FitStar but are not subscribers to its paid premium offerings.\nWe believe that the registered device user metric is an indicator of the potential size and growth of our paid user community but is not necessarily an indicator of the actual size and future growth of our paid user community. The registered device user metric only reflects users that have historically used our devices or paid for a subscription to our services and it is not necessarily an indicator of future payments by users. The registered device user metric also does not provide information regarding the individual users that no longer pay us, how frequently users pay us, or how long a user remains paying. Furthermore, the registered device user metric is not a measure of the levels of continuous engagement of our individual users over periods of time and does not track the number of individual users that have become inactive on our platform in a period.\nTherefore, you should not rely on our registered device user metric as an indicator of the level of retention of individual users in the future, continual user engagement, future payment by users, nor the potential size and growth of our user community as an indicator for other revenue opportunities, such as subscription-based premium services and our corporate wellness offerings.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude the impact of the Fitbit Force recall, stock-based compensation expense, the revaluation of our redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability, depreciation and intangible assets amortization, change in contingent consideration, interest expense and income tax expense. See the section titled Selected Financial Data-Adjusted EBITDA\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our use of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss).\nFactors Affecting Our Future Performance\nProduct Introductions\nTo date, product introductions have had a significant, positive impact on our operating results due primarily to increases in revenue associated with sales of the new products in the quarters following their introduction. Since the beginning of 2013, we have released six new connected health and fitness devices, including the Fitbit Charge, Fitbit Charge HR, and Fitbit Surge, which were released in the fourth quarter of 2014 and were the primary drivers of our revenue growth in 2015. We announced Fitbit Blaze in January 2016 and Fitbit Alta in February 2016. We expect that the impact of these new product introductions on our revenue will lessen over time and we cannot assure that they will have a similarly positive impact in 2016. Furthermore, new product introductions could also adversely impact the sales of our existing products to retailers and users. New products may also have higher costs associated with them, as was the case for new products introduced in the fourth quarter of 2014, which could adversely affect our margins. In addition, we have incurred higher levels of sales and marketing expenses accompanying each product introduction. In the future, we intend to continue to release new products and enhance our existing products, and we expect that our operating results will be impacted by these releases.\nInternational Expansion\nOur products are sold in 63 countries, and we have experienced significant growth in international sales in recent periods. In 2015, 26% of our revenue, based on ship-to destinations, was from sales outside of the United States. We believe our global opportunity is significant, and to address this opportunity, we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing efforts, distribution channels, and infrastructure and personnel to support our international expansion, including establishing additional sales offices globally. Our growth will depend in part on the adoption and sales of our products and services in international markets. Moreover,\nour international expansion efforts have resulted and will continue to result in increased costs and are subject to a variety of risks, including increased competition, uncertain enforcement of our intellectual property rights, more complex distribution logistics, and the complexity of compliance with foreign laws and regulations.\nCategory Adoption and Market Growth\nConsumer spend on the wearable devices market is growing faster than on any segment in the global consumer electronics market. As a pioneer of this market and a leading connected health and fitness platform, we believe we have contributed significantly to the market's growth. However, our future growth depends in part on the continued consumer adoption of wearable devices as a means to improve health and fitness and the growth of this market.\nCompetition\nThe market for connected health and fitness devices is both evolving and competitive. The connected health and fitness devices category has a multitude of participants including specialized consumer electronics companies such as Garmin, Jawbone, and Misfit, traditional health and fitness companies such as adidas and Under Armour, and traditional watch companies such as Fossil and Movado. In addition, many large, broad-based consumer electronics companies either compete in our market or adjacent markets or have announced plans to do so, including Apple, Google, LG, Microsoft, and Samsung. For example, Apple introduced the Apple Watch smartwatch in 2015, with broad-based functionalities, including some health and fitness tracking capabilities, and has sold a significant volume of its smartwatches since introduction. We also face competition from manufacturers of lower-cost devices, such as Xiaomi and its Mi Band device. In addition, we compete with a wide range of stand-alone health and fitness-related mobile apps that can be purchased or downloaded through mobile app stores.\nWe believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors as a result of our leading market position and global brand, advanced and proprietary sensor technologies, software-driven online dashboard and mobile apps, our motivational and social tools, and our premium software offerings. By offering a broad range of products spanning styles and affordable price points and cross-platform compatibility, we empower a wide range of individuals with different fitness routines and goals that are difficult for other competitors to address.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, we have experienced higher revenue in the fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in large part to seasonal holiday demand. For example, in 2015 and 2014, our fourth quarter represented 38% and 50% of our annual revenue, respectively. We also incur higher sales and marketing expenses during these periods.\nInvesting in Growth\nWe intend to continue to make investments across our business to drive our growth. We intend to continue to invest significant resources in our sales, marketing, advertising, and brand management efforts to drive demand for our products and services globally. We also intend to continue to invest in research and development to enable us to introduce innovative new products and services and enhance existing products and services. We may also make acquisitions to further drive our growth. For example, we acquired FitStar in March 2015 to enhance our software and services offerings through interactive video-based exercise experiences on mobile devices and computers.\nFurthermore, we intend to increase our focus on building relationships with employers and wellness providers. The corporate wellness market for connected health and fitness devices is new and is subject to a variety of challenges, including whether employers will continue to invest in such programs, long sales cycles, and substantial upfront sales costs. In each of 2015, 2014, and 2013, we derived less than 10% of our revenue from our corporate wellness offerings. However, we believe that as healthcare costs continue to rise and as employers continue to seek ways to keep their employees active, engaged, and productive, more employers will implement or enhance their corporate wellness programs. In order to grow our corporate wellness presence, we intend to enhance our corporate wellness offering as well as expand our sales team focused on this market.\nComponents of our Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of our connected health and fitness devices and accessories. We also generate a small portion of our revenue from our subscription-based premium services.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of product costs, including costs of contract manufacturers for production, shipping and handling costs, warranty replacement costs, packaging, costs related to the Fitbit Force recall, fulfillment costs, manufacturing and tooling equipment depreciation, warehousing costs, excess and obsolete inventory write-downs, amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired, and certain allocated costs related to management, facilities, and personnel-related expenses and other expenses associated with supply chain logistics. Personnel-related expenses include salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, and change in contingent consideration.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, consulting and contractor expenses, tooling and prototype materials, and allocated overhead costs.\nSubstantially all of our research and development expenses are related to developing new products and services and improving our existing products and services. To date, research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred, because the period between achieving technological feasibility and the release of products and services for sale has been short and development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to make significant investments in developing new products and services and enhancing existing products and services.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses represent the largest component of our operating expenses and consist primarily of advertising and marketing promotions of our products and services and personnel-related expenses, as well as sales incentives, trade show and event costs, sponsorship costs, consulting and contractor expenses, travel, POP display expenses and related amortization, and allocated overhead costs.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related expenses for our finance, legal, human resources, and administrative personnel, as well as the costs of professional services, any allocated overhead, information technology, amortization of intangible assets acquired, and other administrative expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars due to the anticipated growth of our business and related infrastructure as well as legal, accounting, insurance, investor relations, and other costs associated with becoming a public company.\nChange in contingent consideration. The change in contingent consideration relates to the benefit received from the reversal of a contingent liability incurred in connection with the acquisition of FitStar. See note 15 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net consists of interest expense associated with our debt financing arrangements, amortization of debt issuance costs, and interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net consists of mark-to-market adjustments for the revaluation of our redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability prior to our initial public offering and foreign currency gains and losses.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have statutory tax rates different from those in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to U.S. income, the utilization of foreign tax credits, and changes in tax laws.\nFitbit Force Product Recall\nIn March 2014, we recalled the Fitbit Force after some of our users experienced allergic reactions to adhesives in the wristband. This recall primarily impacted our results for the fourth quarter of 2013, the first quarter of 2014, and the fourth quarter of 2015. We established a reserve for the Fitbit Force recall after considering various factors including cost estimates for customer returns,\nlogistics and handling fees for managing product returns and processing refunds, obsolescence of on-hand inventory, cancellation charges for existing purchase commitments, rework of component inventory with the contract manufacturer, legal fees and settlement costs, and write-offs of tooling and manufacturing equipment.\nThe recall had the following effect on our income (loss) before income taxes:\n\nDuring 2013, incremental cost of revenue related to the recall included charges to the recall reserve of $49.5 million and a write-off of tooling and manufacturing equipment of $1.7 million, which was recognized as incurred. During 2014, general and administrative expenses included legal fees of $2.9 million, which were recognized as incurred, and legal settlement costs of $0.5 million, which were included in the Fitbit Force recall reserve. During 2015, a benefit to legal expenses of $4.4 million was recognized in general and administrative costs, of which $1.2 million was previously included in the Fitbit Force recall reserve. See note 6 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nOperating Results\nThe following tables set forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations for each of the periods presented and as a percentage of our revenue for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of operating results is not necessarily indicative of results for future periods.\n\n (1) In March 2014, we recalled the Fitbit Force. See the section titled -Fitbit Force Product Recall\u201d for additional information. The recall, which primarily affected our results for the fourth quarter of 2013, the first quarter of 2014, and the fourth quarter of 2015 and had the following effect on our income (loss) before income taxes: \n\n (2) Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows: \n\n\n (1) In March 2014, we recalled the Fitbit Force. See the section titled -Fitbit Force Product Recall\u201d for additional information. The recall, which primarily affected our results for the fourth quarter of 2013, the first quarter of 2014, and the fourth quarter of 2015 and had the following effect on our income (loss) before income taxes: \n\nComparison of 2015 and 2014\nRevenue\n\n (1) The Fitbit Force recall resulted in a decrease to revenue of $8.1 million for 2014. See the section titled -Fitbit Force Product Recall\u201d for additional information. \nRevenue increased $1,113 million, or 149%, from $745.4 million for 2014 to $1,858 million for 2015. A substantial majority of the increase was due to an increase in the number of devices sold from 10.9 million in 2014 to 21.4 million in 2015, including $1,427 million in revenue in 2015 from new products introduced in the fourth quarter of 2014. Revenue also increased due to an increase in the average selling price of our devices by 29% from $66 per device for 2014 to $85 per device for 2015, due to new products introduced in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase in revenue includes the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $56.3 million, net of the impact of foreign currency hedges. U.S. revenue, based on ship-to destinations, increased $818.6 million, or 146%, from $562.5 million for 2014 to $1,381.1 million 2015, and international revenue, based on ship-to destinations, increased by $293.9 million, or 161%, from $182.9 million for 2014 to $476.8 million for 2015.\nCost of Revenue\n\n (1) The Fitbit Force recall resulted in a benefit to cost of revenue of $5.8 million and an increase to cost of revenue of $11.3 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase in gross profit of $5.8 million and a decrease in gross profit of $19.5 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, and a negligible increase in gross margin and a decrease in gross margin of 3 percentage points for 2015 and 2014, respectively. See the section titled -Fitbit Force Product Recall\u201d for additional information. \nCost of revenue increased $569.2 million, or 147%, from $387.8 million for 2014 to $956.9 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of devices sold and an increase in average cost per device related to new products introduced in the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, we recognized a $5.8 million benefit to cost of revenue for 2015 compared to an $11.3 million increase to cost of revenue for 2014 in connection with the recall of the Fitbit Force.\nGross margin was 48% for both 2015 and 2014. Gross margin for 2015 was primarily affected by the aforementioned impact of lower margins on new products introduced in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on product pricing, offset by a reduction in costs incurred in connection with the recall of the Fitbit Force and to a lesser extent, reduced estimated costs of warranty claims.\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses increased $95.9 million, or 177%, from $54.2 million for 2014 to $150.0 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $64.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to a 176% increase in headcount, a $14.5 million increase in consultant and contractor expenses, a $6.8 million increase in tooling and prototype materials, a $5.3 million increase in allocated overhead, and a $2.2 million increase in travel expenses.\nWe expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue to increase in 2016.\nSales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing expenses increased $220.7 million, or 197%, from $112.0 million for 2014 to $332.7 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $178.2 million increase in expenses associated with advertising costs and other marketing programs, driven by the launch of media campaigns during 2015. In addition, consulting and contractor expenses increased $21.2 million, and personnel-related expenses increased $20.0 million due to a 96% increase in headcount.\nWe expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue to increase from or remain relatively consistent in 2016 from 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\n (1) The Fitbit Force recall resulted in a benefit to general and administrative expenses of $4.4 million and an increase to general and administrative expenses of $3.4 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. See the section titled -Fitbit Force Product Recall\u201d for additional information. \nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $44.2 million, or 132%, from $33.6 million for 2014 to $77.8 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $23.8 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to a 141% increase in headcount, an $8.7 million increase in consulting and contractor expenses, a $7.8 million increase in other administrative expenses and taxes, a $0.9 million increase in recruiting expenses, a $0.8 million increase in allocated overhead, and a $0.7 million increase in legal fees. The $0.7 million increase in legal fees is net of a benefit of $4.4 million related to the Fitbit Force recall.\nWe expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2016 to be relatively consistent with 2015.\nChange in Contingent Consideration\n\nThe change in contingent consideration benefit of $7.7 million for 2015 is a result of our re-measurement of the contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of FitStar. This is a non-recurring benefit. There was no contingent liability as of December 31, 2015 as the terms of the contingent consideration have expired.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\n\nInterest expense, net decreased $1.2 million, or 54%, from $2.2 million for 2014 to $1.0 million for 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in 2015 in average indebtedness outstanding compared to 2014. Other expense, net, increased $43.3 million, from $15.9 million for 2014 to $59.2 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $43.4 million in charges related to the revaluation of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability from $13.3 million for 2014 to $56.7 million for 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense\n\nIncome tax expense increased $104.3 million from $8.0 million for 2014 to $112.3 million for 2015. Our effective tax rate was 39.0% and 5.7% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in income tax expense and effective tax rate for 2015 was primarily due to increased earnings during this period. The low effective tax rate in 2014 was due to a $51.3 million tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to accruals, which includes the impact of costs incurred in 2013 in connection with the Fitbit Force recall, and tax credits from prior years. This non-recurring tax benefit is offset by income tax expense on earnings in 2014 and a downward revaluation of our deferred tax assets due to a change in state tax law enacted in 2014.\nComparison of 2014 and 2013\nRevenue\n\n (1) The Fitbit Force recall resulted in a decrease to revenue of $30.6 million and $8.1 million in 2013 and 2014, respectively. See the section titled -Fitbit Force Product Recall\u201d for additional information. \nRevenue increased $474.3 million, or 175%, from $271.1 million for 2013 to $745.4 million for 2014. A substantial majority of the increase was due to an increase in the number of devices sold from 4.5 million in 2013 to 10.9 million in 2014, including $151.9 million from new products that we began selling in 2014. U.S. revenue, based on ship-to destinations, increased $356.5 million, or 173%, from $206.1 million for 2013 to $562.6 million for 2014 and international revenue, based on ship-to destinations, increased by $117.9 million, or 181%, from $65.0 million for 2013 to $182.9 million for 2014.\nCost of Revenue\n\n (1) The Fitbit Force recall resulted in an increase to cost of revenue of $51.2 million and $11.3 million in 2013 and 2014, respectively, a decrease in gross profit of $81.8 million and $19.5 million in 2013 and 2014, respectively, and a decrease of 30 percentage points and 3 percentage points in gross margin in 2013 and 2014, respectively. See the section titled -Fitbit Force Product Recall\u201d for additional information. \nCost of revenue increased $176.9 million, or 84%, from $210.8 million for 2013 to $387.8 million for 2014. The increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of devices sold, partially offset by a decrease of $39.9 million in costs, from $51.2 million in 2013 to $11.3 million in 2014, incurred in connection with the recall of the Fitbit Force.\nGross margin increased to 48% for 2014 from 22% for 2013. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a reduction in costs incurred in connection with the recall of the Fitbit Force.\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses increased $26.3 million, or 94%, from $27.9 million for 2013 to $54.2 million for 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $13.9 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to a 110% increase in headcount, a $12.9 million increase in consultant and contractor expenses, and a $3.6 million increase in allocated overhead, which was partially offset by a decrease in expenses for tooling and prototype materials of $4.2 million.\nSales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing expenses increased $85.2 million, or 317%, from $26.8 million for 2013 to $112.0 million for 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $66.9 million increase in expenses associated with advertising costs and other marketing programs. In addition, consulting and contractor expenses increased $9.6 million and personnel-related expenses increased $9.3 million due to a 131% increase in headcount, partially offset by a decrease of $0.6 million of other expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\n (1) The Fitbit Force recall resulted in an increase to general and administrative expenses of $2.8 million and $3.4 million in 2013 and 2014, respectively. See the section titled -Fitbit Force Product Recall\u201d for additional information. \nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $19.1 million, or 132%, from $14.5 million for 2013 to $33.6 million for 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $6.8 million increase in legal fees, a $5.7 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to a 64% increase in headcount, a $2.2 million increase in allocated overhead, and a $2.7 million increase in consulting and contractor expenses.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nInterest expense, net increased $1.1 million, or 105%, from $1.1 million for 2013 to $2.2 million for 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in 2014 in average indebtedness outstanding compared to 2013. Other expense, net, increased $12.3 million, or 337%, from $3.6 million for 2013 to $15.9 million for 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $9.9 million in charges related to the revaluation of our redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability and a $2.5 million increase in foreign exchange loss.\nIncome Tax Expense\n\nIncome tax expense decreased $29.9 million, or 79%, from $37.9 million for 2013 to $8.0 million for 2014. Our effective tax rate was 277.2% and 5.7% for 2013 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense and effective tax rate in 2014 was due to a $51.3 million tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets for accruals, which includes the impact of costs incurred in 2013 in connection with the Fitbit Force recall, and tax credits from prior years. This non-recurring tax benefit is offset by income tax expense on earnings in 2014 and a downward revaluation of our deferred tax assets due to a change in state tax law enacted in 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur operations have been financed primarily through cash flow from operating activities, the net proceeds from the sale of our equity securities, and borrowings under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $535.8 million and marketable securities of $128.6 million.\nIn June 2015, we completed our initial public offering of our Class A common stock. We received net proceeds of $420.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $26.9 million, but before deducting offering expenses of approximately $5.0 million. In November 2015, we completed our follow-on offering of our Class A common stock. We received net proceeds of $84.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $2.6 million, but before deducting offering expenses of approximately $1.2 million.\nApproximately 10% of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our earnings from foreign operations and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States and if U.S. tax has not already been previously accrued, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes in order to repatriate these funds.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and other business initiatives, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.\nCredit Facility\nIn December 2015, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement, or Senior Facility, with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, as administrative agent, collateral agent, and lender, SunTrust Bank as syndication agent, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. and several other lenders to replace our existing asset-based credit facility and cash flow facility. This Senior Facility allows us to borrow up to $250.0 million, including up to $50.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit and up to $25.0 million for swing line loans. Borrowings under the Senior Facility may be drawn as Alternate Base Rate, or ABR, loans or Eurodollar loans, and matures in December 2020. ABR loans bear interest at a variable rate equal to the applicable margin plus the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, and (iii) the Eurodollar rate plus 1.0%, but in any case at a minimum rate of 3.25% per annum. Eurodollar loans bear interest at a variable rate based on the LIBOR rate and Eurodollar reserve requirements, but in any case at a minimum rate of 1.0% per annum.\nWe have the option to repay our borrowings under the Senior Facility without penalty prior to maturity. The Senior Facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including maintaining a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.15:1, and a consolidated leverage ratio of less than 3:1. The Senior Facility also requires us to comply with certain non-financial covenants. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we requested and received a waiver from the lender group to extend the deadline for compliance of a non-financial covenant to March 1, 2016. We expect to remain in compliance with the debt covenants, however, no assurances can be provided that we will continue to remain in compliance with the debt covenants. Our obligations under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Senior Facility.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $109.2 million for 2015 was primarily due to net income of $175.7 million and non-cash adjustments of $44.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $111.1 million. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of the revaluation of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability, stock-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by deferred taxes and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The decrease in net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $231.1 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2015, and a $68.1 million increase in inventories as a result of increased product demand, partially offset by a $195.5 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to growth of expenditures to support general business growth. Our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, calculated as the number of days of revenue represented by the accounts receivable balance as of period end, increased from 48 days as of December 31, 2014 to 56 days as of December 31, 2015 due to higher sales in the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to higher sales at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $18.8 million for 2014 was primarily due to net income of $131.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $102.8 million, and non-cash adjustments of $10.2 million. The decrease in net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $158.8 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of increased product demand, a $61.6 million increase in inventories as a result of a decrease in inventory turnover during 2014 primarily due to increased inventory levels for new products announced in the fourth quarter of 2014, and a $60.5 million decrease in Fitbit Force recall liabilities, partially offset by a $171.5 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other liabilities related to growth of expenditures to support general business growth. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of deferred taxes, partially offset by the revaluation of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $33.2 million for 2013 was primarily due to an increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $64.0 million and non-cash adjustments of $20.8 million, partially offset by a net loss of $51.6 million. The increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $77.9 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other liabilities related to growth of expenditures to support general business growth, and a $72.7 million increase in Fitbit Force recall liabilities, partially offset by a $55.6 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 as a result of increased product demand, and a $47.4 million increase in inventories driven by higher levels of inventory to support demand. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of provisions for inventory obsolescence related to the Fitbit Force recall and the revaluation of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for 2015 of $170.0 million was due to the purchases of marketable securities of $230.9 million, purchases of property and equipment of $30.6 million, and the cash portion of the acquisition of FitStar of $11.0 million, net of cash acquired, partially offset by the sale and maturities of marketable securities of $102.5 million.\nCash used in investing activities for 2014 of $24.2 million was due to $26.5 million used for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by a decrease of $2.3 million in restricted cash related to operating lease obligations.\nCash used in investing activities for 2013 of $9.8 million was due to $7.5 million used for purchases of property and equipment, and a $2.3 million increase in restricted cash related to our operating lease obligations.\nIn March 2015, we acquired FitStar for total consideration of $32.5 million, comprised of $13.3 million of common stock, $11.5 million of cash, and $7.7 million of contingent consideration. We determined the fair market value of the contingent consideration, according to which we would have been obligated to issue additional common stock or pay cash, to be $7.7 million as of the acquisition date. We did not pay any contingent consideration as certain market-based events were not satisfied. We may continue to use cash in the future to acquire businesses and technologies that enhance and expand our product offerings. Due to the nature of these transactions, it is difficult to predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements to complete such transactions. We may be required to raise additional funds to complete future acquisitions.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for 2015 of $401.1 million was primarily related to proceeds from our public stock offerings of $505.3 million and excess tax benefits of $32.1 million from stock compensation, partially offset by net repayments of borrowings of $134.5 million under our credit facilities.\nCash provided by financing activities for 2014 of $119.3 million was primarily related to net borrowings of $119.1 million under our credit facilities.\nCash provided by financing activities for 2013 of $45.2 million primarily consisted of net proceeds of $42.8 million related to the issuance of our convertible preferred stock and net borrowings of $2.2 million under our credit facilities as well as proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options of $0.2 million.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our non-cancelable contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\n\n (1) We lease our facilities under long-term operating leases, which expire at various dates through July 2024. The lease agreements frequently include provisions which require us to pay taxes, insurance, or maintenance costs. \nPurchase orders or contracts for the purchase of certain goods and services are not included in the preceding table. The aggregate amount of purchase orders open as of December 31, 2015 was approximately $452.4 million. We cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers within short periods of time. We subcontract with other companies to manufacture our products. During the normal course of business, we and our contract manufacturers procure components based upon a forecasted production plan. If we cancel all or part of the orders, we may be liable to our suppliers and contract manufacturers for the cost of the unutilized component orders or components purchased by our contract manufactures.\nThe table above excludes the liability for uncertain tax positions of $22.1 million as of December 31, 2015, due to the uncertainty of when the related tax settlements will become due.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements and do not have any holdings in variable interest entities.\nCritical Accounting Polices and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our\nhistorical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's estimates, assumptions, and judgments.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of our connected health and fitness devices and accessories. We also generate a small portion of our revenue from our subscription-based services. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. We consider delivery of our products to have occurred once title and risk of loss has been transferred. For customers where transfer of risk of loss is at the customer's destination, we use estimates to defer sales at the end of the reporting period based on historical experience of average transit time. We recognize revenue, net of estimated sales returns, sales incentives, discounts, and sales tax. We generally recognize revenue for products sold through retailers and distributors on a sell-in basis.\nWe enter into multiple element arrangements that include hardware, software, and services. The first deliverable is the hardware and firmware essential to the functionality of our connected health and fitness devices delivered at the time of sale. The second deliverable is the software services included with the products, which are provided free of charge and enables users to sync, view, and access real-time data on our online dashboard and mobile apps. The third deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of the device to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified firmware upgrades and features relating to the product's essential firmware. Commencing in the first quarter of 2015, we began accounting for the embedded right as a separate unit of accounting, which is when we believe, through public announcements, we had created an implied obligation to, from time to time, provide future unspecified firmware upgrades and features to the firmware to improve and add new functionality to our health and fitness devices. In addition, we occasionally offer a fourth deliverable in bundled arrangements that allows access to certain subscription-based services related to our FitStar offering.\nWe allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. We use a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value, (ii) third-party evidence, or TPE, and (iii) best estimate of the selling price, or BESP, of selling price. Our process for determining BESP considers multiple factors including consumer behaviors and our internal pricing model and may vary depending upon the facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. BESP for our connected health and fitness devices and unspecified upgrade rights reflect our best estimate of the selling prices if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis and comprises the majority of the arrangement consideration. BESP for upgrade rights currently ranges from $1 to $3. TPE for our online dashboard and mobile apps is currently estimated at $0.99. VSOE for access to FitStar subscription-based services is based on the price charged when sold separately.\nAmounts allocated to the delivered health and fitness devices are recognized at the time of delivery, provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Amounts allocated to our online dashboard and mobile apps and unspecified upgrade rights are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated usage period of approximately eight to thirteen months.\nWe offer our users the ability to purchase subscription-based services, through which our users receive incremental features, including access to a digital personal trainer, in-depth analytics regarding the user's personal metrics, or video-based customized workouts. Amounts paid for subscriptions are deferred and recognized ratably over the service period which is typically one year. Revenue from subscription-based premium services was less than 1% of revenue for all periods presented.\nIn addition, we offer access to software and services to certain customers in the corporate wellness program, which includes distribution capabilities, a real-time dashboard, and support services. We are currently unable to establish VSOE or TPE for the corporate wellness software and services. BESP for the corporate wellness software and services is determined based on our internal pricing model for anticipated renewals for existing customers and pricing for new customers. Revenue allocated to the corporate wellness software and services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated access period of one year, which is the typical service period. Revenue from the corporate wellness software and services was less than 1% of revenue for all periods presented.\nWe account for shipping and handling fees billed to customers as revenue. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected from customers are remitted to governmental authorities, are not included in revenue, and are reflected as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets.\nRights of Return, Stock Rotation Rights, and Price Protection\nWe offer limited rights of return, stock rotation rights, and price protection under various policies and programs with our retailer and distributor customers and end-users. Below is a summary of the general provisions of such policies and programs:\n \u2022 Certain retailers and distributors are allowed to return products that were originally sold through to an end-user, called open box\u201d returns, and such returns may be made at any time after original sale. \n \u2022 All purchases through Fitbit.com are covered by a 45-day right of return. \n \u2022 Distributors are allowed stock rotation rights which are limited rights of return of products purchased during a prior period, generally one quarter. \n \u2022 Distributors and retailers are allowed return rights for defective products. \n \u2022 Certain distributors are offered price protection that allows for the right to a partial credit for unsold inventory held by the distributor if we reduce the selling price of a product. \nWe meet all conditions required to recognize revenue at the time of sale when a right of return exists. For example, our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable at time of sale; the buyer's obligation to pay is not contingent on resale of the product; and we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of future returns. We estimate and record reserves for these policies and programs as a reduction of revenue and accounts receivable. On a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved for future returns is calculated based on historical trends and data specific to each reporting period. We review the actual returns evidenced in prior quarters as a percent of related revenue to determine the historical returns rate. We then apply the historical rate of returns to the current period revenue as a basis for estimating future returns. Through December 31, 2015, actual returns have primarily been open-box returns. In addition, through December 31, 2015, we have had minimal stock rotation or price protection claims. When necessary, we also provide a specific reserve for products in the distribution channel in excess of estimated requirements. This estimate can be affected by the amount of a particular product in the channel, the rate of sell-through, product plans, and other factors. We also consider whether there are circumstances which may result in anticipated returns higher than the historical return rate from direct customers and record an additional reserve as necessary.\nSales Incentives\nWe offer sales incentives such as cooperative advertising and marketing development fund programs, rebates, and other incentives. We record cooperative advertising and marketing development fund programs with customers as a reduction to revenue unless we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange for credits claimed by the customer and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the identifiable benefit received, in which case we will record it as a marketing expense. We recognize a liability with a reduction to revenue for rebates or other incentives based on the estimated amount of rebates or credits that will be claimed by customers.\nInventories\nInventories consist of finished goods and component parts, which are purchased from contract manufacturers and component suppliers. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis. We assess the valuation of inventory and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates of future demand and market conditions.\nProduct Warranty\nWe offer a standard product warranty that our products will operate under normal use for a period of one-year from the date of original purchase, except in the European Union where we provide a two-year warranty. We have the obligation, at our option, to either repair or replace the defective product. At the time revenue is recognized, an estimate of future warranty costs is recorded as a component of cost of revenues. Factors that affect the warranty obligation include product failure rates, service delivery costs incurred in correcting the product failures, and warranty policies. The warranty obligation does not consider historical experience of the Fitbit Force product as a separate reserve has been established for the Fitbit Force recall. Our products are manufactured by contractor manufacturers, and in certain cases, we may have recourse to such contract manufacturers.\nFitbit Force Product Recall\nWe established reserves for the Fitbit Force recall when circumstances giving rise to the recall became known. We considered various factors in estimating the product recall exposure. These include estimates for:\n \u2022 refunds and product returns from retailer and distributor customers and end-users, which were charged to revenue and cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations; \n \u2022 logistics and handling fees for managing product returns and processing refunds, obsolescence of on-hand inventory, cancellation charges for existing purchase commitments and rework of component inventory by our contract \nmanufacturers, write-offs of tooling and manufacturing equipment, which were charged to cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations; and\n \u2022 legal fees and settlement costs, which were charged to general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. \nThese factors above are updated and reevaluated each period and the related reserves are adjusted when factors indicate that the recall reserves are either insufficient to cover or exceed the estimated product recall expenses.\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to tangible assets, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is allocated to goodwill. The allocation of the purchase consideration requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired customers, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Consistent with our determination that we have one reporting segment, we have determined that there is one reporting unit and test goodwill for impairment at the entity level. We test goodwill using the two-step process in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. In the first step, we compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit to the fair value based on the fair value of our common stock. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, goodwill is potentially impaired and the second step of the impairment test must be performed. In the second step, we would compare the implied fair value of the goodwill, as defined by ASC 350, to its carrying amount to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any.\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any such impairment charge during the years presented.\nIncome Taxes\nWe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments to determine our expense (benefit) for income taxes and also for deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded against our deferred tax assets. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance.\nThe calculation of our income tax expense involves the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments while taking into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of future tax audits. We have established reserves to address potential exposures related to tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. Although we believe our estimates, assumptions, and judgments to be reasonable, any changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolutions of potential tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe calculation of our deferred tax asset balance involves the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments while taking into account estimates of the amounts and type of future taxable income. Actual future operating results and the underlying amount and type of income could differ materially from our estimates, assumptions, and judgments, thereby impacting our financial position and operating results.\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits have been recognized in the appropriate periods presented.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment. The fair value of restricted stock units, or RSUs, is the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and shares issued under our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or 2015 ESPP. The determination of the grant date fair value of stock options and shares issued under our 2015 ESPP using an option-pricing model is affected by our estimated common stock fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables. These variables include the fair value of our common stock, our expected common stock price volatility over the expected life of the options, expected term of the stock option, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends, which are estimated as follows:\nFair Value of Our Common Stock. Prior to our initial public offering, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying stock options was historically established by our board of directors, which was responsible for these estimates, and was based in part upon a valuation provided by an independent third-party valuation firm. Because there was no public market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering, our board of directors considered this independent valuation and other factors, including, but not limited to, revenue growth, the current status of the technical and commercial success of our operations, our financial condition, the stage of our development, and competition to establish the fair value of our common stock at the time of grant of the option. The fair value of the underlying common stock was determined by the board of directors until our common stock was listed on a stock exchange. For stock options and RSUs granted subsequent to our initial public offering, the fair value was based on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term represents the period over which we anticipate stock-based awards to be outstanding. We do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time stock-based awards have been exercisable. As a result, for stock options, we used the simplified method to calculate the expected term estimate based on the vesting and contractual terms of the option. Under the simplified method, the expected term is equal to the average of the stock-based award's weighted average vesting period and its contractual term. The expected term of equity awards issued under our 2015 ESPP is the contractual term.\nVolatility. Expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which the stock price is expected to fluctuate. We estimate the expected volatility of the common stock underlying our stock options and equity awards issued under our 2015 ESPP at the grant date by taking the average historical volatility of the common stock of a group of comparable publicly traded companies over a period equal to the expected life. We use this method because we have limited information on the volatility of our Class A common stock because of our short trading history.\nRisk-Free Rate. The risk-free interest rate is estimated average interest rate based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon notes with terms consistent with the expected term of the awards.\nDividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.\nIn addition, we are required to estimate the amount of stock-based compensation we expect to be forfeited based on our historical experience. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the stock-based awards represent management judgment. As a result, if factors change and different assumptions are used, the stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, or ASU 2014-09, regarding Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This ASU affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods and services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance when it becomes effective. The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the currently effective guidance. These\nmay include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the standard. ASU 2014-09 will become effective for us on January 1, 2018 and can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. Early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date of annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This ASU requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. We early adopted this accounting standard retrospectively in our fourth quarter of 2015 and reclassified all our current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This ASU requires lease assets and lease liabilities arising from leases, including operating leases, to be recognized on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 will become effective for us on January 1, 2019, and requires adoption using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_tables": "Table 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

platform that helps people achieve their health and fitness goals through devices, software, and services. \n- Revenue grew very rapidly from $271 million in 2013 to $1.86 billion in 2015, driven by sales of wearable devices and growth in the number of devices sold each year.\n\n2015 Performance\n- Revenue grew 149% year-over-year to $1.86 billion. New products released in late 2014 were the primary growth driver.\n- Gross margin remained flat at 48% as lower margins on new products were offset by reduced recall costs and lower warranty expenses.  \n- Operating expenses grew due to increases in R&D, sales & marketing, and G&A expenses to support business growth.\n- Net income grew to $176 million from $132 million.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- Fitbit has a strong cash position, with $536 million in cash/cash equivalents and $129 million in marketable securities. \n- Cash from operations was $109 million. Additional cash was raised through public stock offerings.\n- Fitbit has a $250 million credit facility available but has no outstanding borrowings currently.\n- Fitbit believes it has sufficient capital resources to meet working capital and investment requirements for at least the next 12 months.\n\n Critical Accounting Policies\n- Revenue recognition, rights of return, stock rotation rights, product warranty, Fitbit Force recall reserves, valuation of inventories, business combinations and goodwill, income taxes, and stock-based compensation are considered critical accounting policies and estimates.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions on the summary!"}
