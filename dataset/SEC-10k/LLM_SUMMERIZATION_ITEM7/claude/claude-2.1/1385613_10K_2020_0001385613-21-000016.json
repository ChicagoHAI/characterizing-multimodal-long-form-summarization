MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nReferences to we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d our company,\u201d or the Company\u201d refer to Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd. ( GLRE\u201d) and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Greenlight Reinsurance, Ltd, ( Greenlight Re\u201d), Greenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company ( GRIL\u201d), Greenlight Re Marketing (UK) Limited ( Greenlight Re UK\u201d) and Verdant Holding Company, Ltd. ( Verdant\u201d), unless the context dictates otherwise. References to our Ordinary Shares\u201d refers collectively to our Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which appear elsewhere in this filing.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nLink to Table of Contents\nWe have omitted discussion of the earliest of the three years covered by our consolidated financial statements presented in this report because that disclosure was already included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2020. You are encouraged to reference Part II, Item 7, within that report, for a discussion of our financial condition and result of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nGeneral\nWe are a global specialty property and casualty reinsurer, headquartered in the Cayman Islands, with a reinsurance and investment strategy that we believe differentiates us from most of our competitors. Our goal is to build long-term shareholder value by providing risk management products and services to the insurance, reinsurance and other risk marketplaces. We focus on delivering risk solutions to clients and brokers who value our expertise, analytics and customer service offerings.\nWe aim to complement our underwriting results with a non-traditional investment approach in order to achieve higher rates of return over the long term than reinsurance companies that exclusively employ more traditional investment strategies. Our investment portfolio is managed according to a value-oriented philosophy, in which our investment advisor takes long positions in perceived undervalued securities and short positions in perceived overvalued securities.\nBecause we seek to capitalize on favorable market conditions and opportunities, period-to-period comparisons of our underwriting results may not be meaningful. Also, our historical investment results are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Due to the nature of our reinsurance and investment strategies, our operating results will likely fluctuate from period to period.\nThe Company's subsidiaries hold an A.M. Best Financial Strength Rating of A- (Excellent) with a negative outlook.\nOutlook and Trends\nCOVID-19 has created an unusually high level of uncertainty in the global reinsurance market. While we believe that our aggregate exposure to the pandemic is small compared to other industry participants, the impact of the pandemic and related risks could harm our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. For a further discussion of risks associated with COVID-19, see Risks Relating to our Business\u201d in Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nWhile the COVID-19 uncertainty has caused reserving challenges throughout the industry, it has also led to underwriting opportunities. The lack of clarity that we face is impacting the insurance and reinsurance market as a whole on a significantly larger scale. As reinsurers' reserves must accommodate a wide range of loss estimates, they could have less capital to deploy to new underwriting opportunities. We have already seen widespread pricing improvements, and this dynamic may be a significant driver of the increases.\nAdding to the reduction in capital was the unusually high frequency of loss events in 2020. Putting aside COVID-19, 2020 was the fifth costliest year in history regarding the impact of natural and human-made catastrophes on the insurance industry. While investors have injected new capital into the industry, we believe that this new capital represents a small portion of what has been lost or encumbered.\nCompared to most of our competitors, we are small and have low overhead expenses. We believe that our current expense efficiency, agility, and existing relationships have provided support to our competitive position and enable us to participate in lines of business that fit within our strategy. However, the current size of our capital base may reduce the number of high-quality underwriting opportunities that brokers refer to us. Additionally, a prolonged negative outlook from A.M. Best or an A.M. Best revision to our subsidiaries' ratings below A- (Excellent) may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategy. See Risks Relating to our Business\u201d in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOur growing Innovations business is increasing in importance as a source of attractive and lasting underwriting opportunities. Our Innovations partnerships generally enable us to add value to the relationship in multiple ways: as a strategic partner, a provider of risk capacity, and an investor. Investor interest in later-stage InsurTechs\u201d has surged in 2020, a development that is well-suited to our early-stage investment strategy.\nJanuary 1 is a key renewal date for the global reinsurance industry, and, as noted earlier, in 2021 we have seen improved rates in most of the classes of business we write. This hardening market enabled us to selectively expand our specialty book while taking advantage of improved rates. Our in-force portfolio reflects increased diversity across the classes of business we write and a lower concentration risk to individual counterparties. We are pleased with the progress we have made in growing and repositioning our underwriting book, and we expect that the newly formed Greenlight Re UK will help us secure further underwriting opportunities in the future.\nLink to Table of Contents\nSegments\nWe have one operating segment, Property & Casualty reinsurance, and we analyze our business based on the following categories:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Property </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Casualty </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Other </td> </tr>\n</table>\nProperty business covers automobile physical damage, personal lines (including homeowners' insurance) and commercial lines exposures. Property business includes both catastrophe as well as non-catastrophe coverage. We expect catastrophe business to make up a small proportion of our property business.\nCasualty business covers general liability, motor liability, professional liability and workers' compensation exposures. The Company's multi-line business relates predominantly to casualty reinsurance and as such all multi-line business is included within the casualty category. Casualty business generally has losses reported and paid over a longer period of time than property business.\nOther business covers accident and health, financial lines (including transactional liability, mortgage insurance, surety and trade credit), marine, energy, and to a lesser extent, other specialty business such as aviation, crop, cyber, political and terrorism exposures.\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues from two principal sources:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>premiums from reinsurance on property and casualty business assumed; and </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>income from investments. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognize premiums written as revenues, net of any applicable underlying reinsurance coverage, over the term of the related policy or contract. Depending on the contract structure, the earnings period could be the same as the reinsurance contract, or based on the terms of the underlying insurance policies.\nIncome from our investments is primarily composed of:\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>income (or loss) generated from our investment in SILP;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>gains (or losses) from our other investments including Innovations and an investment accounted for as equity method investment;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>interest income from money market funds; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>interest income and gains (or losses) from promissory notes receivable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, we may from time to time derive other income from gains on deposit accounted contracts, fees generated from advisory services and fees relating to overrides, profit commissions and the contractual fees upon early termination of contracts.\nExpenses\nOur expenses consist primarily of the following:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>underwriting losses and loss adjustment expenses; </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>acquisition costs; </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>general and administrative expenses; </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>interest expense; and </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>investment-related expenses. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe extent of our loss and LAE is a function of the amount and type of reinsurance contracts we write and the loss experience of the underlying coverage. As described below, loss and loss adjustment expenses include an actuarially determined estimate of losses incurred, including losses incurred during the period and changes in estimates from prior periods. The period over which we pay loss and LAE reserves depends on the nature of the coverage provided and generally extends over a period of multiple years.\nAcquisition costs consist primarily of brokerage fees, ceding commissions, premium taxes, profit commissions, letters of credit and trust fees, and federal excise taxes. We amortize deferred acquisition costs relating to successfully bound reinsurance contracts over the related contract term.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits and related costs, including costs associated with our incentive compensation plan, bonuses and stock compensation expenses. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees, travel and entertainment, information technology, rent and other general operating costs. General and administrative expenses reported on our consolidated statements of operations include both underwriting and corporate expenses.\nFor stock option expenses, we calculate compensation cost using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognize the associated expense over the stock options' vesting periods, which vary and have historically ranged from zero to six years. For restricted stock awards and restricted stock units with only service conditions, we calculate compensation cost using the grant date fair value of each award and recognize the associated expense of the stock awards over their vesting periods, which typically range from one to three years. For restricted stock awards that include both service and performance conditions, we recognize the associated expense when we determine that it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved.\nInterest expense consists of interest paid and accrued on senior convertible notes and the amortization of (i) issuance expenses and (ii) the note discount.\nInvestment-related expenses primarily consist of management fees and performance compensation paid to the investment advisor. We net these expenses against investment income (loss) in our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective and have required management to make assumptions and best estimates to determine reported values. If certain factors, including those described in Part I. Item IA. - Risk Factors,\u201d cause actual events or results to differ materially from our underlying assumptions or estimates, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We believe that the following accounting policies affect the more significant estimates used to prepare of our consolidated financial statements. We have summarized the descriptions below for clarity. We have included a more detailed description of our significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\nPremium Revenues and Risk Transfer. We record our property and casualty reinsurance premiums as premiums written based upon contract terms and information received from ceding companies and their brokers. Excess of loss reinsurance contracts typically state premiums as a percentage of the subject premiums written by the client, subject to a minimum and deposit premium. The minimum and deposit premium is generally based on an estimate of subject premiums expected to be written by the client during the contract term. The minimum and deposit premium is reported initially as premiums written and adjusted, if necessary, in subsequent periods once the actual subject premium is known.\nCertain contracts provide for reinstatement premiums in the event of a loss. Reinstatement premiums are written and earned when a triggering loss event occurs.\nOur client estimates gross premiums written at the contract's inception for each proportional contract we underwrite. We generally account for such premiums using our best estimates and then adjust our estimates based on our client's actual reports and based on our expectations of industry developments. As the contract progresses, we monitor actual premiums received in conjunction with the client's correspondence to refine our estimate. Variances from initial gross premiums written estimates are generally greater for proportional contracts than for non-proportional contracts. We earn premiums on proportional contracts over the risk coverage period. Unearned premiums represent the unexpired portion of reinsurance provided.\nAt the inception of each of our reinsurance contracts, we receive premium estimates from the client, which, we use in conjunction with historical and and industry data to estimate what we believe will be the ultimate premium payable under each contract. We receive actual premiums written by each client as the client reports the actual results of the underlying insurance\nLink to Table of Contents\nwritings to us monthly or quarterly (depending on the contract). We book the actual premiums written when we receive them from our client. Each reporting period we estimate the premiums written for stub periods that have not yet been reported to us by the client. For example, at year-end we may have to estimate December premiums ceded under certain contracts since the client may not be required to report the actual results to us until after we have issued our audited consolidated financial statements. Typically, we only use premium estimates for unreported stub periods, which account for a small percentage of our total premiums written.\nWe confirm the accuracy and completeness of premiums reported by our clients by reviewing the client's statutory filings or performing an audit of the client under the contract terms. Discrepancies between premiums ceded and reported under a contract are, in our experience, rare. To date, we have not had any material difference in premiums reported by a client that required a formal dispute resolution process.\nAssessing whether a reinsurance contract meets the conditions for risk transfer requires judgment. The determination of risk transfer is critical to reporting premiums written and is based, in part, on the use of actuarial and pricing models and assumptions. If we determine that a reinsurance contract does not transfer sufficient risk to merit reinsurance accounting treatment, the premium we receive is reported as a deposit liability. Similarly, we report the premium we pay as a deposit asset for ceded contracts that do not transfer sufficient risk to merit reinsurance accounting. Any gains or losses on deposit accounted contracts are calculated using the interest method and recorded in the consolidated statements of operations under the caption Other income (expense).\u201d\nInvestments. We carry our investment in SILP at fair value, based on the most recent net asset value obtained from SILP's third-party administrator. The caption Other investments\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets includes private and unlisted equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. We determine these private equity securities' carrying value based on the original cost, reviewed for impairment and any subsequent changes in the valuation based on any recent observable transactions. We determine realized gains and losses from other investments based on specific identification method (by reference to cost or amortized cost, as appropriate). These gains and losses are included in the captions Net investment income (loss)\u201d in the consolidated statements of operations.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves.The process of estimating our loss and LAE reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment and our estimates as of any given date are inherently uncertain. Estimating loss and LAE reserves requires us to make assumptions regarding reporting and development patterns, frequency and severity trends, claims settlement practices, potential changes in legal environments, inflation, loss amplification, foreign exchange movements and other factors. These estimates and judgments are based on numerous considerations and are often revised as: (i) we receive changes in loss amounts reported by ceding companies and brokers; (ii) we obtain additional information, experience or other data; (iii) we develop new or improved methodologies; or (iv) we observe changes in the legal environment.\nOur loss and LAE reserves relating to short-tail property risks are typically reported to us and settled more promptly than those relating to our long-tail risks. However, the timeliness of loss reporting can be affected by such factors as the nature of the event causing the loss, the location of the loss, whether the loss is from policies in force with primary insurers or with reinsurers and where our exposure falls within the cedent's overall reinsurance program.\nOur loss and LAE reserves are composed of case reserves (which are based on claims that have been reported to us) and IBNR reserves.\nWe determine case reserve estimates based on loss reports received. We determine our IBNR reserve estimates using various actuarial methods as well as a combination of our own historical and current loss experience, insurance industry loss experience, assessments of pricing adequacy trends and our professional judgment. In estimating our IBNR reserve, we project our estimated ultimate loss and LAE reserves and then subtract paid claims and case reserves to arrive at our IBNR reserve.\nThe nature and extent of our judgment in the reserving process depend in part upon the type of business. Some of our property treaty reinsurance contracts represent business with both a low frequency of claims occurrence and a high potential severity of loss, such as claims arising from natural catastrophes. Given the high-severity, low-frequency nature of these events, the losses typically generated by them do not lend themselves to traditional actuarial reserving methods, such as statistical calculations of a range of estimates surrounding the best point estimate of our loss and LAE reserves. Therefore, our reserving approach for this type of business estimates the ultimate cost associated with a single loss event rather than analyzing the historical development patterns of past losses as a means of estimating the ultimate losses for an entire accident year. We estimate our reserves for these large events on a contract-by-contract basis by reviewing policies with known or potential exposure to a particular loss event.\nLink to Table of Contents\nFor non-catastrophe losses, we often apply trend-based actuarial methodologies in setting reserves, including paid and incurred loss development, Bornheutter-Ferguson, and frequency and severity techniques. We also utilize industry loss ratio and development pattern information in conjunction with our own experience. The weight given to a particular method will depend on many factors, including the homogeneity within the class of business, the volume of losses, the maturity of the accident year, and the length of the expected development tail. For example, development methods rely on reported losses, while expected loss ratio methods typically rely on expectations established before notification of loss. Therefore, as an accident year matures, we may migrate from an expected loss ratio method to an incurred development method.\nReserving can prove especially difficult should a significant loss occur near the end of a financial reporting period, particularly if the loss involves a catastrophic event. These factors further contribute to the degree of uncertainty in our reserving process.\nAs a predominantly broker-market reinsurer for both excess-of-loss and proportional contracts, we must rely on loss information reported to brokers by primary insurers who, in turn, must estimate their losses at the policy level, often based on incomplete and changing information. The information we receive varies by cedent and may include paid losses, estimated case reserves and an estimated provision for IBNR reserves. Reserving practices and data reporting quality vary among ceding companies, which adds further uncertainty to our estimation of ultimate losses. The nature and extent of information received from ceding companies and brokers also vary widely depending on the type of coverage, the contractual reporting terms (which are affected by market conditions and practices), and other factors. Due to the lack of standardization of the terms and conditions of reinsurance contracts, the wide variability of coverage provided to individual clients, and the tendency of those coverages to change rapidly in response to market conditions, we cannot always reliably measure the ongoing economic impact of such uncertainties and inconsistencies.\nTime lags are inherent in loss reporting, especially in the case of excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts. The combined characteristics of low claim frequency and high claim severity make the available data less useful for predicting ultimate losses. In the case of proportional contracts, we rely on an analysis of a cedent's historical experience, industry information, and the underwriters' professional judgment in estimating reserves for these contracts. We also utilize ultimate loss ratio forecasts when reported by cedents and brokers, which are ordinarily subject to three to six-month lags for proportional business. Due to the degree of reliance we place on ceding companies for claims reporting, our reserve estimates are highly dependent on ceding companies' judgment. Furthermore, during the loss settlement period, which may last several years, additional facts regarding individual claims and trends will often become known and case law may change, affecting ultimate expected losses.\nSince we rely on ceding company estimates of case and IBNR reserves in the process of establishing our loss and LAE reserves, we maintain procedures designed to mitigate the risk that such information is incomplete or inaccurate. These procedures may include: (i) comparisons of expected premiums to reported premiums, which helps us to identify delinquent client periodic reports; (ii) ceding company audits to identify inaccurate or incomplete reporting of claims and ensure that claims are actively and appropriately managed in line with agreed protocols and settlement authority limits; and (iii) underwriting reviews to ascertain that the losses ceded are covered as provided under the contract terms. Each subsequent year of loss experience with a given cedent also provides additional insight into the accuracy and timeliness of previously reported information. These procedures are incorporated in our internal controls and are regularly evaluated and amended as market conditions, risk factors, and unanticipated areas of exposure develop.\nWe monitor the development of our prior-year losses during subsequent calendar years by comparing the actual reported losses against previous estimates. The analysis of this loss development is an essential factor in the ongoing refinement of our reserving process's assumptions.\nEstimating loss reserves for our book of longer-tail casualty reinsurance business, which we write on proportional and non-proportional basis, involves further uncertainties. In addition to the uncertainties inherent in the reserving process referred to above, casualty business can be subject to longer reporting lags than property business, and claims often take several years to settle. During this period, additional factors and trends will be revealed and, as they become apparent, we may adjust our reserves. There is also the potential for the emergence of new types of losses within our casualty book. Therefore, any factors that extend the time until our cedents settle claims add uncertainty to the reserving process. Furthermore, determining the appropriate level of casualty reserves is largely dependent upon our view of premium rates at any given time. Therefore, overestimating the extent to which premium rates have increased (or decreased) can lead to an understatement (or overstatement) of loss reserves.\nThe uncertainties inherent in the reserving process, together with the potential for unforeseen developments, including changes in laws and the prevailing interpretation of policy terms, may result in our loss and LAE reserves being materially greater or less than the loss and LAE reserves we initially established. We reflect adjustments to our loss and LAE reserves in our financial results during the period in which they are determined. Changes to our prior year loss reserves will impact our\nLink to Table of Contents\ncurrent underwriting results by improving our results if the prior year reserves prove redundant or impairing our results if the prior year reserves prove insufficient.\nWe believe that our reserves for loss and LAE are sufficient to cover losses that fall within the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers based on the methodologies used to estimate those reserves. However, we can provide no assurance that actual losses will not (i) be less than or (ii) exceed our total established reserves.\nPlease refer to Notes 2 and 7 of our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed explanation of our loss reserving methodology and the loss development tables by accident year, respectively, as required under U.S. GAAP.\nBonus Accruals. Under the Company's bonus program, most employees' target bonuses consist of two components: a discretionary component based on a qualitative assessment of each employee's performance and a quantitative component based on the return on deployed equity ( RODE\u201d) for each underwriting year relating to reinsurance operations. The qualitative portion of an employee's annual bonus is accrued quarterly at each employee's pro rata target amount and updated to actual at year-end. We accrue the quantitative portion of each employee's annual bonus based on the expected RODE for each underwriting year. We then adjust this accrual for changes in the expected RODE and actual investment return each quarter until we have settled all losses, or the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors declares the underwriting year closed. We incorporate any subsequent changes to any open underwriting year's quantitative bonus into the following underwriting year. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approves all quantitative bonuses before their payment dates. The initial RODE calculation utilizes proprietary models which require significant estimation and judgment. Actual RODE may vary significantly from the expected RODE, and any adjustments to the quantitative bonus estimates, which may be material, are recorded in the period in which they are determined.\nShare-Based Payments. We have established a stock incentive plan for directors, employees and consultants. We recognize share-based compensation transactions using the fair value at the award's grant date. We calculate the compensation for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) based on the price of the Company's common shares at the grant date. We recognize the associated expense, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, over the vesting period and incorporate the probability of meeting any performance conditions. We estimate the forfeiture rate for restricted stock awards and RSUs based on our historical experience and our expectations of future forfeitures. The forfeiture rate reduces the unamortized grant date fair value of unvested outstanding restricted stock awards and RSUs and the associated stock compensation expense. As restricted shares and RSUs are forfeited, we reduce the number of outstanding restricted shares and RSUs and compare the remaining unamortized grant date fair value to the assumed forfeiture levels. We record true-up adjustments as deemed necessary. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we have assumed a forfeiture rate of 7.0% (2019: 7.0% and 2018: 7.0%) for restricted stock awards and RSUs granted.\nWe recognize the expense of share purchase options over the vesting period on a graded vesting basis. Determining the fair value of share option awards at the grant date requires significant estimation and judgment. We use an option-pricing model (Black-Scholes pricing model) to assist in calculating of fair value. We base the estimate of expected volatility on our Class A ordinary shares' daily historical trading data from the date that these shares commenced trading (May 24, 2007) to the grant date.\nIf actual results differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions, particularly concerning our estimation of volatility and forfeiture rates, share-based compensation expense, primarily relating to future share-based awards, could be materially impacted.\nKey Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures\nManagement uses certain key financial measures, some of which are not prescribed under U.S. GAAP rules and standards ( non-GAAP financial measures\u201d), to evaluate our financial performance, financial position and the change in shareholder value. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined in SEC Regulation G, is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented under U.S. GAAP. We believe that these measures, which may be calculated or defined differently by other companies, provide consistent and comparable metrics of our business performance to help shareholders understand performance trends and allow for a more thorough understanding of the Company's business. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined under U.S. GAAP. The key non-GAAP financial measures used in this report are:\n\u2022Basic book value per share;\n\u2022Fully diluted book value per share;\nLink to Table of Contents\n\u2022Adjusted combined ratio; and\n\u2022Net underwriting income (loss).\nThese non-GAAP measures are described below.\nBasic Book Value Per Share and Fully Diluted Book Value Per Share\nWe believe that long-term growth in fully diluted book value per share is the most relevant measure of our financial performance because it provides management and investors a yardstick to monitor the shareholder value generated. Fully diluted book value per share may also help our investors, shareholders and other interested parties form a basis of comparison with other companies within the property and casualty reinsurance industry.\nWe calculate basic book value per share based on ending shareholders' equity and aggregate of Class A and Class B Ordinary shares issued and outstanding, as well as all unvested restricted shares. Fully diluted book value per share represents basic book value per share combined with any dilutive impact of in-the-money stock options and RSUs issued and outstanding as of any period end. Fully diluted book value per share also includes the dilutive effect, if any, of ordinary shares to be issued upon conversion of the convertible notes. Basic book value per share and fully diluted book value per share should not be viewed as substitutes for the comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nOur primary financial goal is to increase fully diluted book value per share over the long term.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures basic and fully diluted book value per share to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> ($ in thousands, except per share and share amounts) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Numerator for basic and fully diluted book value per share: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total equity (U.S. GAAP) (numerator for basic and fully diluted book value per share) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>464,857 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>477,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>477,772 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Denominator for basic and fully diluted book value per share: (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ordinary shares issued and outstanding (denominator for basic book value per share) </td> <td>34,514,790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,994,110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,384,929 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: In-the-money stock options and RSUs issued and outstanding </td> <td>116,722 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,398 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Denominator for fully diluted book value per share </td> <td>34,631,512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,057,692 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,431,327 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic book value per share </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in basic book value per share ($) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.22) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9.13) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in basic book value per share (%) </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(41.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fully diluted book value per share </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in fully diluted book value per share ($) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.22) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9.12) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in fully diluted book value per share (%) </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(41.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) All unvested restricted shares, including those with performance conditions, are included in the basic\u201d and fully diluted\u201d denominators.

We use the combined ratio, as well as an adjusted combined ratio that excludes the impacts of certain items, to evaluate our underwriting performance. We believe this adjusted non-GAAP measure provides management and financial statement users with a better understanding of the factors influencing our underwriting results.\nIn calculating the adjusted combined ratio, we exclude underwriting losses attributable to (i) prior accident-year reserve development, (ii) catastrophe losses, and (iii) certain significant, infrequent loss events.\nLink to Table of Contents\n\u2022Prior accident-year reserve development, which can be favorable or unfavorable, represents changes in our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with loss events that occurred in prior years. We believe a discussion of current accident-year performance, which excludes prior accident-year reserve development, is helpful since it provides more insight into current underwriting performance.\n\u2022By their nature, catastrophe losses and other significant, infrequent loss events are not representative of the type of loss activity that we would expect to occur in every period. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has certain characteristics that are unlike those of any other event in recent history.\nWe believe an adjusted combined ratio that excludes the effects of items such as these aids in understanding the underlying trends and variability in our underwriting results that may be obscured by these items.\nThe following table reconciles the combined ratio to the adjusted combined ratio:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio </td> <td>100.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>106.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>102.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact on combined ratio of selected items: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior-year development </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Catastrophes </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COVID-19 </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted combined ratio </td> <td>96.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>97.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>97.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Underwriting Income (Loss)\nOne way that we evaluate the Company's underwriting performance is through the measurement of net underwriting income (loss). We do not use premiums written as a measure of performance. Net underwriting income (loss) is a performance measure used by management to measure the fundamentals underlying the Company's underwriting operations. We believe that the use of net underwriting income (loss) enables investors and other users of the Company's financial information to analyze our performance in a manner similar to how management analyzes performance. Management also believes that this measure follows industry practice and allows the users of financial information to compare the Company's performance with those of our industry peer group.\nNet underwriting income (loss) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes items used to calculate net income before taxes under U.S. GAAP. We calculate net underwriting income (loss) as net premiums earned, plus other income (expense) relating to reinsurance and deposit-accounted contracts, less net loss and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition costs, and underwriting expenses. The measure excludes, on a recurring basis: (1) investment income (loss); (2) other income (expense) not related to underwriting, including foreign exchange gains or losses and adjustments to the allowance for expected credit losses; (3) corporate general and administrative expenses; (4) interest expense and (5) income taxes. We exclude total investment income or loss and foreign exchange gains or losses as we believe these items are influenced by market conditions and other factors not related to underwriting decisions. We exclude corporate expenses because these expenses are generally fixed and not incremental to or directly related to our underwriting operations. We believe all of these amounts are largely independent of our underwriting process, and including them could hinder the analysis of trends in our underwriting operations. Net underwriting income (loss) should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income.\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe reconciliations of net underwriting income (loss) to income (loss) before income taxes (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) on a consolidated basis is shown below:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The increases in basic and fully diluted book value per share for the year ended December 31, 2020 were due primarily to (i) share repurchases executed, (ii) net income earned, and (iii) restricted shares forfeited during the year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the net income was $3.9 million, compared to a net loss attributable to the Company of $4.0 million reported for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe developments that most significantly affected our financial performance during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the equivalent 2019 period, are summarized below:\n\u2022Underwriting: The underwriting loss for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $1.6 million on net earned premiums of $455.4 million. By comparison, the underwriting loss for the same period in 2019 was $33.5 million on net earned premiums of $483.6 million, primarily resulting from adverse loss development on our private passenger automobile business.\nCatastrophe events during the year ended December 31, 2020, including Hurricane Laura, Isaias, and Sally, the Midwest derecho storms, and North American wildfires contributed $9.0 million to the underwriting loss. Additionally, COVID-19 contributed $7.1 million to the underwriting loss for the year ended December 31, 2020. By comparison, the catastrophe events during 2019, including Hurricane Dorian and Typhoons Faxai and Hagibis, contributed $17.4 million to the underwriting loss for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOur overall combined ratio was 100.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 106.9% during the same period in 2019.

This increase in workers' compensation premiums written was primarily due to an expanded relationship with an existing cedent and as a restructured and renewed contract that we recorded on a deposit accounting basis during the comparative period in 2019.

The Governor-In-Cabinet has granted us an exemption from any income taxes that may be imposed in the Cayman Islands for a period of 20 years, expiring on February 1, 2025.\nGRIL is incorporated in Ireland and is subject to the Irish corporation tax. We expect GRIL to be taxed at a 12.5% rate on its taxable trading income, and 25% on its non-trading income, if any.\nVerdant is incorporated in Delaware and is subject to taxes under the U.S. federal rates and regulations prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service. We expect Verdant's future taxable income to be taxed at a rate of 21%.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have included a gross deferred tax asset of $3.5 million (2019: $3.6 million) in the caption Other assets\u201d in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2020, a valuation allowance of $3.0 million (2019: $2.6 million) partially offset this gross deferred tax asset. Based on the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and the likelihood of generating sufficient taxable income to realize the future tax benefit, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the recorded deferred tax asset (net of the valuation allowance). The Company has not taken any other tax positions that we believe are subject to uncertainty or reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company, GRIL or Verdant.\nLink to Table of Contents\nRatio Analysis\nThe following table provides our underwriting ratios by line of business:\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Property </td> <td> </td> <td>Casualty </td> <td> </td> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Property </td> <td> </td> <td>Casualty </td> <td> </td> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss ratio </td> <td>69.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>71.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>83.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>74.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>82.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>81.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>73.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>80.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition cost ratio </td> <td>20.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Composite ratio </td> <td>90.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>98.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>98.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>101.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>105.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>105.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>104.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Condition\nTotal investments\nThe total investments reported in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020, was $196.2 million, compared to $256.4 million as of December 31, 2019, a decrease of $60.2 million, or 23.5%. The decrease was primarily related to withdrawals from SILP for claim payments, funding collateral for our cedents and posting Funds at Lloyd's to support the reinsurance contracts with Lloyd's syndicates. We include the Funds at Lloyd's in the caption Reinsurance balances receivable\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets. The decrease was partially offset by investment income from our investment in SILP and an increase in the valuation of investments related to Innovations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 94.0% of SILP's investments were valued based on quoted prices in actively traded markets (Level 1), 2.2% was composed of instruments valued based on observable inputs other than quoted prices (Level 2), and 0.8% was composed of instruments valued based on non-observable inputs (Level 3). As of December 31, 2020, 3.0% of SILP's investments were private equity funds valued using the funds' net asset values as a practical expedient.\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents\nWe use our restricted cash and cash equivalents for funding trusts and letters of credits issued to our ceding insurers. Our restricted cash increased by $3.3 million, or 0.4%, from $742.1 million as of December 31, 2019, to $745.4 million, as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to a net increase in collateral held in trusts by our ceding insurers.\nReinsurance balances receivable\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, reinsurance balances receivable increased by $99.8 million, or 43.3%, to $330.2 million from $230.4 million, as of December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily related to Funds at Lloyd's to support the reinsurance contracts with Lloyd's syndicates. To a lesser extent, the increase related to premiums written and not yet collected from cedents on new and renewed contracts.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves; Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Recoverable\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and we do not have previous loss experience on which to base estimates for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves related to this pandemic. See Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for assumptions used in our loss estimates relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Losses in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic subsequent to December 31, 2020 will be reflected in the periods in which those losses are incurred.\nLink to Table of Contents\nReserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses were composed of the following:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Case\nReserves </td> <td> </td> <td>IBNR </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Case\nReserves </td> <td> </td> <td>IBNR </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,833 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,476 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Casualty </td> <td>138,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>206,152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>344,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>152,049 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>204,574 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>356,623 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>12,540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,542 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,489 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>176,805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>317,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>494,179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>252,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>470,588 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the total gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves increased by $23.6 million, or 5.0% to $494.2 million from $470.6 million as of December 31, 2019. See Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of changes in outstanding loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and for a description of prior period loss developments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the total loss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable decreased by $10.7 million, or 38.8%, to $16.9 million from $27.5 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease primarily related to losses recovered relating to retroceded private passenger automobile contracts that were not renewed during 2019. See Note 8 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the credit risk associated with our retrocessionaires.\nFor most of the contracts we write, our risk exposure is limited by defined limits of liability. Once each contract's limit of liability has been reached, we have no further exposure to additional losses from that contract. However, certain contracts, particularly quota share contracts that relate to first-dollar exposure, may not contain aggregate limits.\nOur property business, and to a lesser extent our casualty and other business, incorporate contracts that contain natural peril loss exposure. We estimate catastrophe loss exposure in terms of the PML. We anticipate that the PML will vary from period to period depending upon the modeled simulated losses and the composition of the in-force book of business. The projected severity levels are described in terms of a 1-in-250 year return period. The 1-in-250 year return period PML means that we believe there is a 0.4% chance in any given year that an occurrence of a natural catastrophe will lead to losses exceeding the stated estimate. In other words, it corresponds to a 99.6% probability that the loss from an event will fall below the indicated PML.\nPMLs are estimates and as a result, we cannot provide any assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event PML. The PML estimate incorporates all significant exposure from our reinsurance operations, including coverage for property, marine and energy, motor and catastrophe workers' compensation.\nAs of January 1, 2021, our estimated PML exposure (net of retrocession and reinstatement premiums) at a 1-in-250 year return period for a single event and in aggregate was $86.8 million and $109.6 million, respectively. The following table provides the PML for single event loss exposure and aggregate loss exposure to natural peril losses for each of the peak zones as of January 1, 2021:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>January 1, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-in-250 year return period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Zone </td> <td> </td> <td>Single Event Loss </td> <td> </td> <td>Aggregate Loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States, Canada and the Caribbean </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>86,771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>99,613 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe </td> <td> </td> <td>44,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Japan </td> <td> </td> <td>39,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,570 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rest of the world </td> <td> </td> <td>48,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum </td> <td> </td> <td>86,771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109,574 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLink to Table of Contents\nTotal shareholders' equity\nTotal equity reported on the consolidated balance sheet decreased by $12.3 million to $464.9 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $477.2 million as of December 31, 2019. Retained earnings increased primarily due to a net income of $3.9 million reported for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company repurchased 2.5 million Class A ordinary shares during the year ended December 31, 2020 resulting in a $17.8 million decrease in shareholders' equity. For details of other movements in shareholders' equity see Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity.\u201d\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nGreenlight Capital Re is organized as a holding company with no operations of its own. As a holding company, Greenlight Capital Re has minimal continuing cash needs, most of which are related to the payment of administrative expenses and interest expense. All of our underwriting operations are conducted through our wholly-owned reinsurance subsidiaries, Greenlight Re and GRIL, which underwrite property and casualty reinsurance. There are restrictions on each of Greenlight Re's and GRIL's ability to pay dividends, which are described in more detail below. It is our current policy to retain earnings to support the growth of our business. We currently do not expect to pay dividends on our ordinary shares.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Greenlight Re and GRIL were each rated A- (Excellent)\u201d with a negative outlook, by A.M. Best. On July 22, 2020, A.M. Best affirmed the A- (Excellent)\u201d ratings. The ratings reflect A.M. Best's opinion of our reinsurance subsidiaries' financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations and it is not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our Class A ordinary shares. If A.M. Best downgrades our ratings below A- (Excellent)\u201d or withdraws our rating, we could be severely limited or prevented from writing any new reinsurance contracts, which would significantly and negatively affect our business. Our A.M. Best ratings may be revised or revoked at the sole discretion of the rating agency.\nSources and Uses of Funds\nOur sources of funds consist primarily of premium receipts (net of brokerage and ceding commissions), investment income and other income. We use cash from our operations to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses, profit commissions, interest and general and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2020, all of our investable assets, excluding strategic investments and funds required for business operations and for capital risk management, are invested by DME Advisors in SILP, subject to our investment guidelines. We have the ability to redeem funds from SILP at any time for operational purposes by providing three days' notice to the general partner. As of December 31, 2020, the majority of SILP's long investments were composed of cash and cash equivalents, and publicly-traded equity securities, which can be readily liquidated to meet our redemption requests. We record all investment income (loss), including any changes in the net asset value of SILP, and any unrealized gains and losses, in our consolidated statements of operations for each reporting period.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, the net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $(91.3) million and $1.6 million, respectively. The net cash provided by (used in) our underwriting activities and for payment of corporate expenses was $(94.9) million and $(9.6) million for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Generally, if the premiums collected exceed claim payments within a given period, we generate cash from our underwriting activities. Our underwriting activities represented a net use of cash for the year ended December 31, 2020, as the losses we paid exceeded the premiums we collected. The cash used in, and generated from underwriting activities may vary significantly from period to period depending on the underwriting opportunities available and claims submitted to us by our cedents.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our investing activities provided cash of $95.6 million. The source of cash was primarily net withdrawals from SILP which were used to pay losses, provide support for the Lloyds syndicated business, and fund collateral required by our ceding insurers. By comparison, for the same period in 2019, our investing activities provided cash of $63.3 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we believe we have sufficient cash flow from operating and investing activities to meet our foreseeable liquidity requirements. We expect that our operational needs for liquidity will not be materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and will be met by cash, funds generated from underwriting activities and investment income, including withdrawals from SILP, if necessary. As of December 31, 2020, we expect to fund our operations for the next twelve months from operating and investing cash flows. Additionally, during 2021, we expect the release of collateral held by certain cedents as the exposure relating to those contracts has decreased.\nLink to Table of Contents\nWe may explore various financing alternatives, including capital raising alternatives, to fund our business strategy, improve our capital structure, increase surplus, pay claims or make acquisitions. We can provide no assurances that any such transactions will occur or, if so, as to the terms of such transactions.\nAlthough GLRE is not subject to any significant legal prohibitions on the payment of dividends, Greenlight Re and GRIL are each subject to regulatory minimum capital requirements and regulatory constraints that affect their ability to pay dividends to GLRE. In addition, any dividend payment would have to be approved by the relevant regulatory authorities prior to payment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received regulatory approval for a return of $15.0 million of Greenlight Re's share premium to GLRE to facilitate the share repurchases. In October 2020, we received regulatory approval for return of up to $25.0 million of Greenlight Re's share premium to GLRE in order to provide additional capital to GRIL. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we used $17.8 million to repurchase 2.5 million Class A ordinary shares. As of December 31, 2020, Greenlight Re and GRIL both exceeded the regulatory minimum capital requirements.\nLetters of Credit and Trust Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, neither Greenlight Re nor GRIL was licensed or admitted as a reinsurer in any jurisdiction other than the Cayman Islands and the European Economic Area, respectively. Because many jurisdictions do not permit domestic insurance companies to take credit on their statutory financial statements for loss recoveries or ceded unearned premiums unless appropriate measures are in place for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non-admitted insurers, we anticipate that all of our U.S. clients and some of our non-U.S. clients will require us to provide collateral through funds withheld, trust arrangements, letters of credit or a combination thereof.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had one (2019: one) letter of credit facility available with an aggregate capacity of $275.0 million (2019: $400.0 million). See Note 15 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for details on the letter of credit facility. We provide collateral to cedents in the form of letters of credit and trust arrangements. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of collateral provided to cedents under such arrangements was $743.0 million (2019: $733.2 million). As of December 31, 2020, the letters of credit and trust accounts were secured by restricted cash and cash equivalents with a total fair value of $745.4 million (2019: $742.1 million).\nThe letter of credit facility contains customary events of default and restrictive covenants, including but not limited to, limitations on liens on collateral, transactions with affiliates, mergers and sales of assets, as well as solvency and maintenance of certain minimum pledged equity requirements, and restricts issuance of any debt without the consent of the letter of credit provider. Additionally, if an event of default exists, as defined in the letter of credit facility, Greenlight Re would be prohibited from paying dividends to its parent company. The Company was in compliance with all the covenants of this facility as of December 31, 2020.\nCapital\nOur capital structure currently consists of senior convertible notes and equity issued in two classes of ordinary shares. We expect that the existing capital base and internally generated funds will be sufficient to implement our business strategy for the foreseeable future. Consequently, we do not presently anticipate that we will incur any additional material indebtedness in the ordinary course of our business. However, in order to provide us with flexibility and timely access to public capital markets should we require additional capital for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes, we have filed a Form S-3 registration statement, which expires in July 2021. In addition, as noted above, we may explore various financing alternatives, although there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms when needed or desired. We did not make any significant commitments for capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn March 26, 2020, the Board of Directors extended the share repurchase plan to June 30, 2021 and increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased to 5.0 million Class A ordinary shares or securities convertible into Class A ordinary shares in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or Rule 10b5-1 stock trading plans. In addition, the Board of Directors also authorized the Company to repurchase up to $25.0 million aggregate face amount of the Company's 4.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the Notes\u201d) in privately negotiated transactions, in open market repurchases or pursuant to one more tender offers. The Company is not required to repurchase any of the Class A ordinary shares or the Notes and the repurchase plans may be modified, suspended or terminated at the election of our Board of Directors at any time without prior notice. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 2.5 million Class A ordinary shares were repurchased by the Company. As of December 31, 2020, 2.5 million Class A ordinary shares and $25.0 million of the Notes, remained available for repurchase under the repurchase plans.\nLink to Table of Contents\nOn October 29, 2020, our shareholders approved an amendment to our stock incentive plan to increase the number of Class A ordinary shares available for issuance by 3.0 million shares from 5.0 million to 8.0 million shares.

The IAA has an initial term ending on August 31, 2023 subject to automatic extension for successive three-year terms. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, management fees paid by SILP to DME Advisors were $2.8 million and $4.9 million, respectively. Pursuant to the SILP LPA, DME II is entitled to a performance allocation equal to 20% of the net profit, calculated per annum, of each limited partner's share of the capital account managed by DME Advisors, subject to a loss carry forward provision. DME II is not entitled to earn a performance allocation in a year in which SILP incurs a loss. The loss carry forward provision contained in the SILP LPA allows DME II to earn reduced performance allocation of 10% of net profits in years subsequent to the year in which the capital accounts of the limited partners incur a loss, until all losses are recouped and an additional amount equal to 150% of the loss is earned.

References to our Ordinary Shares\u201d refers collectively to our Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which appear elsewhere in this filing.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nLink to Table of Contents\nWe have omitted discussion of the earliest of the three years covered by our consolidated financial statements presented in this report because that disclosure was already included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2020. You are encouraged to reference Part II, Item 7, within that report, for a discussion of our financial condition and result of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nGeneral\nWe are a global specialty property and casualty reinsurer, headquartered in the Cayman Islands, with a reinsurance and investment strategy that we believe differentiates us from most of our competitors. Our goal is to build long-term shareholder value by providing risk management products and services to the insurance, reinsurance and other risk marketplaces. We focus on delivering risk solutions to clients and brokers who value our expertise, analytics and customer service offerings.\nWe aim to complement our underwriting results with a non-traditional investment approach in order to achieve higher rates of return over the long term than reinsurance companies that exclusively employ more traditional investment strategies. Our investment portfolio is managed according to a value-oriented philosophy, in which our investment advisor takes long positions in perceived undervalued securities and short positions in perceived overvalued securities.\nBecause we seek to capitalize on favorable market conditions and opportunities, period-to-period comparisons of our underwriting results may not be meaningful. Also, our historical investment results are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Due to the nature of our reinsurance and investment strategies, our operating results will likely fluctuate from period to period.\nThe Company's subsidiaries hold an A.M. Best Financial Strength Rating of A- (Excellent) with a negative outlook.\nOutlook and Trends\nCOVID-19 has created an unusually high level of uncertainty in the global reinsurance market. While we believe that our aggregate exposure to the pandemic is small compared to other industry participants, the impact of the pandemic and related risks could harm our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. For a further discussion of risks associated with COVID-19, see Risks Relating to our Business\u201d in Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nWhile the COVID-19 uncertainty has caused reserving challenges throughout the industry, it has also led to underwriting opportunities. The lack of clarity that we face is impacting the insurance and reinsurance market as a whole on a significantly larger scale. As reinsurers' reserves must accommodate a wide range of loss estimates, they could have less capital to deploy to new underwriting opportunities. We have already seen widespread pricing improvements, and this dynamic may be a significant driver of the increases.\nAdding to the reduction in capital was the unusually high frequency of loss events in 2020. Putting aside COVID-19, 2020 was the fifth costliest year in history regarding the impact of natural and human-made catastrophes on the insurance industry. While investors have injected new capital into the industry, we believe that this new capital represents a small portion of what has been lost or encumbered.\nCompared to most of our competitors, we are small and have low overhead expenses. We believe that our current expense efficiency, agility, and existing relationships have provided support to our competitive position and enable us to participate in lines of business that fit within our strategy. However, the current size of our capital base may reduce the number of high-quality underwriting opportunities that brokers refer to us. Additionally, a prolonged negative outlook from A.M. Best or an A.M. Best revision to our subsidiaries' ratings below A- (Excellent) may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategy. See Risks Relating to our Business\u201d in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOur growing Innovations business is increasing in importance as a source of attractive and lasting underwriting opportunities. Our Innovations partnerships generally enable us to add value to the relationship in multiple ways: as a strategic partner, a provider of risk capacity, and an investor. Investor interest in later-stage InsurTechs\u201d has surged in 2020, a development that is well-suited to our early-stage investment strategy.\nJanuary 1 is a key renewal date for the global reinsurance industry, and, as noted earlier, in 2021 we have seen improved rates in most of the classes of business we write. This hardening market enabled us to selectively expand our specialty book while taking advantage of improved rates. Our in-force portfolio reflects increased diversity across the classes of business we write and a lower concentration risk to individual counterparties. We are pleased with the progress we have made in growing and repositioning our underwriting book, and we expect that the newly formed Greenlight Re UK will help us secure further underwriting opportunities in the future.\nLink to Table of Contents\nSegments\nWe have one operating segment, Property & Casualty reinsurance, and we analyze our business based on the following categories:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Property </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Casualty </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Other </td> </tr>\n</table>\nProperty business covers automobile physical damage, personal lines (including homeowners' insurance) and commercial lines exposures. Property business includes both catastrophe as well as non-catastrophe coverage. We expect catastrophe business to make up a small proportion of our property business.\nCasualty business covers general liability, motor liability, professional liability and workers' compensation exposures. The Company's multi-line business relates predominantly to casualty reinsurance and as such all multi-line business is included within the casualty category. Casualty business generally has losses reported and paid over a longer period of time than property business.\nOther business covers accident and health, financial lines (including transactional liability, mortgage insurance, surety and trade credit), marine, energy, and to a lesser extent, other specialty business such as aviation, crop, cyber, political and terrorism exposures.\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues from two principal sources:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>premiums from reinsurance on property and casualty business assumed; and </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>income from investments. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognize premiums written as revenues, net of any applicable underlying reinsurance coverage, over the term of the related policy or contract. Depending on the contract structure, the earnings period could be the same as the reinsurance contract, or based on the terms of the underlying insurance policies.\nIncome from our investments is primarily composed of:\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>income (or loss) generated from our investment in SILP;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>gains (or losses) from our other investments including Innovations and an investment accounted for as equity method investment;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>interest income from money market funds; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>interest income and gains (or losses) from promissory notes receivable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, we may from time to time derive other income from gains on deposit accounted contracts, fees generated from advisory services and fees relating to overrides, profit commissions and the contractual fees upon early termination of contracts.\nExpenses\nOur expenses consist primarily of the following:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>underwriting losses and loss adjustment expenses; </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>acquisition costs; </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>general and administrative expenses; </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>interest expense; and </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>investment-related expenses. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe extent of our loss and LAE is a function of the amount and type of reinsurance contracts we write and the loss experience of the underlying coverage. As described below, loss and loss adjustment expenses include an actuarially determined estimate of losses incurred, including losses incurred during the period and changes in estimates from prior periods. The period over which we pay loss and LAE reserves depends on the nature of the coverage provided and generally extends over a period of multiple years.\nAcquisition costs consist primarily of brokerage fees, ceding commissions, premium taxes, profit commissions, letters of credit and trust fees, and federal excise taxes. We amortize deferred acquisition costs relating to successfully bound reinsurance contracts over the related contract term.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits and related costs, including costs associated with our incentive compensation plan, bonuses and stock compensation expenses. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees, travel and entertainment, information technology, rent and other general operating costs. General and administrative expenses reported on our consolidated statements of operations include both underwriting and corporate expenses.\nFor stock option expenses, we calculate compensation cost using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognize the associated expense over the stock options' vesting periods, which vary and have historically ranged from zero to six years. For restricted stock awards and restricted stock units with only service conditions, we calculate compensation cost using the grant date fair value of each award and recognize the associated expense of the stock awards over their vesting periods, which typically range from one to three years. For restricted stock awards that include both service and performance conditions, we recognize the associated expense when we determine that it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved.\nInterest expense consists of interest paid and accrued on senior convertible notes and the amortization of (i) issuance expenses and (ii) the note discount.\nInvestment-related expenses primarily consist of management fees and performance compensation paid to the investment advisor. We net these expenses against investment income (loss) in our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective and have required management to make assumptions and best estimates to determine reported values. If certain factors, including those described in Part I. Item IA. - Risk Factors,\u201d cause actual events or results to differ materially from our underlying assumptions or estimates, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We believe that the following accounting policies affect the more significant estimates used to prepare of our consolidated financial statements. We have summarized the descriptions below for clarity. We have included a more detailed description of our significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\nPremium Revenues and Risk Transfer. We record our property and casualty reinsurance premiums as premiums written based upon contract terms and information received from ceding companies and their brokers. Excess of loss reinsurance contracts typically state premiums as a percentage of the subject premiums written by the client, subject to a minimum and deposit premium. The minimum and deposit premium is generally based on an estimate of subject premiums expected to be written by the client during the contract term. The minimum and deposit premium is reported initially as premiums written and adjusted, if necessary, in subsequent periods once the actual subject premium is known.\nCertain contracts provide for reinstatement premiums in the event of a loss. Reinstatement premiums are written and earned when a triggering loss event occurs.\nOur client estimates gross premiums written at the contract's inception for each proportional contract we underwrite. We generally account for such premiums using our best estimates and then adjust our estimates based on our client's actual reports and based on our expectations of industry developments. As the contract progresses, we monitor actual premiums received in conjunction with the client's correspondence to refine our estimate. Variances from initial gross premiums written estimates are generally greater for proportional contracts than for non-proportional contracts. We earn premiums on proportional contracts over the risk coverage period. Unearned premiums represent the unexpired portion of reinsurance provided.\nAt the inception of each of our reinsurance contracts, we receive premium estimates from the client, which, we use in conjunction with historical and and industry data to estimate what we believe will be the ultimate premium payable under each contract. We receive actual premiums written by each client as the client reports the actual results of the underlying insurance\nLink to Table of Contents\nwritings to us monthly or quarterly (depending on the contract). We book the actual premiums written when we receive them from our client. Each reporting period we estimate the premiums written for stub periods that have not yet been reported to us by the client. For example, at year-end we may have to estimate December premiums ceded under certain contracts since the client may not be required to report the actual results to us until after we have issued our audited consolidated financial statements. Typically, we only use premium estimates for unreported stub periods, which account for a small percentage of our total premiums written.\nWe confirm the accuracy and completeness of premiums reported by our clients by reviewing the client's statutory filings or performing an audit of the client under the contract terms. Discrepancies between premiums ceded and reported under a contract are, in our experience, rare. To date, we have not had any material difference in premiums reported by a client that required a formal dispute resolution process.\nAssessing whether a reinsurance contract meets the conditions for risk transfer requires judgment. The determination of risk transfer is critical to reporting premiums written and is based, in part, on the use of actuarial and pricing models and assumptions. If we determine that a reinsurance contract does not transfer sufficient risk to merit reinsurance accounting treatment, the premium we receive is reported as a deposit liability. Similarly, we report the premium we pay as a deposit asset for ceded contracts that do not transfer sufficient risk to merit reinsurance accounting. Any gains or losses on deposit accounted contracts are calculated using the interest method and recorded in the consolidated statements of operations under the caption Other income (expense).\u201d\nInvestments. We carry our investment in SILP at fair value, based on the most recent net asset value obtained from SILP's third-party administrator. The caption Other investments\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets includes private and unlisted equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. We determine these private equity securities' carrying value based on the original cost, reviewed for impairment and any subsequent changes in the valuation based on any recent observable transactions. We determine realized gains and losses from other investments based on specific identification method (by reference to cost or amortized cost, as appropriate). These gains and losses are included in the captions Net investment income (loss)\u201d in the consolidated statements of operations.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves.The process of estimating our loss and LAE reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment and our estimates as of any given date are inherently uncertain. Estimating loss and LAE reserves requires us to make assumptions regarding reporting and development patterns, frequency and severity trends, claims settlement practices, potential changes in legal environments, inflation, loss amplification, foreign exchange movements and other factors. These estimates and judgments are based on numerous considerations and are often revised as: (i) we receive changes in loss amounts reported by ceding companies and brokers; (ii) we obtain additional information, experience or other data; (iii) we develop new or improved methodologies; or (iv) we observe changes in the legal environment.\nOur loss and LAE reserves relating to short-tail property risks are typically reported to us and settled more promptly than those relating to our long-tail risks. However, the timeliness of loss reporting can be affected by such factors as the nature of the event causing the loss, the location of the loss, whether the loss is from policies in force with primary insurers or with reinsurers and where our exposure falls within the cedent's overall reinsurance program.\nOur loss and LAE reserves are composed of case reserves (which are based on claims that have been reported to us) and IBNR reserves.\nWe determine case reserve estimates based on loss reports received. We determine our IBNR reserve estimates using various actuarial methods as well as a combination of our own historical and current loss experience, insurance industry loss experience, assessments of pricing adequacy trends and our professional judgment. In estimating our IBNR reserve, we project our estimated ultimate loss and LAE reserves and then subtract paid claims and case reserves to arrive at our IBNR reserve.\nThe nature and extent of our judgment in the reserving process depend in part upon the type of business. Some of our property treaty reinsurance contracts represent business with both a low frequency of claims occurrence and a high potential severity of loss, such as claims arising from natural catastrophes. Given the high-severity, low-frequency nature of these events, the losses typically generated by them do not lend themselves to traditional actuarial reserving methods, such as statistical calculations of a range of estimates surrounding the best point estimate of our loss and LAE reserves. Therefore, our reserving approach for this type of business estimates the ultimate cost associated with a single loss event rather than analyzing the historical development patterns of past losses as a means of estimating the ultimate losses for an entire accident year. We estimate our reserves for these large events on a contract-by-contract basis by reviewing policies with known or potential exposure to a particular loss event.\nLink to Table of Contents\nFor non-catastrophe losses, we often apply trend-based actuarial methodologies in setting reserves, including paid and incurred loss development, Bornheutter-Ferguson, and frequency and severity techniques. We also utilize industry loss ratio and development pattern information in conjunction with our own experience. The weight given to a particular method will depend on many factors, including the homogeneity within the class of business, the volume of losses, the maturity of the accident year, and the length of the expected development tail. For example, development methods rely on reported losses, while expected loss ratio methods typically rely on expectations established before notification of loss. Therefore, as an accident year matures, we may migrate from an expected loss ratio method to an incurred development method.\nReserving can prove especially difficult should a significant loss occur near the end of a financial reporting period, particularly if the loss involves a catastrophic event. These factors further contribute to the degree of uncertainty in our reserving process.\nAs a predominantly broker-market reinsurer for both excess-of-loss and proportional contracts, we must rely on loss information reported to brokers by primary insurers who, in turn, must estimate their losses at the policy level, often based on incomplete and changing information. The information we receive varies by cedent and may include paid losses, estimated case reserves and an estimated provision for IBNR reserves. Reserving practices and data reporting quality vary among ceding companies, which adds further uncertainty to our estimation of ultimate losses. The nature and extent of information received from ceding companies and brokers also vary widely depending on the type of coverage, the contractual reporting terms (which are affected by market conditions and practices), and other factors. Due to the lack of standardization of the terms and conditions of reinsurance contracts, the wide variability of coverage provided to individual clients, and the tendency of those coverages to change rapidly in response to market conditions, we cannot always reliably measure the ongoing economic impact of such uncertainties and inconsistencies.\nTime lags are inherent in loss reporting, especially in the case of excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts. The combined characteristics of low claim frequency and high claim severity make the available data less useful for predicting ultimate losses. In the case of proportional contracts, we rely on an analysis of a cedent's historical experience, industry information, and the underwriters' professional judgment in estimating reserves for these contracts. We also utilize ultimate loss ratio forecasts when reported by cedents and brokers, which are ordinarily subject to three to six-month lags for proportional business. Due to the degree of reliance we place on ceding companies for claims reporting, our reserve estimates are highly dependent on ceding companies' judgment. Furthermore, during the loss settlement period, which may last several years, additional facts regarding individual claims and trends will often become known and case law may change, affecting ultimate expected losses.\nSince we rely on ceding company estimates of case and IBNR reserves in the process of establishing our loss and LAE reserves, we maintain procedures designed to mitigate the risk that such information is incomplete or inaccurate. These procedures may include: (i) comparisons of expected premiums to reported premiums, which helps us to identify delinquent client periodic reports; (ii) ceding company audits to identify inaccurate or incomplete reporting of claims and ensure that claims are actively and appropriately managed in line with agreed protocols and settlement authority limits; and (iii) underwriting reviews to ascertain that the losses ceded are covered as provided under the contract terms. Each subsequent year of loss experience with a given cedent also provides additional insight into the accuracy and timeliness of previously reported information. These procedures are incorporated in our internal controls and are regularly evaluated and amended as market conditions, risk factors, and unanticipated areas of exposure develop.\nWe monitor the development of our prior-year losses during subsequent calendar years by comparing the actual reported losses against previous estimates. The analysis of this loss development is an essential factor in the ongoing refinement of our reserving process's assumptions.\nEstimating loss reserves for our book of longer-tail casualty reinsurance business, which we write on proportional and non-proportional basis, involves further uncertainties. In addition to the uncertainties inherent in the reserving process referred to above, casualty business can be subject to longer reporting lags than property business, and claims often take several years to settle. During this period, additional factors and trends will be revealed and, as they become apparent, we may adjust our reserves. There is also the potential for the emergence of new types of losses within our casualty book. Therefore, any factors that extend the time until our cedents settle claims add uncertainty to the reserving process. Furthermore, determining the appropriate level of casualty reserves is largely dependent upon our view of premium rates at any given time. Therefore, overestimating the extent to which premium rates have increased (or decreased) can lead to an understatement (or overstatement) of loss reserves.\nThe uncertainties inherent in the reserving process, together with the potential for unforeseen developments, including changes in laws and the prevailing interpretation of policy terms, may result in our loss and LAE reserves being materially greater or less than the loss and LAE reserves we initially established. We reflect adjustments to our loss and LAE reserves in our financial results during the period in which they are determined. Changes to our prior year loss reserves will impact our\nLink to Table of Contents\ncurrent underwriting results by improving our results if the prior year reserves prove redundant or impairing our results if the prior year reserves prove insufficient.\nWe believe that our reserves for loss and LAE are sufficient to cover losses that fall within the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers based on the methodologies used to estimate those reserves. However, we can provide no assurance that actual losses will not (i) be less than or (ii) exceed our total established reserves.\nPlease refer to Notes 2 and 7 of our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed explanation of our loss reserving methodology and the loss development tables by accident year, respectively, as required under U.S. GAAP.\nBonus Accruals. Under the Company's bonus program, most employees' target bonuses consist of two components: a discretionary component based on a qualitative assessment of each employee's performance and a quantitative component based on the return on deployed equity ( RODE\u201d) for each underwriting year relating to reinsurance operations. The qualitative portion of an employee's annual bonus is accrued quarterly at each employee's pro rata target amount and updated to actual at year-end. We accrue the quantitative portion of each employee's annual bonus based on the expected RODE for each underwriting year. We then adjust this accrual for changes in the expected RODE and actual investment return each quarter until we have settled all losses, or the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors declares the underwriting year closed. We incorporate any subsequent changes to any open underwriting year's quantitative bonus into the following underwriting year. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approves all quantitative bonuses before their payment dates. The initial RODE calculation utilizes proprietary models which require significant estimation and judgment. Actual RODE may vary significantly from the expected RODE, and any adjustments to the quantitative bonus estimates, which may be material, are recorded in the period in which they are determined.\nShare-Based Payments. We have established a stock incentive plan for directors, employees and consultants. We recognize share-based compensation transactions using the fair value at the award's grant date. We calculate the compensation for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) based on the price of the Company's common shares at the grant date. We recognize the associated expense, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, over the vesting period and incorporate the probability of meeting any performance conditions. We estimate the forfeiture rate for restricted stock awards and RSUs based on our historical experience and our expectations of future forfeitures. The forfeiture rate reduces the unamortized grant date fair value of unvested outstanding restricted stock awards and RSUs and the associated stock compensation expense. As restricted shares and RSUs are forfeited, we reduce the number of outstanding restricted shares and RSUs and compare the remaining unamortized grant date fair value to the assumed forfeiture levels. We record true-up adjustments as deemed necessary. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we have assumed a forfeiture rate of 7.0% (2019: 7.0% and 2018: 7.0%) for restricted stock awards and RSUs granted.\nWe recognize the expense of share purchase options over the vesting period on a graded vesting basis. Determining the fair value of share option awards at the grant date requires significant estimation and judgment. We use an option-pricing model (Black-Scholes pricing model) to assist in calculating of fair value. We base the estimate of expected volatility on our Class A ordinary shares' daily historical trading data from the date that these shares commenced trading (May 24, 2007) to the grant date.\nIf actual results differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions, particularly concerning our estimation of volatility and forfeiture rates, share-based compensation expense, primarily relating to future share-based awards, could be materially impacted.\nKey Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures\nManagement uses certain key financial measures, some of which are not prescribed under U.S. GAAP rules and standards ( non-GAAP financial measures\u201d), to evaluate our financial performance, financial position and the change in shareholder value. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined in SEC Regulation G, is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented under U.S. GAAP. We believe that these measures, which may be calculated or defined differently by other companies, provide consistent and comparable metrics of our business performance to help shareholders understand performance trends and allow for a more thorough understanding of the Company's business. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined under U.S. GAAP. The key non-GAAP financial measures used in this report are:\n\u2022Basic book value per share;\n\u2022Fully diluted book value per share;\nLink to Table of Contents\n\u2022Adjusted combined ratio; and\n\u2022Net underwriting income (loss).\nThese non-GAAP measures are described below.\nBasic Book Value Per Share and Fully Diluted Book Value Per Share\nWe believe that long-term growth in fully diluted book value per share is the most relevant measure of our financial performance because it provides management and investors a yardstick to monitor the shareholder value generated. Fully diluted book value per share may also help our investors, shareholders and other interested parties form a basis of comparison with other companies within the property and casualty reinsurance industry.\nWe calculate basic book value per share based on ending shareholders' equity and aggregate of Class A and Class B Ordinary shares issued and outstanding, as well as all unvested restricted shares. Fully diluted book value per share represents basic book value per share combined with any dilutive impact of in-the-money stock options and RSUs issued and outstanding as of any period end. Fully diluted book value per share also includes the dilutive effect, if any, of ordinary shares to be issued upon conversion of the convertible notes. Basic book value per share and fully diluted book value per share should not be viewed as substitutes for the comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nOur primary financial goal is to increase fully diluted book value per share over the long term.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures basic and fully diluted book value per share to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> ($ in thousands, except per share and share amounts) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Numerator for basic and fully diluted book value per share: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total equity (U.S. GAAP) (numerator for basic and fully diluted book value per share) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>464,857 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>477,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>477,772 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Denominator for basic and fully diluted book value per share: (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ordinary shares issued and outstanding (denominator for basic book value per share) </td> <td>34,514,790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,994,110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,384,929 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: In-the-money stock options and RSUs issued and outstanding </td> <td>116,722 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,398 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Denominator for fully diluted book value per share </td> <td>34,631,512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,057,692 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,431,327 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic book value per share </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in basic book value per share ($) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.22) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9.13) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in basic book value per share (%) </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(41.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fully diluted book value per share </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in fully diluted book value per share ($) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.22) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9.12) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in fully diluted book value per share (%) </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(41.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) All unvested restricted shares, including those with performance conditions, are included in the basic\u201d and fully diluted\u201d denominators. As of December 31, 2020, the number of unvested restricted shares with performance conditions was 193,149 (December 31, 2019: 356,900, December 31, 2018: 30,660).\nAdjusted combined ratio\nCombined ratio\u201d is a commonly used measure in the property and casualty insurance industry, and is calculated using U.S. GAAP components. We use the combined ratio, as well as an adjusted combined ratio that excludes the impacts of certain items, to evaluate our underwriting performance. We believe this adjusted non-GAAP measure provides management and financial statement users with a better understanding of the factors influencing our underwriting results.\nIn calculating the adjusted combined ratio, we exclude underwriting losses attributable to (i) prior accident-year reserve development, (ii) catastrophe losses, and (iii) certain significant, infrequent loss events.\nLink to Table of Contents\n\u2022Prior accident-year reserve development, which can be favorable or unfavorable, represents changes in our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with loss events that occurred in prior years. We believe a discussion of current accident-year performance, which excludes prior accident-year reserve development, is helpful since it provides more insight into current underwriting performance.\n\u2022By their nature, catastrophe losses and other significant, infrequent loss events are not representative of the type of loss activity that we would expect to occur in every period. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has certain characteristics that are unlike those of any other event in recent history.\nWe believe an adjusted combined ratio that excludes the effects of items such as these aids in understanding the underlying trends and variability in our underwriting results that may be obscured by these items.\nThe following table reconciles the combined ratio to the adjusted combined ratio:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio </td> <td>100.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>106.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>102.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact on combined ratio of selected items: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior-year development </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Catastrophes </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COVID-19 </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted combined ratio </td> <td>96.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>97.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>97.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Underwriting Income (Loss)\nOne way that we evaluate the Company's underwriting performance is through the measurement of net underwriting income (loss). We do not use premiums written as a measure of performance. Net underwriting income (loss) is a performance measure used by management to measure the fundamentals underlying the Company's underwriting operations. We believe that the use of net underwriting income (loss) enables investors and other users of the Company's financial information to analyze our performance in a manner similar to how management analyzes performance. Management also believes that this measure follows industry practice and allows the users of financial information to compare the Company's performance with those of our industry peer group.\nNet underwriting income (loss) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes items used to calculate net income before taxes under U.S. GAAP. We calculate net underwriting income (loss) as net premiums earned, plus other income (expense) relating to reinsurance and deposit-accounted contracts, less net loss and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition costs, and underwriting expenses. The measure excludes, on a recurring basis: (1) investment income (loss); (2) other income (expense) not related to underwriting, including foreign exchange gains or losses and adjustments to the allowance for expected credit losses; (3) corporate general and administrative expenses; (4) interest expense and (5) income taxes. We exclude total investment income or loss and foreign exchange gains or losses as we believe these items are influenced by market conditions and other factors not related to underwriting decisions. We exclude corporate expenses because these expenses are generally fixed and not incremental to or directly related to our underwriting operations. We believe all of these amounts are largely independent of our underwriting process, and including them could hinder the analysis of trends in our underwriting operations. Net underwriting income (loss) should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income.\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe reconciliations of net underwriting income (loss) to income (loss) before income taxes (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) on a consolidated basis is shown below:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The increases in basic and fully diluted book value per share for the year ended December 31, 2020 were due primarily to (i) share repurchases executed, (ii) net income earned, and (iii) restricted shares forfeited during the year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the net income was $3.9 million, compared to a net loss attributable to the Company of $4.0 million reported for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe developments that most significantly affected our financial performance during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the equivalent 2019 period, are summarized below:\n\u2022Underwriting: The underwriting loss for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $1.6 million on net earned premiums of $455.4 million. By comparison, the underwriting loss for the same period in 2019 was $33.5 million on net earned premiums of $483.6 million, primarily resulting from adverse loss development on our private passenger automobile business.\nCatastrophe events during the year ended December 31, 2020, including Hurricane Laura, Isaias, and Sally, the Midwest derecho storms, and North American wildfires contributed $9.0 million to the underwriting loss. Additionally, COVID-19 contributed $7.1 million to the underwriting loss for the year ended December 31, 2020. By comparison, the catastrophe events during 2019, including Hurricane Dorian and Typhoons Faxai and Hagibis, contributed $17.4 million to the underwriting loss for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOur overall combined ratio was 100.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 106.9% during the same period in 2019.

This increase in workers' compensation premiums written was primarily due to an expanded relationship with an existing cedent and as a restructured and renewed contract that we recorded on a deposit accounting basis during the comparative period in 2019.

were attributable to the following:\n Increase (decrease) ($ in millions) Increase / (decrease) in loss ratio points Explanation Property $(23.4) (13.1)% The decrease in property losses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the equivalent 2019 period related primarily to: \u2022significant adverse loss development recognized during 2019, \u2022the non-renewal of certain motor contracts, and \u2022a lower level of losses reported on in-force motor contracts resulting from fewer motorists on the roads at peak traffic times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decreases in property losses were partially offset by: \u2022COVID-19 pandemic-related business interruption claims incurred on non-motor contracts, and \u2022catastrophe losses from hurricanes Laura, Isaias, and Sally, the Midwest derecho storms, and the North American wildfires during the year ended December 31, 2020. The property loss ratio decreased 13.1 percentage point during the year ended December 31 2020, over the equivalent 2019 period, primarily due to the reduced level of adverse prior year loss development. Casualty $(57.4) (9.7)% The decrease in casualty losses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the equivalent 2019 period related primarily to: \u2022significant adverse loss development recognized during 2019, \u2022favorable loss development on professional liability contracts, \u2022the non-renewal of certain motor contracts, \u2022a lower level of losses reported on in-force motor contracts resulting from fewer motorists on the roads at peak traffic times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the casualty losses incurred and loss ratio decreased for motor business, the losses incurred and loss ratio for multi-line business increased compared to the same period in 2019. This increase in multi-line losses was due primarily to (i) adverse loss development recognized during 2020 and (ii) COVID-19 pandemic related claims incurred on non-motor contracts. Overall, the reduced level of adverse prior year loss development recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 was the primary driver of the 9.7 percentage point decrease in the casualty loss ratio compared to the equivalent 2019 period. Other $30.2 9.8% The increase in Other\u201d losses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 over the comparable 2019 period was related primarily to loss reserves for mortgage contracts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Reductions in profit commissions we pay to cedents on these contracts significantly reduced the net financial impact of the increased loss reserves (also see Acquisitions Costs, Net\u201d below). To a lesser extent the increase in Other\u201d losses incurred was due to certain crop contracts reporting higher than expected losses. The mortgage and crop contracts contributed to the 9.8 percentage points increase in Other\u201d loss ratio during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the equivalent 2019 period. \nSee Part II, Item 7.

This unrealized gain is reflected in the caption Change in unrealized gains and losses\u201d in the table above which also includes unrealized gains on investment related to Innovations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, the gross investment return (loss) on our investments managed by DME Advisors (excluding investment advisor performance allocation) were composed of the following:\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long portfolio gains (losses) </td> <td>15.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>16.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short portfolio gains (losses) </td> <td>(13.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Macro gains (losses) </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and expenses 1\n</td> <td>(0.7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross investment return </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment return 1\n</td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Other income and expenses\u201d excludes performance compensation but includes management fees. Net investment return\u201d incorporates both of these amounts.\nWe post our investment returns on investments managed by DME Advisors monthly on our website (www.greenlightre.com).\nIncome Taxes\nWe are not obligated to pay taxes in the Cayman Islands on either income or capital gains. The Governor-In-Cabinet has granted us an exemption from any income taxes that may be imposed in the Cayman Islands for a period of 20 years, expiring on February 1, 2025.\nGRIL is incorporated in Ireland and is subject to the Irish corporation tax. We expect GRIL to be taxed at a 12.5% rate on its taxable trading income, and 25% on its non-trading income, if any.\nVerdant is incorporated in Delaware and is subject to taxes under the U.S. federal rates and regulations prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service. We expect Verdant's future taxable income to be taxed at a rate of 21%.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have included a gross deferred tax asset of $3.5 million (2019: $3.6 million) in the caption Other assets\u201d in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2020, a valuation allowance of $3.0 million (2019: $2.6 million) partially offset this gross deferred tax asset. Based on the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and the likelihood of generating sufficient taxable income to realize the future tax benefit, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the recorded deferred tax asset (net of the valuation allowance). The Company has not taken any other tax positions that we believe are subject to uncertainty or reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company, GRIL or Verdant.\nLink to Table of Contents\nRatio Analysis\nThe following table provides our underwriting ratios by line of business:\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Property </td> <td> </td> <td>Casualty </td> <td> </td> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Property </td> <td> </td> <td>Casualty </td> <td> </td> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss ratio </td> <td>69.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>71.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>83.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>74.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>82.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>81.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>73.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>80.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition cost ratio </td> <td>20.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Composite ratio </td> <td>90.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>98.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>98.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>101.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>105.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>105.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>104.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Condition\nTotal investments\nThe total investments reported in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020, was $196.2 million, compared to $256.4 million as of December 31, 2019, a decrease of $60.2 million, or 23.5%. The decrease was primarily related to withdrawals from SILP for claim payments, funding collateral for our cedents and posting Funds at Lloyd's to support the reinsurance contracts with Lloyd's syndicates. We include the Funds at Lloyd's in the caption Reinsurance balances receivable\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets. The decrease was partially offset by investment income from our investment in SILP and an increase in the valuation of investments related to Innovations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 94.0% of SILP's investments were valued based on quoted prices in actively traded markets (Level 1), 2.2% was composed of instruments valued based on observable inputs other than quoted prices (Level 2), and 0.8% was composed of instruments valued based on non-observable inputs (Level 3). As of December 31, 2020, 3.0% of SILP's investments were private equity funds valued using the funds' net asset values as a practical expedient.\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents\nWe use our restricted cash and cash equivalents for funding trusts and letters of credits issued to our ceding insurers. Our restricted cash increased by $3.3 million, or 0.4%, from $742.1 million as of December 31, 2019, to $745.4 million, as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to a net increase in collateral held in trusts by our ceding insurers.\nReinsurance balances receivable\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, reinsurance balances receivable increased by $99.8 million, or 43.3%, to $330.2 million from $230.4 million, as of December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily related to Funds at Lloyd's to support the reinsurance contracts with Lloyd's syndicates. To a lesser extent, the increase related to premiums written and not yet collected from cedents on new and renewed contracts.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves; Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Recoverable\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and we do not have previous loss experience on which to base estimates for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves related to this pandemic. See Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for assumptions used in our loss estimates relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Losses in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic subsequent to December 31, 2020 will be reflected in the periods in which those losses are incurred.\nLink to Table of Contents\nReserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses were composed of the following:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Case\nReserves </td> <td> </td> <td>IBNR </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Case\nReserves </td> <td> </td> <td>IBNR </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,833 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,476 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Casualty </td> <td>138,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>206,152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>344,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>152,049 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>204,574 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>356,623 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>12,540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,542 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,489 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>176,805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>317,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>494,179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>252,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>470,588 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the total gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves increased by $23.6 million, or 5.0% to $494.2 million from $470.6 million as of December 31, 2019. See Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of changes in outstanding loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and for a description of prior period loss developments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the total loss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable decreased by $10.7 million, or 38.8%, to $16.9 million from $27.5 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease primarily related to losses recovered relating to retroceded private passenger automobile contracts that were not renewed during 2019. See Note 8 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the credit risk associated with our retrocessionaires.\nFor most of the contracts we write, our risk exposure is limited by defined limits of liability. Once each contract's limit of liability has been reached, we have no further exposure to additional losses from that contract. However, certain contracts, particularly quota share contracts that relate to first-dollar exposure, may not contain aggregate limits.\nOur property business, and to a lesser extent our casualty and other business, incorporate contracts that contain natural peril loss exposure. We estimate catastrophe loss exposure in terms of the PML. We anticipate that the PML will vary from period to period depending upon the modeled simulated losses and the composition of the in-force book of business. The projected severity levels are described in terms of a 1-in-250 year return period. The 1-in-250 year return period PML means that we believe there is a 0.4% chance in any given year that an occurrence of a natural catastrophe will lead to losses exceeding the stated estimate. In other words, it corresponds to a 99.6% probability that the loss from an event will fall below the indicated PML.\nPMLs are estimates and as a result, we cannot provide any assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event PML. The PML estimate incorporates all significant exposure from our reinsurance operations, including coverage for property, marine and energy, motor and catastrophe workers' compensation.\nAs of January 1, 2021, our estimated PML exposure (net of retrocession and reinstatement premiums) at a 1-in-250 year return period for a single event and in aggregate was $86.8 million and $109.6 million, respectively. The following table provides the PML for single event loss exposure and aggregate loss exposure to natural peril losses for each of the peak zones as of January 1, 2021:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>January 1, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-in-250 year return period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Zone </td> <td> </td> <td>Single Event Loss </td> <td> </td> <td>Aggregate Loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States, Canada and the Caribbean </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>86,771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>99,613 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe </td> <td> </td> <td>44,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Japan </td> <td> </td> <td>39,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,570 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rest of the world </td> <td> </td> <td>48,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum </td> <td> </td> <td>86,771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109,574 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLink to Table of Contents\nTotal shareholders' equity\nTotal equity reported on the consolidated balance sheet decreased by $12.3 million to $464.9 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $477.2 million as of December 31, 2019. Retained earnings increased primarily due to a net income of $3.9 million reported for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company repurchased 2.5 million Class A ordinary shares during the year ended December 31, 2020 resulting in a $17.8 million decrease in shareholders' equity. For details of other movements in shareholders' equity see Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity.\u201d\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nGreenlight Capital Re is organized as a holding company with no operations of its own. As a holding company, Greenlight Capital Re has minimal continuing cash needs, most of which are related to the payment of administrative expenses and interest expense. All of our underwriting operations are conducted through our wholly-owned reinsurance subsidiaries, Greenlight Re and GRIL, which underwrite property and casualty reinsurance. There are restrictions on each of Greenlight Re's and GRIL's ability to pay dividends, which are described in more detail below. It is our current policy to retain earnings to support the growth of our business. We currently do not expect to pay dividends on our ordinary shares.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Greenlight Re and GRIL were each rated A- (Excellent)\u201d with a negative outlook, by A.M. Best. On July 22, 2020, A.M. Best affirmed the A- (Excellent)\u201d ratings. The ratings reflect A.M. Best's opinion of our reinsurance subsidiaries' financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations and it is not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our Class A ordinary shares. If A.M. Best downgrades our ratings below A- (Excellent)\u201d or withdraws our rating, we could be severely limited or prevented from writing any new reinsurance contracts, which would significantly and negatively affect our business. Our A.M. Best ratings may be revised or revoked at the sole discretion of the rating agency.\nSources and Uses of Funds\nOur sources of funds consist primarily of premium receipts (net of brokerage and ceding commissions), investment income and other income. We use cash from our operations to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses, profit commissions, interest and general and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2020, all of our investable assets, excluding strategic investments and funds required for business operations and for capital risk management, are invested by DME Advisors in SILP, subject to our investment guidelines. We have the ability to redeem funds from SILP at any time for operational purposes by providing three days' notice to the general partner. As of December 31, 2020, the majority of SILP's long investments were composed of cash and cash equivalents, and publicly-traded equity securities, which can be readily liquidated to meet our redemption requests. We record all investment income (loss), including any changes in the net asset value of SILP, and any unrealized gains and losses, in our consolidated statements of operations for each reporting period.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, the net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $(91.3) million and $1.6 million, respectively. The net cash provided by (used in) our underwriting activities and for payment of corporate expenses was $(94.9) million and $(9.6) million for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Generally, if the premiums collected exceed claim payments within a given period, we generate cash from our underwriting activities. Our underwriting activities represented a net use of cash for the year ended December 31, 2020, as the losses we paid exceeded the premiums we collected. The cash used in, and generated from underwriting activities may vary significantly from period to period depending on the underwriting opportunities available and claims submitted to us by our cedents.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our investing activities provided cash of $95.6 million. The source of cash was primarily net withdrawals from SILP which were used to pay losses, provide support for the Lloyds syndicated business, and fund collateral required by our ceding insurers. By comparison, for the same period in 2019, our investing activities provided cash of $63.3 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we believe we have sufficient cash flow from operating and investing activities to meet our foreseeable liquidity requirements. We expect that our operational needs for liquidity will not be materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and will be met by cash, funds generated from underwriting activities and investment income, including withdrawals from SILP, if necessary. As of December 31, 2020, we expect to fund our operations for the next twelve months from operating and investing cash flows. Additionally, during 2021, we expect the release of collateral held by certain cedents as the exposure relating to those contracts has decreased.\nLink to Table of Contents\nWe may explore various financing alternatives, including capital raising alternatives, to fund our business strategy, improve our capital structure, increase surplus, pay claims or make acquisitions. We can provide no assurances that any such transactions will occur or, if so, as to the terms of such transactions.\nAlthough GLRE is not subject to any significant legal prohibitions on the payment of dividends, Greenlight Re and GRIL are each subject to regulatory minimum capital requirements and regulatory constraints that affect their ability to pay dividends to GLRE. In addition, any dividend payment would have to be approved by the relevant regulatory authorities prior to payment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received regulatory approval for a return of $15.0 million of Greenlight Re's share premium to GLRE to facilitate the share repurchases. In October 2020, we received regulatory approval for return of up to $25.0 million of Greenlight Re's share premium to GLRE in order to provide additional capital to GRIL. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we used $17.8 million to repurchase 2.5 million Class A ordinary shares. As of December 31, 2020, Greenlight Re and GRIL both exceeded the regulatory minimum capital requirements.\nLetters of Credit and Trust Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, neither Greenlight Re nor GRIL was licensed or admitted as a reinsurer in any jurisdiction other than the Cayman Islands and the European Economic Area, respectively. Because many jurisdictions do not permit domestic insurance companies to take credit on their statutory financial statements for loss recoveries or ceded unearned premiums unless appropriate measures are in place for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non-admitted insurers, we anticipate that all of our U.S. clients and some of our non-U.S. clients will require us to provide collateral through funds withheld, trust arrangements, letters of credit or a combination thereof.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had one (2019: one) letter of credit facility available with an aggregate capacity of $275.0 million (2019: $400.0 million). See Note 15 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for details on the letter of credit facility. We provide collateral to cedents in the form of letters of credit and trust arrangements. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of collateral provided to cedents under such arrangements was $743.0 million (2019: $733.2 million). As of December 31, 2020, the letters of credit and trust accounts were secured by restricted cash and cash equivalents with a total fair value of $745.4 million (2019: $742.1 million).\nThe letter of credit facility contains customary events of default and restrictive covenants, including but not limited to, limitations on liens on collateral, transactions with affiliates, mergers and sales of assets, as well as solvency and maintenance of certain minimum pledged equity requirements, and restricts issuance of any debt without the consent of the letter of credit provider. Additionally, if an event of default exists, as defined in the letter of credit facility, Greenlight Re would be prohibited from paying dividends to its parent company. The Company was in compliance with all the covenants of this facility as of December 31, 2020.\nCapital\nOur capital structure currently consists of senior convertible notes and equity issued in two classes of ordinary shares. We expect that the existing capital base and internally generated funds will be sufficient to implement our business strategy for the foreseeable future. Consequently, we do not presently anticipate that we will incur any additional material indebtedness in the ordinary course of our business. However, in order to provide us with flexibility and timely access to public capital markets should we require additional capital for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes, we have filed a Form S-3 registration statement, which expires in July 2021. In addition, as noted above, we may explore various financing alternatives, although there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms when needed or desired. We did not make any significant commitments for capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn March 26, 2020, the Board of Directors extended the share repurchase plan to June 30, 2021 and increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased to 5.0 million Class A ordinary shares or securities convertible into Class A ordinary shares in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or Rule 10b5-1 stock trading plans. In addition, the Board of Directors also authorized the Company to repurchase up to $25.0 million aggregate face amount of the Company's 4.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the Notes\u201d) in privately negotiated transactions, in open market repurchases or pursuant to one more tender offers. The Company is not required to repurchase any of the Class A ordinary shares or the Notes and the repurchase plans may be modified, suspended or terminated at the election of our Board of Directors at any time without prior notice. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 2.5 million Class A ordinary shares were repurchased by the Company. As of December 31, 2020, 2.5 million Class A ordinary shares and $25.0 million of the Notes, remained available for repurchase under the repurchase plans.\nLink to Table of Contents\nOn October 29, 2020, our shareholders approved an amendment to our stock incentive plan to increase the number of Class A ordinary shares available for issuance by 3.0 million shares from 5.0 million to 8.0 million shares.

( Verdant\u201d), unless the context dictates otherwise. References to our Ordinary Shares\u201d refers collectively to our Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which appear elsewhere in this filing.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nLink to Table of Contents\nWe have omitted discussion of the earliest of the three years covered by our consolidated financial statements presented in this report because that disclosure was already included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2020. You are encouraged to reference Part II, Item 7, within that report, for a discussion of our financial condition and result of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nGeneral\nWe are a global specialty property and casualty reinsurer, headquartered in the Cayman Islands, with a reinsurance and investment strategy that we believe differentiates us from most of our competitors. Our goal is to build long-term shareholder value by providing risk management products and services to the insurance, reinsurance and other risk marketplaces. We focus on delivering risk solutions to clients and brokers who value our expertise, analytics and customer service offerings.\nWe aim to complement our underwriting results with a non-traditional investment approach in order to achieve higher rates of return over the long term than reinsurance companies that exclusively employ more traditional investment strategies. Our investment portfolio is managed according to a value-oriented philosophy, in which our investment advisor takes long positions in perceived undervalued securities and short positions in perceived overvalued securities.\nBecause we seek to capitalize on favorable market conditions and opportunities, period-to-period comparisons of our underwriting results may not be meaningful. Also, our historical investment results are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Due to the nature of our reinsurance and investment strategies, our operating results will likely fluctuate from period to period.\nThe Company's subsidiaries hold an A.M. Best Financial Strength Rating of A- (Excellent) with a negative outlook.\nOutlook and Trends\nCOVID-19 has created an unusually high level of uncertainty in the global reinsurance market. While we believe that our aggregate exposure to the pandemic is small compared to other industry participants, the impact of the pandemic and related risks could harm our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. For a further discussion of risks associated with COVID-19, see Risks Relating to our Business\u201d in Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nWhile the COVID-19 uncertainty has caused reserving challenges throughout the industry, it has also led to underwriting opportunities. The lack of clarity that we face is impacting the insurance and reinsurance market as a whole on a significantly larger scale. As reinsurers' reserves must accommodate a wide range of loss estimates, they could have less capital to deploy to new underwriting opportunities. We have already seen widespread pricing improvements, and this dynamic may be a significant driver of the increases.\nAdding to the reduction in capital was the unusually high frequency of loss events in 2020. Putting aside COVID-19, 2020 was the fifth costliest year in history regarding the impact of natural and human-made catastrophes on the insurance industry. While investors have injected new capital into the industry, we believe that this new capital represents a small portion of what has been lost or encumbered.\nCompared to most of our competitors, we are small and have low overhead expenses. We believe that our current expense efficiency, agility, and existing relationships have provided support to our competitive position and enable us to participate in lines of business that fit within our strategy. However, the current size of our capital base may reduce the number of high-quality underwriting opportunities that brokers refer to us. Additionally, a prolonged negative outlook from A.M. Best or an A.M. Best revision to our subsidiaries' ratings below A- (Excellent) may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategy. See Risks Relating to our Business\u201d in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOur growing Innovations business is increasing in importance as a source of attractive and lasting underwriting opportunities. Our Innovations partnerships generally enable us to add value to the relationship in multiple ways: as a strategic partner, a provider of risk capacity, and an investor. Investor interest in later-stage InsurTechs\u201d has surged in 2020, a development that is well-suited to our early-stage investment strategy.\nJanuary 1 is a key renewal date for the global reinsurance industry, and, as noted earlier, in 2021 we have seen improved rates in most of the classes of business we write. This hardening market enabled us to selectively expand our specialty book while taking advantage of improved rates. Our in-force portfolio reflects increased diversity across the classes of business we write and a lower concentration risk to individual counterparties. We are pleased with the progress we have made in growing and repositioning our underwriting book, and we expect that the newly formed Greenlight Re UK will help us secure further underwriting opportunities in the future.\nLink to Table of Contents\nSegments\nWe have one operating segment, Property & Casualty reinsurance, and we analyze our business based on the following categories:\n\nProperty business covers automobile physical damage, personal lines (including homeowners' insurance) and commercial lines exposures. Property business includes both catastrophe as well as non-catastrophe coverage. We expect catastrophe business to make up a small proportion of our property business.\nCasualty business covers general liability, motor liability, professional liability and workers' compensation exposures. The Company's multi-line business relates predominantly to casualty reinsurance and as such all multi-line business is included within the casualty category. Casualty business generally has losses reported and paid over a longer period of time than property business.\nOther business covers accident and health, financial lines (including transactional liability, mortgage insurance, surety and trade credit), marine, energy, and to a lesser extent, other specialty business such as aviation, crop, cyber, political and terrorism exposures.\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues from two principal sources:\n\nWe recognize premiums written as revenues, net of any applicable underlying reinsurance coverage, over the term of the related policy or contract. Depending on the contract structure, the earnings period could be the same as the reinsurance contract, or based on the terms of the underlying insurance policies.\nIncome from our investments is primarily composed of:\n\nIn addition, we may from time to time derive other income from gains on deposit accounted contracts, fees generated from advisory services and fees relating to overrides, profit commissions and the contractual fees upon early termination of contracts.\nExpenses\nOur expenses consist primarily of the following:\n\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe extent of our loss and LAE is a function of the amount and type of reinsurance contracts we write and the loss experience of the underlying coverage. As described below, loss and loss adjustment expenses include an actuarially determined estimate of losses incurred, including losses incurred during the period and changes in estimates from prior periods. The period over which we pay loss and LAE reserves depends on the nature of the coverage provided and generally extends over a period of multiple years.\nAcquisition costs consist primarily of brokerage fees, ceding commissions, premium taxes, profit commissions, letters of credit and trust fees, and federal excise taxes. We amortize deferred acquisition costs relating to successfully bound reinsurance contracts over the related contract term.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits and related costs, including costs associated with our incentive compensation plan, bonuses and stock compensation expenses. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees, travel and entertainment, information technology, rent and other general operating costs. General and administrative expenses reported on our consolidated statements of operations include both underwriting and corporate expenses.\nFor stock option expenses, we calculate compensation cost using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognize the associated expense over the stock options' vesting periods, which vary and have historically ranged from zero to six years. For restricted stock awards and restricted stock units with only service conditions, we calculate compensation cost using the grant date fair value of each award and recognize the associated expense of the stock awards over their vesting periods, which typically range from one to three years. For restricted stock awards that include both service and performance conditions, we recognize the associated expense when we determine that it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved.\nInterest expense consists of interest paid and accrued on senior convertible notes and the amortization of (i) issuance expenses and (ii) the note discount.\nInvestment-related expenses primarily consist of management fees and performance compensation paid to the investment advisor. We net these expenses against investment income (loss) in our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective and have required management to make assumptions and best estimates to determine reported values. If certain factors, including those described in Part I. Item IA. - Risk Factors,\u201d cause actual events or results to differ materially from our underlying assumptions or estimates, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We believe that the following accounting policies affect the more significant estimates used to prepare of our consolidated financial statements. We have summarized the descriptions below for clarity. We have included a more detailed description of our significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\nPremium Revenues and Risk Transfer. We record our property and casualty reinsurance premiums as premiums written based upon contract terms and information received from ceding companies and their brokers. Excess of loss reinsurance contracts typically state premiums as a percentage of the subject premiums written by the client, subject to a minimum and deposit premium. The minimum and deposit premium is generally based on an estimate of subject premiums expected to be written by the client during the contract term. The minimum and deposit premium is reported initially as premiums written and adjusted, if necessary, in subsequent periods once the actual subject premium is known.\nCertain contracts provide for reinstatement premiums in the event of a loss. Reinstatement premiums are written and earned when a triggering loss event occurs.\nOur client estimates gross premiums written at the contract's inception for each proportional contract we underwrite. We generally account for such premiums using our best estimates and then adjust our estimates based on our client's actual reports and based on our expectations of industry developments. As the contract progresses, we monitor actual premiums received in conjunction with the client's correspondence to refine our estimate. Variances from initial gross premiums written estimates are generally greater for proportional contracts than for non-proportional contracts. We earn premiums on proportional contracts over the risk coverage period. Unearned premiums represent the unexpired portion of reinsurance provided.\nAt the inception of each of our reinsurance contracts, we receive premium estimates from the client, which, we use in conjunction with historical and and industry data to estimate what we believe will be the ultimate premium payable under each contract. We receive actual premiums written by each client as the client reports the actual results of the underlying insurance\nLink to Table of Contents\nwritings to us monthly or quarterly (depending on the contract). We book the actual premiums written when we receive them from our client. Each reporting period we estimate the premiums written for stub periods that have not yet been reported to us by the client. For example, at year-end we may have to estimate December premiums ceded under certain contracts since the client may not be required to report the actual results to us until after we have issued our audited consolidated financial statements. Typically, we only use premium estimates for unreported stub periods, which account for a small percentage of our total premiums written.\nWe confirm the accuracy and completeness of premiums reported by our clients by reviewing the client's statutory filings or performing an audit of the client under the contract terms. Discrepancies between premiums ceded and reported under a contract are, in our experience, rare. To date, we have not had any material difference in premiums reported by a client that required a formal dispute resolution process.\nAssessing whether a reinsurance contract meets the conditions for risk transfer requires judgment. The determination of risk transfer is critical to reporting premiums written and is based, in part, on the use of actuarial and pricing models and assumptions. If we determine that a reinsurance contract does not transfer sufficient risk to merit reinsurance accounting treatment, the premium we receive is reported as a deposit liability. Similarly, we report the premium we pay as a deposit asset for ceded contracts that do not transfer sufficient risk to merit reinsurance accounting. Any gains or losses on deposit accounted contracts are calculated using the interest method and recorded in the consolidated statements of operations under the caption Other income (expense).\u201d\nInvestments. We carry our investment in SILP at fair value, based on the most recent net asset value obtained from SILP's third-party administrator. The caption Other investments\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets includes private and unlisted equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. We determine these private equity securities' carrying value based on the original cost, reviewed for impairment and any subsequent changes in the valuation based on any recent observable transactions. We determine realized gains and losses from other investments based on specific identification method (by reference to cost or amortized cost, as appropriate). These gains and losses are included in the captions Net investment income (loss)\u201d in the consolidated statements of operations.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves.The process of estimating our loss and LAE reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment and our estimates as of any given date are inherently uncertain. Estimating loss and LAE reserves requires us to make assumptions regarding reporting and development patterns, frequency and severity trends, claims settlement practices, potential changes in legal environments, inflation, loss amplification, foreign exchange movements and other factors. These estimates and judgments are based on numerous considerations and are often revised as: (i) we receive changes in loss amounts reported by ceding companies and brokers; (ii) we obtain additional information, experience or other data; (iii) we develop new or improved methodologies; or (iv) we observe changes in the legal environment.\nOur loss and LAE reserves relating to short-tail property risks are typically reported to us and settled more promptly than those relating to our long-tail risks. However, the timeliness of loss reporting can be affected by such factors as the nature of the event causing the loss, the location of the loss, whether the loss is from policies in force with primary insurers or with reinsurers and where our exposure falls within the cedent's overall reinsurance program.\nOur loss and LAE reserves are composed of case reserves (which are based on claims that have been reported to us) and IBNR reserves.\nWe determine case reserve estimates based on loss reports received. We determine our IBNR reserve estimates using various actuarial methods as well as a combination of our own historical and current loss experience, insurance industry loss experience, assessments of pricing adequacy trends and our professional judgment. In estimating our IBNR reserve, we project our estimated ultimate loss and LAE reserves and then subtract paid claims and case reserves to arrive at our IBNR reserve.\nThe nature and extent of our judgment in the reserving process depend in part upon the type of business. Some of our property treaty reinsurance contracts represent business with both a low frequency of claims occurrence and a high potential severity of loss, such as claims arising from natural catastrophes. Given the high-severity, low-frequency nature of these events, the losses typically generated by them do not lend themselves to traditional actuarial reserving methods, such as statistical calculations of a range of estimates surrounding the best point estimate of our loss and LAE reserves. Therefore, our reserving approach for this type of business estimates the ultimate cost associated with a single loss event rather than analyzing the historical development patterns of past losses as a means of estimating the ultimate losses for an entire accident year. We estimate our reserves for these large events on a contract-by-contract basis by reviewing policies with known or potential exposure to a particular loss event.\nLink to Table of Contents\nFor non-catastrophe losses, we often apply trend-based actuarial methodologies in setting reserves, including paid and incurred loss development, Bornheutter-Ferguson, and frequency and severity techniques. We also utilize industry loss ratio and development pattern information in conjunction with our own experience. The weight given to a particular method will depend on many factors, including the homogeneity within the class of business, the volume of losses, the maturity of the accident year, and the length of the expected development tail. For example, development methods rely on reported losses, while expected loss ratio methods typically rely on expectations established before notification of loss. Therefore, as an accident year matures, we may migrate from an expected loss ratio method to an incurred development method.\nReserving can prove especially difficult should a significant loss occur near the end of a financial reporting period, particularly if the loss involves a catastrophic event. These factors further contribute to the degree of uncertainty in our reserving process.\nAs a predominantly broker-market reinsurer for both excess-of-loss and proportional contracts, we must rely on loss information reported to brokers by primary insurers who, in turn, must estimate their losses at the policy level, often based on incomplete and changing information. The information we receive varies by cedent and may include paid losses, estimated case reserves and an estimated provision for IBNR reserves. Reserving practices and data reporting quality vary among ceding companies, which adds further uncertainty to our estimation of ultimate losses. The nature and extent of information received from ceding companies and brokers also vary widely depending on the type of coverage, the contractual reporting terms (which are affected by market conditions and practices), and other factors. Due to the lack of standardization of the terms and conditions of reinsurance contracts, the wide variability of coverage provided to individual clients, and the tendency of those coverages to change rapidly in response to market conditions, we cannot always reliably measure the ongoing economic impact of such uncertainties and inconsistencies.\nTime lags are inherent in loss reporting, especially in the case of excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts. The combined characteristics of low claim frequency and high claim severity make the available data less useful for predicting ultimate losses. In the case of proportional contracts, we rely on an analysis of a cedent's historical experience, industry information, and the underwriters' professional judgment in estimating reserves for these contracts. We also utilize ultimate loss ratio forecasts when reported by cedents and brokers, which are ordinarily subject to three to six-month lags for proportional business. Due to the degree of reliance we place on ceding companies for claims reporting, our reserve estimates are highly dependent on ceding companies' judgment. Furthermore, during the loss settlement period, which may last several years, additional facts regarding individual claims and trends will often become known and case law may change, affecting ultimate expected losses.\nSince we rely on ceding company estimates of case and IBNR reserves in the process of establishing our loss and LAE reserves, we maintain procedures designed to mitigate the risk that such information is incomplete or inaccurate. These procedures may include: (i) comparisons of expected premiums to reported premiums, which helps us to identify delinquent client periodic reports; (ii) ceding company audits to identify inaccurate or incomplete reporting of claims and ensure that claims are actively and appropriately managed in line with agreed protocols and settlement authority limits; and (iii) underwriting reviews to ascertain that the losses ceded are covered as provided under the contract terms. Each subsequent year of loss experience with a given cedent also provides additional insight into the accuracy and timeliness of previously reported information. These procedures are incorporated in our internal controls and are regularly evaluated and amended as market conditions, risk factors, and unanticipated areas of exposure develop.\nWe monitor the development of our prior-year losses during subsequent calendar years by comparing the actual reported losses against previous estimates. The analysis of this loss development is an essential factor in the ongoing refinement of our reserving process's assumptions.\nEstimating loss reserves for our book of longer-tail casualty reinsurance business, which we write on proportional and non-proportional basis, involves further uncertainties. In addition to the uncertainties inherent in the reserving process referred to above, casualty business can be subject to longer reporting lags than property business, and claims often take several years to settle. During this period, additional factors and trends will be revealed and, as they become apparent, we may adjust our reserves. There is also the potential for the emergence of new types of losses within our casualty book. Therefore, any factors that extend the time until our cedents settle claims add uncertainty to the reserving process. Furthermore, determining the appropriate level of casualty reserves is largely dependent upon our view of premium rates at any given time. Therefore, overestimating the extent to which premium rates have increased (or decreased) can lead to an understatement (or overstatement) of loss reserves.\nThe uncertainties inherent in the reserving process, together with the potential for unforeseen developments, including changes in laws and the prevailing interpretation of policy terms, may result in our loss and LAE reserves being materially greater or less than the loss and LAE reserves we initially established. We reflect adjustments to our loss and LAE reserves in our financial results during the period in which they are determined. Changes to our prior year loss reserves will impact our\nLink to Table of Contents\ncurrent underwriting results by improving our results if the prior year reserves prove redundant or impairing our results if the prior year reserves prove insufficient.\nWe believe that our reserves for loss and LAE are sufficient to cover losses that fall within the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers based on the methodologies used to estimate those reserves. However, we can provide no assurance that actual losses will not (i) be less than or (ii) exceed our total established reserves.\nPlease refer to Notes 2 and 7 of our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed explanation of our loss reserving methodology and the loss development tables by accident year, respectively, as required under U.S. GAAP.\nBonus Accruals. Under the Company's bonus program, most employees' target bonuses consist of two components: a discretionary component based on a qualitative assessment of each employee's performance and a quantitative component based on the return on deployed equity ( RODE\u201d) for each underwriting year relating to reinsurance operations. The qualitative portion of an employee's annual bonus is accrued quarterly at each employee's pro rata target amount and updated to actual at year-end. We accrue the quantitative portion of each employee's annual bonus based on the expected RODE for each underwriting year. We then adjust this accrual for changes in the expected RODE and actual investment return each quarter until we have settled all losses, or the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors declares the underwriting year closed. We incorporate any subsequent changes to any open underwriting year's quantitative bonus into the following underwriting year. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approves all quantitative bonuses before their payment dates. The initial RODE calculation utilizes proprietary models which require significant estimation and judgment. Actual RODE may vary significantly from the expected RODE, and any adjustments to the quantitative bonus estimates, which may be material, are recorded in the period in which they are determined.\nShare-Based Payments. We have established a stock incentive plan for directors, employees and consultants. We recognize share-based compensation transactions using the fair value at the award's grant date. We calculate the compensation for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) based on the price of the Company's common shares at the grant date. We recognize the associated expense, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, over the vesting period and incorporate the probability of meeting any performance conditions. We estimate the forfeiture rate for restricted stock awards and RSUs based on our historical experience and our expectations of future forfeitures. The forfeiture rate reduces the unamortized grant date fair value of unvested outstanding restricted stock awards and RSUs and the associated stock compensation expense. As restricted shares and RSUs are forfeited, we reduce the number of outstanding restricted shares and RSUs and compare the remaining unamortized grant date fair value to the assumed forfeiture levels. We record true-up adjustments as deemed necessary. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we have assumed a forfeiture rate of 7.0% (2019: 7.0% and 2018: 7.0%) for restricted stock awards and RSUs granted.\nWe recognize the expense of share purchase options over the vesting period on a graded vesting basis. Determining the fair value of share option awards at the grant date requires significant estimation and judgment. We use an option-pricing model (Black-Scholes pricing model) to assist in calculating of fair value. We base the estimate of expected volatility on our Class A ordinary shares' daily historical trading data from the date that these shares commenced trading (May 24, 2007) to the grant date.\nIf actual results differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions, particularly concerning our estimation of volatility and forfeiture rates, share-based compensation expense, primarily relating to future share-based awards, could be materially impacted.\nKey Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures\nManagement uses certain key financial measures, some of which are not prescribed under U.S. GAAP rules and standards ( non-GAAP financial measures\u201d), to evaluate our financial performance, financial position and the change in shareholder value. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined in SEC Regulation G, is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented under U.S. GAAP. We believe that these measures, which may be calculated or defined differently by other companies, provide consistent and comparable metrics of our business performance to help shareholders understand performance trends and allow for a more thorough understanding of the Company's business. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined under U.S. GAAP. The key non-GAAP financial measures used in this report are:\n\u2022Basic book value per share;\n\u2022Fully diluted book value per share;\nLink to Table of Contents\n\u2022Adjusted combined ratio; and\n\u2022Net underwriting income (loss).\nThese non-GAAP measures are described below.\nBasic Book Value Per Share and Fully Diluted Book Value Per Share\nWe believe that long-term growth in fully diluted book value per share is the most relevant measure of our financial performance because it provides management and investors a yardstick to monitor the shareholder value generated. Fully diluted book value per share may also help our investors, shareholders and other interested parties form a basis of comparison with other companies within the property and casualty reinsurance industry.\nWe calculate basic book value per share based on ending shareholders' equity and aggregate of Class A and Class B Ordinary shares issued and outstanding, as well as all unvested restricted shares. Fully diluted book value per share represents basic book value per share combined with any dilutive impact of in-the-money stock options and RSUs issued and outstanding as of any period end. Fully diluted book value per share also includes the dilutive effect, if any, of ordinary shares to be issued upon conversion of the convertible notes. Basic book value per share and fully diluted book value per share should not be viewed as substitutes for the comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nOur primary financial goal is to increase fully diluted book value per share over the long term.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures basic and fully diluted book value per share to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\n\n(1) All unvested restricted shares, including those with performance conditions, are included in the basic\u201d and fully diluted\u201d denominators. As of December 31, 2020, the number of unvested restricted shares with performance conditions was 193,149 (December 31, 2019: 356,900, December 31, 2018: 30,660).\nAdjusted combined ratio\nCombined ratio\u201d is a commonly used measure in the property and casualty insurance industry, and is calculated using U.S. GAAP components. We use the combined ratio, as well as an adjusted combined ratio that excludes the impacts of certain items, to evaluate our underwriting performance. We believe this adjusted non-GAAP measure provides management and financial statement users with a better understanding of the factors influencing our underwriting results.\nIn calculating the adjusted combined ratio, we exclude underwriting losses attributable to (i) prior accident-year reserve development, (ii) catastrophe losses, and (iii) certain significant, infrequent loss events.\nLink to Table of Contents\n\u2022Prior accident-year reserve development, which can be favorable or unfavorable, represents changes in our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with loss events that occurred in prior years. We believe a discussion of current accident-year performance, which excludes prior accident-year reserve development, is helpful since it provides more insight into current underwriting performance.\n\u2022By their nature, catastrophe losses and other significant, infrequent loss events are not representative of the type of loss activity that we would expect to occur in every period. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has certain characteristics that are unlike those of any other event in recent history.\nWe believe an adjusted combined ratio that excludes the effects of items such as these aids in understanding the underlying trends and variability in our underwriting results that may be obscured by these items.\nThe following table reconciles the combined ratio to the adjusted combined ratio:\n\nNet Underwriting Income (Loss)\nOne way that we evaluate the Company's underwriting performance is through the measurement of net underwriting income (loss). We do not use premiums written as a measure of performance. Net underwriting income (loss) is a performance measure used by management to measure the fundamentals underlying the Company's underwriting operations. We believe that the use of net underwriting income (loss) enables investors and other users of the Company's financial information to analyze our performance in a manner similar to how management analyzes performance. Management also believes that this measure follows industry practice and allows the users of financial information to compare the Company's performance with those of our industry peer group.\nNet underwriting income (loss) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes items used to calculate net income before taxes under U.S. GAAP. We calculate net underwriting income (loss) as net premiums earned, plus other income (expense) relating to reinsurance and deposit-accounted contracts, less net loss and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition costs, and underwriting expenses. The measure excludes, on a recurring basis: (1) investment income (loss); (2) other income (expense) not related to underwriting, including foreign exchange gains or losses and adjustments to the allowance for expected credit losses; (3) corporate general and administrative expenses; (4) interest expense and (5) income taxes. We exclude total investment income or loss and foreign exchange gains or losses as we believe these items are influenced by market conditions and other factors not related to underwriting decisions. We exclude corporate expenses because these expenses are generally fixed and not incremental to or directly related to our underwriting operations. We believe all of these amounts are largely independent of our underwriting process, and including them could hinder the analysis of trends in our underwriting operations. Net underwriting income (loss) should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income.\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe reconciliations of net underwriting income (loss) to income (loss) before income taxes (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) on a consolidated basis is shown below:\n\nLink to Table of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe table below summarizes our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\n\n* The net adverse financial impact associated with changes in the estimate of losses incurred in prior years, which incorporates earned reinstatement premiums assumed and ceded, adjustments to assumed and ceded acquisition costs, and adjustments to deposit accounted contracts, was $3.7 million, $30.1 million, and $7.4 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nLink to Table of Contents\nYear ended 2020 compared to 2019\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the fully diluted book value per share increased by $0.54 per share, or 4.2%, to $13.42 per share from $12.88 per share on December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the basic book value per share increased by $0.57 per share, or 4.4%, to $13.47 per share from $12.90 per share on December 31, 2019. The increases in basic and fully diluted book value per share for the year ended December 31, 2020 were due primarily to (i) share repurchases executed, (ii) net income earned, and (iii) restricted shares forfeited during the year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the net income was $3.9 million, compared to a net loss attributable to the Company of $4.0 million reported for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe developments that most significantly affected our financial performance during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the equivalent 2019 period, are summarized below:\n\u2022Underwriting: The underwriting loss for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $1.6 million on net earned premiums of $455.4 million. By comparison, the underwriting loss for the same period in 2019 was $33.5 million on net earned premiums of $483.6 million, primarily resulting from adverse loss development on our private passenger automobile business.\nCatastrophe events during the year ended December 31, 2020, including Hurricane Laura, Isaias, and Sally, the Midwest derecho storms, and North American wildfires contributed $9.0 million to the underwriting loss. Additionally, COVID-19 contributed $7.1 million to the underwriting loss for the year ended December 31, 2020. By comparison, the catastrophe events during 2019, including Hurricane Dorian and Typhoons Faxai and Hagibis, contributed $17.4 million to the underwriting loss for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOur overall combined ratio was 100.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 106.9% during the same period in 2019. Excluding the impacts of prior year development, catastrophe events, and COVID-19, the adjusted combined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2020, was 96.0%, compared to 97.1% in 2019.\n\u2022Investments: Our total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $25.5 million compared to total investment income of $52.3 million reported during 2019. Investment income for the year ended December 31, 2020 included a) $4.4 million on our investment in SILP, b) $10.2 million gain on our Innovations and other strategic investments and c) $5.8 million gain on settlement of a note receivable.\nUnderwriting results\nWe analyze our business based on three categories: property\u201d, casualty\u201d, and other.\u201d\nGross Premiums Written\nDetails of gross premiums written are provided in the following table:\n\nAs a result of our underwriting philosophy, the total premiums we write, and the mix of premiums between property, casualty, and other business, may vary significantly from period to period depending on the market opportunities that we identify.\nLink to Table of Contents\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our gross premiums written decreased by $44.2 million, or 8.4%, compared to the same period in 2019. The changes in gross premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2020, were attributable to the following:\n\nPremiums Ceded\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, premiums ceded decreased by $46.4 million, or 95.3%, to $2.3 million compared to $48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the comparative period in 2019 we retroceded a portion of our overall exposure to an inward motor contract. The decrease in premiums ceded for the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily related to our decision not to renew the associated inward motor contract. In general, we use retrocessional coverage to manage our net portfolio exposure, leverage areas of expertise, and improve our strategic position in meeting clients' and brokers' needs.\nNet Premiums Written\nDetails of net premiums written are provided in the following table:\n\nThe movement in net premiums written resulted from the changes in gross premiums written and ceded during the periods.\nLink to Table of Contents\nNet Premiums Earned\nDetails of net premiums earned are provided in the following table:\n\nNet premiums earned are primarily a function of the amount and timing of net premiums written during the current and prior periods.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Incurred, Net\nDetails of net losses incurred are provided in the following table:\n\nThe below table summarizes the loss ratios for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019:\n\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe changes in net losses incurred and loss ratios during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, were attributable to the following:\n Increase (decrease) ($ in millions) Increase / (decrease) in loss ratio points Explanation Property $(23.4) (13.1)% The decrease in property losses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the equivalent 2019 period related primarily to: \u2022significant adverse loss development recognized during 2019, \u2022the non-renewal of certain motor contracts, and \u2022a lower level of losses reported on in-force motor contracts resulting from fewer motorists on the roads at peak traffic times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decreases in property losses were partially offset by: \u2022COVID-19 pandemic-related business interruption claims incurred on non-motor contracts, and \u2022catastrophe losses from hurricanes Laura, Isaias, and Sally, the Midwest derecho storms, and the North American wildfires during the year ended December 31, 2020. The property loss ratio decreased 13.1 percentage point during the year ended December 31 2020, over the equivalent 2019 period, primarily due to the reduced level of adverse prior year loss development. Casualty $(57.4) (9.7)% The decrease in casualty losses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the equivalent 2019 period related primarily to: \u2022significant adverse loss development recognized during 2019, \u2022favorable loss development on professional liability contracts, \u2022the non-renewal of certain motor contracts, \u2022a lower level of losses reported on in-force motor contracts resulting from fewer motorists on the roads at peak traffic times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the casualty losses incurred and loss ratio decreased for motor business, the losses incurred and loss ratio for multi-line business increased compared to the same period in 2019. This increase in multi-line losses was due primarily to (i) adverse loss development recognized during 2020 and (ii) COVID-19 pandemic related claims incurred on non-motor contracts. Overall, the reduced level of adverse prior year loss development recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 was the primary driver of the 9.7 percentage point decrease in the casualty loss ratio compared to the equivalent 2019 period. Other $30.2 9.8% The increase in Other\u201d losses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 over the comparable 2019 period was related primarily to loss reserves for mortgage contracts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Reductions in profit commissions we pay to cedents on these contracts significantly reduced the net financial impact of the increased loss reserves (also see Acquisitions Costs, Net\u201d below). To a lesser extent the increase in Other\u201d losses incurred was due to certain crop contracts reporting higher than expected losses. The mortgage and crop contracts contributed to the 9.8 percentage points increase in Other\u201d loss ratio during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the equivalent 2019 period. \nSee Part II, Item 7. Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates, Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\u201d and Note 7. LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES\u201d in our Notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our reserving techniques and prior year development of net claims and claim expenses.\nLink to Table of Contents\nAcquisition Costs, Net\nDetails of acquisition costs are provided in the following table.\n\nThe acquisition cost ratios for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, were as follows:\n\nThe changes in the acquisition cost ratios during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 were attributable to the following:\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nDetails of general and administrative expenses are provided in the following table:\nLink to Table of Contents\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, general and administrative expenses decreased by $3.4 million, or 11.5%, compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease was due primarily to lower personnel costs, including bonus and stock compensation expenses, and lower corporate expenses including legal and other professional fees compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Higher directors and officers insurance premiums partially offset the decrease in corporate expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, the general and administrative expenses included $2.5 million and $3.9 million, respectively, of expenses related to stock compensation granted to employees and directors.\nTotal Investment Income (Loss)\nTotal investment income (loss) incorporates (i) changes in the net asset value of our investment in SILP managed by DME Advisors, (ii) interest income earned on the restricted cash and cash equivalents pledged as collateral to our clients, and (iii) gains (or losses) and interest on our portfolio of strategic and Innovations investments, notes receivable and investments accounted for under the equity method. We expect our total investment income, including any change in the net asset value of our investment in SILP, to fluctuate from period to period.\nA summary of our total investment income (loss) is as follows:\n\nThe caption Income (loss) from investment in related party investment fund\u201d in the above table is net of management fees paid by SILP to DME Advisors and performance compensation, if any, allocated from the Company's investment in SILP to DME II. No performance compensation is allocated in periods of loss reported by SILP. For detailed breakdowns of management fees and performance compensation for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, please refer to Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, investment income, net of fees and expenses, resulted in a gain of 1.4% on the Investment Portfolio managed by DME Advisors, compared to a gain of 9.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The short portfolio lost 13.5%, while the long portfolio and macro positions gained 15.3% and 0.4%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the largest contributors to SILP's investment income were long positions in Green Brick Partners (GRBK), FuboTV (FUBO), and AerCap Holdings (AER). The largest detractor was a short position in Tesla (TSLA), and a basket of short positions in companies whose finances are believed to have been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the decrease in interest income compared to the equivalent period in 2019, related to lower interest rates offered by financial institutions on the restricted cash and cash equivalents pledged as collateral to our clients.\nLink to Table of Contents\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded net unrealized gains of $10.2 million on our portfolio of Innovations related investments. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we also recognized the following realized gains and losses:\n\u2022a $5.8 million gain on a note receivable settled above its carrying value; and\n\u2022a $15.0 million realized loss associated with a note receivable.\nThe $15.0 million realized loss noted above related to a note receivable against which we had recorded a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2019. As a result, when we realized this loss during 2020, we offset it with a $15.0 million unrealized gain during the same period. This unrealized gain is reflected in the caption Change in unrealized gains and losses\u201d in the table above which also includes unrealized gains on investment related to Innovations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, the gross investment return (loss) on our investments managed by DME Advisors (excluding investment advisor performance allocation) were composed of the following:\n\n1 Other income and expenses\u201d excludes performance compensation but includes management fees. Net investment return\u201d incorporates both of these amounts.\nWe post our investment returns on investments managed by DME Advisors monthly on our website (www.greenlightre.com).\nIncome Taxes\nWe are not obligated to pay taxes in the Cayman Islands on either income or capital gains. The Governor-In-Cabinet has granted us an exemption from any income taxes that may be imposed in the Cayman Islands for a period of 20 years, expiring on February 1, 2025.\nGRIL is incorporated in Ireland and is subject to the Irish corporation tax. We expect GRIL to be taxed at a 12.5% rate on its taxable trading income, and 25% on its non-trading income, if any.\nVerdant is incorporated in Delaware and is subject to taxes under the U.S. federal rates and regulations prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service. We expect Verdant's future taxable income to be taxed at a rate of 21%.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have included a gross deferred tax asset of $3.5 million (2019: $3.6 million) in the caption Other assets\u201d in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2020, a valuation allowance of $3.0 million (2019: $2.6 million) partially offset this gross deferred tax asset. Based on the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and the likelihood of generating sufficient taxable income to realize the future tax benefit, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the recorded deferred tax asset (net of the valuation allowance). The Company has not taken any other tax positions that we believe are subject to uncertainty or reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company, GRIL or Verdant.\nLink to Table of Contents\nRatio Analysis\nThe following table provides our underwriting ratios by line of business:\n\nFinancial Condition\nTotal investments\nThe total investments reported in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020, was $196.2 million, compared to $256.4 million as of December 31, 2019, a decrease of $60.2 million, or 23.5%. The decrease was primarily related to withdrawals from SILP for claim payments, funding collateral for our cedents and posting Funds at Lloyd's to support the reinsurance contracts with Lloyd's syndicates. We include the Funds at Lloyd's in the caption Reinsurance balances receivable\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets. The decrease was partially offset by investment income from our investment in SILP and an increase in the valuation of investments related to Innovations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 94.0% of SILP's investments were valued based on quoted prices in actively traded markets (Level 1), 2.2% was composed of instruments valued based on observable inputs other than quoted prices (Level 2), and 0.8% was composed of instruments valued based on non-observable inputs (Level 3). As of December 31, 2020, 3.0% of SILP's investments were private equity funds valued using the funds' net asset values as a practical expedient.\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents\nWe use our restricted cash and cash equivalents for funding trusts and letters of credits issued to our ceding insurers. Our restricted cash increased by $3.3 million, or 0.4%, from $742.1 million as of December 31, 2019, to $745.4 million, as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to a net increase in collateral held in trusts by our ceding insurers.\nReinsurance balances receivable\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, reinsurance balances receivable increased by $99.8 million, or 43.3%, to $330.2 million from $230.4 million, as of December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily related to Funds at Lloyd's to support the reinsurance contracts with Lloyd's syndicates. To a lesser extent, the increase related to premiums written and not yet collected from cedents on new and renewed contracts.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves; Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Recoverable\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and we do not have previous loss experience on which to base estimates for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves related to this pandemic. See Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for assumptions used in our loss estimates relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Losses in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic subsequent to December 31, 2020 will be reflected in the periods in which those losses are incurred.\nLink to Table of Contents\nReserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses were composed of the following:\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the total gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves increased by $23.6 million, or 5.0% to $494.2 million from $470.6 million as of December 31, 2019. See Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of changes in outstanding loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and for a description of prior period loss developments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the total loss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable decreased by $10.7 million, or 38.8%, to $16.9 million from $27.5 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease primarily related to losses recovered relating to retroceded private passenger automobile contracts that were not renewed during 2019. See Note 8 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the credit risk associated with our retrocessionaires.\nFor most of the contracts we write, our risk exposure is limited by defined limits of liability. Once each contract's limit of liability has been reached, we have no further exposure to additional losses from that contract. However, certain contracts, particularly quota share contracts that relate to first-dollar exposure, may not contain aggregate limits.\nOur property business, and to a lesser extent our casualty and other business, incorporate contracts that contain natural peril loss exposure. We estimate catastrophe loss exposure in terms of the PML. We anticipate that the PML will vary from period to period depending upon the modeled simulated losses and the composition of the in-force book of business. The projected severity levels are described in terms of a 1-in-250 year return period. The 1-in-250 year return period PML means that we believe there is a 0.4% chance in any given year that an occurrence of a natural catastrophe will lead to losses exceeding the stated estimate. In other words, it corresponds to a 99.6% probability that the loss from an event will fall below the indicated PML.\nPMLs are estimates and as a result, we cannot provide any assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event PML. The PML estimate incorporates all significant exposure from our reinsurance operations, including coverage for property, marine and energy, motor and catastrophe workers' compensation.\nAs of January 1, 2021, our estimated PML exposure (net of retrocession and reinstatement premiums) at a 1-in-250 year return period for a single event and in aggregate was $86.8 million and $109.6 million, respectively. The following table provides the PML for single event loss exposure and aggregate loss exposure to natural peril losses for each of the peak zones as of January 1, 2021:\n\nLink to Table of Contents\nTotal shareholders' equity\nTotal equity reported on the consolidated balance sheet decreased by $12.3 million to $464.9 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $477.2 million as of December 31, 2019. Retained earnings increased primarily due to a net income of $3.9 million reported for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company repurchased 2.5 million Class A ordinary shares during the year ended December 31, 2020 resulting in a $17.8 million decrease in shareholders' equity. For details of other movements in shareholders' equity see Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity.\u201d\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nGreenlight Capital Re is organized as a holding company with no operations of its own. As a holding company, Greenlight Capital Re has minimal continuing cash needs, most of which are related to the payment of administrative expenses and interest expense. All of our underwriting operations are conducted through our wholly-owned reinsurance subsidiaries, Greenlight Re and GRIL, which underwrite property and casualty reinsurance. There are restrictions on each of Greenlight Re's and GRIL's ability to pay dividends, which are described in more detail below. It is our current policy to retain earnings to support the growth of our business. We currently do not expect to pay dividends on our ordinary shares.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Greenlight Re and GRIL were each rated A- (Excellent)\u201d with a negative outlook, by A.M. Best. On July 22, 2020, A.M. Best affirmed the A- (Excellent)\u201d ratings. The ratings reflect A.M. Best's opinion of our reinsurance subsidiaries' financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations and it is not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our Class A ordinary shares. If A.M. Best downgrades our ratings below A- (Excellent)\u201d or withdraws our rating, we could be severely limited or prevented from writing any new reinsurance contracts, which would significantly and negatively affect our business. Our A.M. Best ratings may be revised or revoked at the sole discretion of the rating agency.\nSources and Uses of Funds\nOur sources of funds consist primarily of premium receipts (net of brokerage and ceding commissions), investment income and other income. We use cash from our operations to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses, profit commissions, interest and general and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2020, all of our investable assets, excluding strategic investments and funds required for business operations and for capital risk management, are invested by DME Advisors in SILP, subject to our investment guidelines. We have the ability to redeem funds from SILP at any time for operational purposes by providing three days' notice to the general partner. As of December 31, 2020, the majority of SILP's long investments were composed of cash and cash equivalents, and publicly-traded equity securities, which can be readily liquidated to meet our redemption requests. We record all investment income (loss), including any changes in the net asset value of SILP, and any unrealized gains and losses, in our consolidated statements of operations for each reporting period.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, the net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $(91.3) million and $1.6 million, respectively. The net cash provided by (used in) our underwriting activities and for payment of corporate expenses was $(94.9) million and $(9.6) million for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Generally, if the premiums collected exceed claim payments within a given period, we generate cash from our underwriting activities. Our underwriting activities represented a net use of cash for the year ended December 31, 2020, as the losses we paid exceeded the premiums we collected. The cash used in, and generated from underwriting activities may vary significantly from period to period depending on the underwriting opportunities available and claims submitted to us by our cedents.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our investing activities provided cash of $95.6 million. The source of cash was primarily net withdrawals from SILP which were used to pay losses, provide support for the Lloyds syndicated business, and fund collateral required by our ceding insurers. By comparison, for the same period in 2019, our investing activities provided cash of $63.3 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we believe we have sufficient cash flow from operating and investing activities to meet our foreseeable liquidity requirements. We expect that our operational needs for liquidity will not be materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and will be met by cash, funds generated from underwriting activities and investment income, including withdrawals from SILP, if necessary. As of December 31, 2020, we expect to fund our operations for the next twelve months from operating and investing cash flows. Additionally, during 2021, we expect the release of collateral held by certain cedents as the exposure relating to those contracts has decreased.\nLink to Table of Contents\nWe may explore various financing alternatives, including capital raising alternatives, to fund our business strategy, improve our capital structure, increase surplus, pay claims or make acquisitions. We can provide no assurances that any such transactions will occur or, if so, as to the terms of such transactions.\nAlthough GLRE is not subject to any significant legal prohibitions on the payment of dividends, Greenlight Re and GRIL are each subject to regulatory minimum capital requirements and regulatory constraints that affect their ability to pay dividends to GLRE. In addition, any dividend payment would have to be approved by the relevant regulatory authorities prior to payment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received regulatory approval for a return of $15.0 million of Greenlight Re's share premium to GLRE to facilitate the share repurchases. In October 2020, we received regulatory approval for return of up to $25.0 million of Greenlight Re's share premium to GLRE in order to provide additional capital to GRIL. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we used $17.8 million to repurchase 2.5 million Class A ordinary shares. As of December 31, 2020, Greenlight Re and GRIL both exceeded the regulatory minimum capital requirements.\nLetters of Credit and Trust Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, neither Greenlight Re nor GRIL was licensed or admitted as a reinsurer in any jurisdiction other than the Cayman Islands and the European Economic Area, respectively. Because many jurisdictions do not permit domestic insurance companies to take credit on their statutory financial statements for loss recoveries or ceded unearned premiums unless appropriate measures are in place for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non-admitted insurers, we anticipate that all of our U.S. clients and some of our non-U.S. clients will require us to provide collateral through funds withheld, trust arrangements, letters of credit or a combination thereof.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had one (2019: one) letter of credit facility available with an aggregate capacity of $275.0 million (2019: $400.0 million). See Note 15 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for details on the letter of credit facility. We provide collateral to cedents in the form of letters of credit and trust arrangements. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of collateral provided to cedents under such arrangements was $743.0 million (2019: $733.2 million). As of December 31, 2020, the letters of credit and trust accounts were secured by restricted cash and cash equivalents with a total fair value of $745.4 million (2019: $742.1 million).\nThe letter of credit facility contains customary events of default and restrictive covenants, including but not limited to, limitations on liens on collateral, transactions with affiliates, mergers and sales of assets, as well as solvency and maintenance of certain minimum pledged equity requirements, and restricts issuance of any debt without the consent of the letter of credit provider. Additionally, if an event of default exists, as defined in the letter of credit facility, Greenlight Re would be prohibited from paying dividends to its parent company. The Company was in compliance with all the covenants of this facility as of December 31, 2020.\nCapital\nOur capital structure currently consists of senior convertible notes and equity issued in two classes of ordinary shares. We expect that the existing capital base and internally generated funds will be sufficient to implement our business strategy for the foreseeable future. Consequently, we do not presently anticipate that we will incur any additional material indebtedness in the ordinary course of our business. However, in order to provide us with flexibility and timely access to public capital markets should we require additional capital for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes, we have filed a Form S-3 registration statement, which expires in July 2021. In addition, as noted above, we may explore various financing alternatives, although there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms when needed or desired. We did not make any significant commitments for capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn March 26, 2020, the Board of Directors extended the share repurchase plan to June 30, 2021 and increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased to 5.0 million Class A ordinary shares or securities convertible into Class A ordinary shares in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or Rule 10b5-1 stock trading plans. In addition, the Board of Directors also authorized the Company to repurchase up to $25.0 million aggregate face amount of the Company's 4.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the Notes\u201d) in privately negotiated transactions, in open market repurchases or pursuant to one more tender offers. The Company is not required to repurchase any of the Class A ordinary shares or the Notes and the repurchase plans may be modified, suspended or terminated at the election of our Board of Directors at any time without prior notice. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 2.5 million Class A ordinary shares were repurchased by the Company. As of December 31, 2020, 2.5 million Class A ordinary shares and $25.0 million of the Notes, remained available for repurchase under the repurchase plans.\nLink to Table of Contents\nOn October 29, 2020, our shareholders approved an amendment to our stock incentive plan to increase the number of Class A ordinary shares available for issuance by 3.0 million shares from 5.0 million to 8.0 million shares. As of December 31, 2020, there were 3,474,888 Class A ordinary shares available for future issuance under the Company's stock incentive plan. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the stock incentive plan.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nDue to the nature of our reinsurance operations, the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our reinsurance contractual liabilities will fluctuate, perhaps materially, and, therefore, are highly uncertain. As of December 31, 2020, the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are expected to payout as follows:\n\n(1)Reflects our minimum contractual obligations pursuant to the lease agreements as described below.\n(2)Includes interest payments due on $100.0 million of senior convertible note payable at 4.0% per annum, as well as the payment of principal upon maturity on August 1, 2023.\n(3) Due to the nature of our reinsurance operations, the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our reinsurance contractual liabilities will fluctuate, perhaps materially, and, therefore, are highly uncertain.\nGreenlight Re had entered into lease agreements for office space in the Cayman Islands.

The IAA has an initial term ending on August 31, 2023 subject to automatic extension for successive three-year terms. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, management fees paid by SILP to DME Advisors were $2.8 million and $4.9 million, respectively. Pursuant to the SILP LPA, DME II is entitled to a performance allocation equal to 20% of the net profit, calculated per annum, of each limited partner's share of the capital account managed by DME Advisors, subject to a loss carry forward provision. DME II is not entitled to earn a performance allocation in a year in which SILP incurs a loss. The loss carry forward provision contained in the SILP LPA allows DME II to earn reduced performance allocation of 10% of net profits in years subsequent to the year in which the capital accounts of the limited partners incur a loss, until all losses are recouped and an additional amount equal to 150% of the loss is earned. For the year ended December 31, 2020, a performance allocation of $0.4 million (2019: $5.0 million) was netted against income in the caption Investment in related party investment fund\u201d in the Company's consolidated statement of operations.\nThe Company has entered into a service agreement with DME Advisors pursuant to which DME Advisors will provide investor relations services to us for compensation of $5,000 per month plus expenses. The service agreement had an initial term of one year, and continues for sequential one-year periods until terminated by us or DME Advisors. Either party may terminate the service agreement for any reason with 30 days prior written notice to the other party.\nOur related party transactions are presented in Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nLink to Table of Contents\nOff-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements\nWe have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. Other than our investments in SILP and AccuRisk Holdings LLC (see Notes 3 and 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements), we have not participated in transactions that created relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including VIEs, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.\nEffects of Inflation\nInflation generally affects the cost of claims and claim expenses, as well as asset values in our investment portfolio. The onset, duration and severity of an inflationary period cannot be predicted or estimated with precision.The anticipated effects of inflation on our claim costs are considered in our pricing and reserving models. However, the actual effect of increases in claim costs due to inflation cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled, and may differ significantly from our estimate.",
