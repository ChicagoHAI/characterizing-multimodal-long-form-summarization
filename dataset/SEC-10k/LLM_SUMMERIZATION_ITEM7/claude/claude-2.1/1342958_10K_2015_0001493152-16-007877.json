We have the ability to integrate electronic, radio, computer, mechanical, and multi-media technologies to create unique solutions to our customers' requests. We began shipping our flagship digital video mirror product in March 2006. We have developed additional products to complement our DVM-500 and DVM-750, our original in-car digital video products, including lower priced in-car digital video mirrors (the DVM-100, DVM-400, DVM-800 and MicroVU HD), and body worn camera (FirstVU HD) products designed for law enforcement usage. Since 2011 we have launched the following new products: the FirstVU HD; DVM-800; the MicroVU HD; the patented VuLink product which integrates our body-worn cameras with our in-car systems by providing hands-free automatic activation; and the new line of digital video mirrors (the DVM-250 and DVM-250 Plus) that serve as event recorders\u201d for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets in order to expand our customer base beyond the traditional law enforcement agencies. We have additional research and development projects that we anticipate will result in several new product launches in 2016. We believe that the launch of these new products will help to diversify and broaden the market for our product offerings.\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe experienced operating losses for all of the quarters during 2015 and 2014.

These variations result from the timing of large individual orders and the traction gained by our new products, such as the FirstVU HD, MicroVU HD, FleetVU and DVM-800. We reported an operating loss of $2,700,529 on revenues of $5,051,119 for fourth quarter 2015 compared to an operating loss of $2,140,785 on revenues of $5,096,088 for third quarter 2015, an operating loss of $816,962 on revenues of $5,634,237 for second quarter 2015, and an operating loss of $1,963,195 on revenues of $4,248,764 for first quarter 2015. Our fourth quarter 2015 revenues decreased slightly from third quarter 2015. Our gross margin percentage decreased to 31.0% in the fourth quarter from 40.0% in the third quarter 2015 and 54.9% in the second quarter 2015. During the third quarter 2015, we decided to upgrade the connectors contained in the camera cable assembly on our FirstVU HD product to improve functionality and reliability. This upgrade was applied to all deployed units in the field as well as in our inventory, which required us to rework the camera assemblies and scrap a portion of the original cable assembly. Total scrap costs recognized in third and fourth quarter 2015 approximated $1,615,000, which adversely affected our gross margins and other operating results. Management believes the FirstVU HD connector upgrade implemented to all deployed units during the third and fourth quarter 2015 will resolve the cable assembly issue and that gross margins should return to more normal levels in future quarters. Our selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses were higher in the fourth quarter 2015 compared to the first three quarters of 2015. The primary reason for the increased SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter 2015 over the three prior quarters of 2015 was the addition of technical support staff to handle field inquiries and installation matters because our installed customer base has expanded and additional technical support staff required for our new products, such as the FirstVU HD and DVM-800. Many of our customers require extensive information technology infrastructure planning to manage and store the audio/video evidence gathered by our systems, which often requires new and larger data servers. Our international revenues during 2015 decreased to $148,667 from $961,763 in 2014.\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere have been a number of factors and trends affecting our recent performance, which include:\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Revenues decreased in fourth quarter 2015 to $5,051,119 from $5,096,088 in third quarter 2015 and $5,634,237 in second quarter 2015. We believe the decline in revenues in the fourth quarter 2015 and third quarter 2015 was attributable to a competitor, TASER International, Inc. ( Taser\u201d) stating in one of its press releases that all the claims in one of our patents were determined to be unpatentable.\u201d We believe its press release was misleading and incorrect, causing confusion and concern in our marketplace, customer base and potential customers. Taser commenced an action in the United States Patent & Trademark Office ( USPTO\u201d) for a reexamination of our U.S. Patent No. 8,781,292 (the '292 Patent\u201d). A reexamination is essentially a request that the USPTO review whether the patent should have issued in its present form in view of the prior art,\u201d e.g., other patents in the same technology field. The '292 Patent relates to the \u2018automatic trigger\u201d that allows our body camera and our in-car system to automatically begin recording without the need for law enforcement officers to manually turn them on. The automatic trigger covered by our '292 Patent is incorporated in our VuLink product. Such product has been popular and consequently the confusion and misinformation caused by our competitor has impacted our revenues of our VuLink product and body-worn and in-car systems. Ultimately, the USPTO rejected Taser's efforts and reconfirmed the validity of the '292 patent on January 16, 2016 and we have filed suit alleging willful patent infringement against Taser and included claims of commercial bribery and other unfair trade practices. See Litigation for details. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Recognizing a critical limitation in law enforcement camera technology, during 2014 we pioneered the development of our VuLink ecosystem that provided intuitive auto-activation functionality as well as coordination between multiple recording devices. The USPTO has recognized these pioneering efforts by granting us multiple patents with claims covering numerous features, such as automatically activating an officer's cameras when the light bar is activated or a data-recording device such as a smart weapon is activated. Additionally, Digital Ally's patent claims cover automatic coordination between multiple recording devices. Prior to this work, officers were forced to manually activate each device while responding to emergency scenarios - a requirement that both decreased the usefulness of the existing camera systems and diverted officers' attention during critical moments. We are seeing a trend in which law enforcement agencies have recognized the value of our VuLink technology and are seeking information on auto-activation\u201d features in requests for bids and requests for information involving the procurement process of body-worn cameras and in-car systems. We believe this trend may result in our patented VuLink technology becoming the de-facto standard\u201d for agencies engaged in deploying state-of-the-art body-worn and in-car camera systems. We expect that this technology will have a significant impact on our revenues in the long-term particularly if we are successful in our prosecution of the patent infringement litigation currently pending with Taser. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>We believe recently highly publicized law enforcement incidents have provided federal, state and municipal governments with an opportunity to reassess spending priorities, moving from the militarization of the police to increasing transparency and accountability. This underlying shift in priorities has redirected and increased law enforcement budgets and funding to our products and offerings. We are hopeful this trend continues into 2016 and beyond. In that regard, our FirstVU body-worn camera revenues increased to 20% of total 2015 revenues from 11% of revenues in 2014. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>We have launched additional products to complement our legacy in-car video products for law enforcement agencies in an effort to diversify our sources of revenue to new market channels. In that regard, we have expanded our product offerings to include incident recorders designed to meet commercial fleet owners' needs. We believe these commercial fleet offerings will be appealing to prospective customers who want to monitor, manage and train their drivers and to provide liability protection. Such fleet customers may include ambulance service providers, taxicab fleets, limousine services, off-premises airport parking services, over the road trucks and others who maintain a fleet of vehicles. We expect that our commercial fleet business will be a significant growth provider for us in the future.

Our gross margin decline is primarily attributable to the camera cable connector upgrade implemented in the third and fourth quarter 2015 to our FirstVU HD product that caused us to rework our entire installed base of FirstVU HD's and scrap a portion of the original cable assembly. This upgrade contributed to total scrap costs approximating $1,615,000 that adversely affected our fourth and third quarter 2015 gross margins. Management believes the FirstVU HD connector upgrade implemented to all deployed units during the third quarter and fourth quarter 2015 will resolve the cable assembly issue and that gross margins should return to more normal levels in future quarters. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Our international revenues were less than expected for the year ends December 31, 2015 and 2014, with total international revenues of $148,667 (1% of total revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $961,763 (6% of total revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014. Unfavorable changes in the foreign exchange rate in many countries have impacted our international sales. We were disappointed in our international revenues given the high level of bidding activity. We provided bids to a number of international customers; however, international sale cycles generally take longer than domestic business. We are hopeful that our new products will appeal to international customers, in particular the DVM-800 and FirstVU HD, although we can make no assurances in this regard. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable

Our newer products, the DVM-800 and the FirstVU HD, contributed 56% of total sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, compared to 51% for the comparable period ending December 31, 2014. We expect the sales mix will continue to transition from our legacy M-500 Plus and DVM -750 product lines to the newer products during 2016. In addition, our commercial event recorders increased from 5% to 10% of total revenues. We expect this trend to continue because of the appeal of our new FleetVU driver management and monitoring tool.\nRevenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $20,030,208 and $17,444,419, respectively, an increase of $2,585,789 (15%), due to the following factors:\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Our revenues increased significantly for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 (15%). We believe the improvement is attributable to the increased attention to the benefits of video evidence caused by the civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri and other cities in the United States and the features of our newer products. We have had a large increase in inquiries, test and evaluation units for our FirstVU and DVM-800 products in our pilot programs for prospective clients since the events in Ferguson, Missouri and elsewhere and are hopeful these will culminate in sales as the potential customers evaluate our body-worn and in-car video camera solutions. We believe that there has been a shift in buying patterns of our customers to emphasize our products because of the transparency and accountability they provide to the general public. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>We shipped twenty-two individual orders in excess of $100,000, for a total of approximately $3,727,000 in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to six individual orders in excess of $100,000, for a total of approximately $2,500,000 in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. Eight of the large orders were for a package including our in-car video system, our FirstVU body worn camera and our patented VULink connectivity system. Additionally, six of the large orders were for our commercial event recorders and most of those orders included our FleetVu driver management and monitoring tool.

Our international revenues during 2015 were negatively impacted by the unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates for our international customers. In particular the Mexican peso exchange rate deterioration has delayed purchases by several of our largest customers and opportunities. We were disappointed in our international revenues given the high level of bidding activity. We have provided bids to a number of international customers; however, international sale cycles generally take longer than domestic business. We also believe that our new products may appeal to international customers, in particular the DVM-800 and FirstVU HD, although we can make no assurances in this regard. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue on units sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $11,680,853 and $7,521,626, respectively, an increase of $4,159,227 (55%). The increase in cost of goods sold is partially due to the 15% increase in revenues. In addition, we encountered printed circuit board issues in our FirstVU HD body-worn cameras early in 2015 and in response upgraded the entire installed base of FirstVUs in the third and fourth quarter 2015. The upgrade involved the replacement of a connector contained in the camera cable assembly on our FirstVU HD product that dramatically increased rework and scrap rates on our FirstVU HD. Our scrap costs were approximately $1,615,000 for third and fourth quarter 2015. We also increased our inventory reserve in 2015 due to changes in the sales mix to the DVM-800 platform, which has resulted in a higher level of excess component parts of older versions of our legacy products. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased to 58% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 43% for the year ended December 31, 2014. We believe that the FirstVU HD connector upgrade implemented to all deployed units during the third and fourth quarter 2015 will resolve the cable assembly issue and that gross margins should return to more normal levels in 2016. Our goal is to maintain cost of sales as a percentage of revenues at 40% or less during 2016. We expect that our newer product offerings, in particular the DVM-800, VuLink and FirstVU HD, should improve our cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales in the longer term. We do not expect to incur significant capital expenditures to ramp up production of our current products because our internal process is largely assembling subcomponents, testing and shipping of completed products or we use contract manufacturers. We rely on our subcontractors to produce finished circuit boards that represent the primary components of our products, thereby reducing our need to purchase capital equipment.\nWe had $1,202,411 and $600,578 in reserves for obsolete and excess inventories at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Total raw materials and component parts were $3,833,873 and $2,987,124 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, an increase of $846,749 (28%). The increase in raw materials and component parts is primarily attributable to our forecasts of sales for the FirstVU HD, and VuLink and the need to secure long lead component inventory items in advance of production. Finished goods balances were $7,895,663 and $6,576,480 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, an increase of $1,319,183 (20%). The increase in finished goods was primarily for the DVM-750 product for anticipated international customer orders and additional cameras for our various products. Finished goods at December 31, 2015 consist primarily of the Laser Ally products and our DVM-500 Plus and DVM-750 products for expected orders. The increase in the inventory reserve is primarily due to the change in sales mix of our products which has resulted in a higher level of excess component parts of the older versions of our legacy products. We believe the reserves are appropriate given our inventory levels at December 31, 2015.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $8,349,355 and $9,922,793, respectively, a decrease of $1,573,438 (16%). The decrease is a result of the cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increasing to 58% during the year ended December 31, 2015 from 43% for the year ended December 31, 2014 offset by the 15% increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our goal is to improve our margins to 60% over the longer term based on the expected margins of our newer products, in particular the DVM-800 and FirstVU HD, as they continue to gain traction in the marketplace and we increase commercial production in 2016. In addition, as revenues increase from these products, we will seek to further improve our margins from them through economies of scale and more efficiently utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components. We plan to continue our initiative on more efficient management of our supply chain through outsourcing production, quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $15,970,826 and $12,811,987 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $3,158,839 (25%).

We employed a total of 25 engineers at December 31, 2015 compared to 22 engineers at December 31, 2014, most of whom are dedicated to research and development activities for new products. We are increasing our engineering staff of web-based developers as we expand our offerings to include cloud-based evidence storage and management for our law enforcement customers (VuVault.net) and our web-based commercial fleet driver monitoring and management tool (FleetVU). Research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 15% in 2015 compared to 17% in 2014. We have active research and development projects on several new products, as well as upgrades to our existing product lines. We consider our research and development capabilities and new product focus to be a competitive advantage and will continue to invest in this area on a prudent basis.\nSelling, advertising and promotional expenses. Selling, advertising and promotional expense totaled $3,965,400 and $3,340,764 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $624,636 (19%). Salaries and commissions to our sales personnel represent the primary components of these costs and were $3,116,729 and $2,729,589 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $387,140 (14%), which is commensurate with our 15% increase in revenues. The effective commission rate was 15.6% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nPromotional and advertising expenses totaled $848,671 during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $611,175 during the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $237,496 (39%). The increase is primarily attributable to the Company becoming the title sponsor of the Web.com Tour golf tournament held annually in the Kansas City Metropolitan area. Our net promotional expense related to sponsorship of the 2015 tournament totaled $172,623. Additionally, we had increased participation in trade shows and media advertising in trade publications and other marketing initiatives designed to help penetrate commercial markets for our DVM-250 Plus event recorders, and to increase awareness of our FirstVU HD, MicroVu HD, VuLink and the DVM-800 within our law enforcement channel during 2015.\nStock-based compensation expense. Stock based compensation expense totaled $1,623,033 and $834,593 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $788,440 (94%). The increase is primarily due to the amortization of the restricted stock granted during 2015 to our officers, directors, and other employees that had the effect of increasing the stock compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. The total number of restricted shares granted and our market stock price was higher on the specific dates of the 2015 stock grants compared to previous years, which increased the grant date fair value attributable to the restricted stock grants.\nThe total number of restricted shares granted to the Board of Directors, officers and employees increased to 326,500 shares during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 192,500 shares during the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, the weighted average grant date price of the shares increased to $8.42 per share compared to $5.33 per share during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nProfessional fees and expense. Professional fees and expenses totaled $1,368,758 and $1,153,985 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $214,773 (19%). Professional fees during 2014 and 2015 were related primarily to normal public company matters, intellectual property matters and litigation matters. The increase in professional fees and expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to higher accounting fees and litigation expenses related to the Utility and Taser matters.

This increase is primarily attributable to the hiring of additional technical support staff to handle field inquiries and installation matters because our installed customer base has expanded and the need for additional technical support staff for our new products, such as the DVM-800, FirstVU HD, VuVault.com and FleetVU. In addition, the Company established a bonus plan during 2015, which resulted in approximately $260,000 in compensation expense and the Company incurred an increase of approximately $250,000 in employee-based retention expenses.\nOther. Other selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $3,091,677 and $2,564,686 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $526,991 (21%). The increase in other expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to increased consulting, contract labor and insurance expenses. We are utilizing consultants to help develop engineering and manufacturing standard processes with a goal of achieving ISO 13485, ISO 9001, FDA cGMPs, and MD Directive 93/42/EEC certifications. We also utilized consultants to help design, develop and launch a new corporate website in 2015.\nOperating Loss\nFor the reasons previously stated, our operating loss was $7,621,471 and $2,889,194 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a deterioration of $4,732,277 (164%). Operating loss as a percentage of revenues increased to 38% in 2015 from 17% in 2014.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased to $21,156 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $13,660 in 2014. The increase is attributable to an increase in average cash and cash equivalents balances related to our $12.0 million registered direct offering which was completed in July 2015.\nChange in Warrant Derivative Liabilities\nDetachable warrants to purchase a total of 398,916 common shares, as adjusted, were issued in conjunction with the Secured Convertible Notes ( Secured Convertible Notes\u201d) during March and August 2014. The warrants were required to be treated as derivative liabilities because of their anti-dilution and down-round provisions. Accordingly, we estimated the fair value of such warrants as of their respective date of issuance and record a corresponding derivative liability in the balance sheet. Upon exercise of the warrants we recognized a gain/loss based on the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise. In addition, the warrant derivative liability is adjusted to the estimated fair value of any unexercised warrants as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nThe holder of the Secured Convertible Notes exercised a portion of such warrants in August 2014 and in September 2014 with the change in value of the warrant derivative totaling $3,233,068 being recognized as a non-cash charge to operations during the year ended December 31, 2014 representing the increase in our stock price over the exercise price at the respective exercise dates. The changes in the fair value of the warrant derivatives related to unexercised warrants totaled $1,193,694 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in warrant derivative liabilities totaled $4,426,762 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the warrant derivative liability balance was $2,186,214 as of December 31, 2014.\nThe holder of the Secured Convertible Notes exercised a portion of its warrants in March 2015 and April 2015 with the change in value of the warrant derivative through the date of exercise resulting in a gain of $336,373 compared to the estimated warrant derivative liability balance. The resulting derivative balance of $1,748,155 was offset against the warrant derivative liability during the year ended December 31, 2015. The changes in the fair value of the warrant derivatives related to unexercised warrants resulted in a gain of $34,633 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The change in warrant derivative liabilities resulted in a gain of $371,006 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the warrant derivative liability balance was $67,053 as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nChange in Fair Value of Secured Convertible Notes Payable\nWe elected to account for and record the Secured Convertible Notes on their fair value basis. The holder of the Secured Convertible Notes exercised its right to convert such notes to 316,716 common shares during July 2014 through September 2014. The change in fair market value of the Secured Convertible Notes associated with the conversion of debt was $384,614 during the year ended December 31, 2014, representing the increase in our stock price over the conversion price as of the respective conversion dates. On December 4, 2014, the holder of the Secured Convertible Note exercised its right to convert $36,600 principal amount into 6,000 shares of our common stock at the conversion price of $6.10 per share. The increase in fair market value of these 6,000 shares over the $36,600 principal retired was $89,400, representing the increase in our stock price over the conversion price as of the conversion date. As of December 31, 2014 the fair market value of the remaining Secured Convertible Note was $3,273,431 representing a change in fair market value for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaling $302,552. Accordingly, the total change in fair value of the two Secured Convertible Notes payable was $776,566 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe holder of the Secured Convertible Notes exercised its right to convert the remaining principal balance of such Notes into 655,738 shares of common stock and 5,475 shares for accrued interest thereon at a conversion price of $7.32 per share in separate transactions between February 13 and 25, 2015. The increase in fair market value of the 655,213 shares over the $3,963,780 principal retired was $4,434,383, representing the increase in our stock price over the conversion price as of the conversion dates. Accordingly, the total change in fair value of the Secured Convertible Notes payable was a $4,434,383 loss for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nSecured Convertible Notes Issuance Expenses\nWe elected to account for and record our Secured Convertible Notes on a fair value basis. Accordingly, we were required to expense the related issuance costs to other expense which totaled $93,845 and $579,066 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 2015 expenses were attributable to the proxy costs incurred for our Special Meeting of Shareholders held on February 13, 2015 to approve the issuance of shares above the Nasdaq Share Cap in connection with the issuance of the Secured Convertible Note in August 2014. The December 31, 2014 expenses included a $360,000 placement agent fee and the remainder was primarily legal fees.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income increased to $1,878 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from ($5,589) in 2014.\nInterest Expense\nWe incurred interest expense of $282,233 and $499,744 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $217,511 (44%). We issued an aggregate of $2.5 million principal amount of subordinated notes during 2011, which bore interest at the rate of 8% per annum until the notes were paid in full on July 24, 2015. On March 24, 2014, we issued the $2.0 million Secured Convertible Note that remained outstanding until its full conversion in three separate tranches between July 1, 2014 and September 19, 2014. On August 28, 2014, we issued the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note bearing interest at the rate of 6% per annum that remained outstanding until its full conversion in eight separate tranches between February 13, 2015 and February 25, 2015.\nWe amortized to interest expense $55,187 and $132,447, representing the discount associated with the $2.5 million subordinated note during years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The total remaining unamortized discount was $0 and $55,187 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nLoss before Income Tax Benefit\nAs a result of the above, we reported a loss before income tax benefit of $12,037,892 and $9,163,261 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a deterioration of $2,874,631 (31%).\nIncome Tax Benefit\nWe did not record an income tax benefit related to our losses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, due to our overall net operating loss carryforwards available. We have further determined to continue providing a full valuation reserve on our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015. During 2015, we increased our valuation reserve on deferred tax assets by $5,413,000 whereby our deferred tax assets continue to be fully reserved due to our recent operating losses.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe had approximately $30,700,000 of net operating loss carryforwards and $1,747,000 of research and development tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2015 available to offset future net taxable income.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the above, we reported net losses of $12,037,892 and $9,163,261 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a deterioration of $2,874,631 (31%).\nBasic and Diluted Loss per Share\nThe basic and diluted loss per share was $2.77 and $3.54 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for the reasons previously noted. All outstanding stock options were considered antidilutive and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 because of the net loss reported for each period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverall:\nDuring 2011, we borrowed a total of $2.5 million under an unsecured credit facility with a private, third-party lender. The $2.5 million of subordinated notes bore interest at the rate of 8% per annum and are payable interest only on a monthly basis. The subordinated notes were subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness; as such term is defined in the Notes. On December 4, 2013, we entered into an agreement with the lender that extended the maturity dates of the subordinated notes from May 30, 2014 to May 30, 2015, which was later extended to August 15, 2015. The subordinated notes were unsecured and did not prevent us from obtaining new senior secured financings. On July 24, 2015, we paid the entire $2.5 million of outstanding principal together with all accrued interest in full.\nOn March 24, 2014, we completed a private placement of the $2.0 million Secured Convertible Note, which bore interest at 6% per annum, payable quarterly, and was secured by all of our assets. In addition, we issued the holder detachable warrants to acquire 130,000 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share (the March 2014 Warrant\u201d). On July 10, 2014 we and the holder of the $2.0 million Secured Convertible Note entered into an agreement under which we reduced the conversion price of the Senior Secured Note to $6.25 per share during the period from July 11 to July 14, 2014. During the foregoing period the holder converted $1,777,778 principal amount and $2,963 accrued interest on the Secured Convertible Note into 284,928 shares of our common stock. On July 15, 2014 the conversion price returned to $8.55 per share. The holder of the $2.0 million Secured Convertible Note exercised its right to convert the remaining outstanding principal into 26,263 shares of common stock in two separate tranches on August 28, 2014 and September 19, 2014. In addition, the holder exercised its warrant to purchase 130,000 shares of common stock resulting in cash proceeds of $951,600 during 2014 and utilized the cashless exercise feature for the remaining 6,621 shares.\nOn August 28, 2014, we completed a second private placement to the holder of the $2.0 million Secured Convertible Note and issued the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note, which bore interest at 6% per annum, payable quarterly, and was secured by all assets of the Company. Principal payments were not required until the sixth month after origination and continued ratably for the remaining 18-month term. The principal and interest payments could be made through the payment of cash or in-kind by transferring unrestricted and fully registered shares in an amount equivalent to 80% of the volume weighted average trading price for the 20 consecutive trading days preceding the payment date. The $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note was convertible into shares of common stock at the holder's option at a conversion price of $6.10 per share at any time it was outstanding. In addition, we could force conversion if the market price exceeded $12.20 per share for 20 consecutive trading days. In connection with the second private placement we issued a warrant exercisable to purchase 262,295 shares of common stock at $7.32 per share (the August Warrant\u201d), which was exercisable immediately and expires August 28, 2019.\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn December 4, 2014, the holder of the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note converted $36,600 of principal into 6,000 shares of common stock and in February 2015 the holder exercised its conversion rights on the remaining principal and accrued interest balances in exchange for an additional 655,213 shares of common stock. The $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note and August Warrant contained anti-dilution provisions and restricted the incurrence of additional secured indebtedness. We paid a placement agent fee of $240,000 and approximately $101,500 of other third party costs in connection with the transaction, which included legal fees. We used the funds generated by this credit facility to provide the working capital for our operations in 2015.\nIn connection with the anti-dilution provisions of the March 2014 Warrant, the Company was required to increase the number of shares to be issued upon the exercise of the March 2014 Warrant to 136,621 from 100,000 and to reduce the exercise price to $7.32 from $10.00 per share in connection with the August 2014 private placement.\nIn accordance with the terms of the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note we were required to maintain minimum cash balance of not less than $1.5 million until such time as we satisfied all of the Equity Conditions,\u201d as defined in the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note. Such Equity Conditions included our shareholders approving the issuance of shares above the Nasdaq Share Cap. The $1.5 million minimum cash balance was reported as restricted cash separate from cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014. On February 13, 2015, the shareholders approved the issuance of shares above the Nasdaq Share Cap, thereby releasing the restriction on the cash balances.\nBetween February 13 and 25, 2015 the holder of the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note exercised its right to convert the remaining principal on the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note into 655,738 shares of common stock and 5,475 shares for accrued interest at the conversion price of $7.32 per share. In addition, the holder also exercised part of its August Warrant to purchase 212,295 shares of common stock resulting in cash proceeds of $1,553,999 during first quarter 2015. The holder exercised part of its August Warrant to purchase 37,800 shares resulting in cash proceeds of $276,690 during second quarter 2015. Warrants to purchase a total of 12,200 common shares for $7.32 remain outstanding as of December 31, 2015.\nOn July 22, 2015, we closed a $12.0 million offering of our common stock and common stock purchase warrants in an at-the-market registered direct offering and a concurrent private placement of two series of common stock purchase warrants with two investors. At the closing we sold an aggregate of 879,766 shares of our common stock at a per share price of $13.64 in a registered direct offering to the investors. We also issued a registered short-term warrant to the investors exercisable to purchase a total of 437,086 shares of common stock in such offering. Additionally, in a concurrent private placement, we issued to the investors short-term warrants exercisable to purchase a total of 222,738 shares of common stock and long-term warrants exercisable to purchase a total of 879,766 shares of common stock. Both the short-term registered and private placement warrants are immediately exercisable, have an exercise price of $13.43 per share and expire 24 months from the date of issuance. The long-term warrants are immediately exercisable, have an exercise price of $13.43 per share and expire five and one-half years from the date of issuance. After placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses, the net offering proceeds to us totaled approximately $11.2 million prior to any exercise of the warrants. The warrants issued in this transaction did not contain terms that would require us to record derivative warrant liabilities that could affect our financial statements. Proceeds of the offering were used to repay the $2.5 million principal amount of subordinated notes plus accrued interest in full and for working capital purposes.\nAfter completion of the $12.0 million offering on July 22, 2015 and the payment of the $2.5 million principal amount of subordinated notes, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to support our operations for 2016. In addition, if the need arises, we may seek commercial credit facilities including traditional bank borrowings to improve our liquidity position and to finance growth opportunities or future capital needs that may arise.\nWe have warrants outstanding to purchase 1,599,290 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price $13.25 per share outstanding as of December 31, 2015. In addition, there are common stock purchase options outstanding covering 328,690 shares at an average price of $20.43 per share. The exercise of these common stock equivalents would provide us with an additional potential source of liquidity.\nWe had $6,924,079 of available cash and equivalents and net working capital of approximately $18.7 million as of December 31, 2015. Net working capital as of December 31, 2015 includes approximately $3.4 million of accounts receivable and $10.7 million of inventory.\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and cash equivalents balances: As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents with an aggregate balance of $6,924,079, an increase from a balance of $3,049,716 at December 31, 2014.

The deterioration was primarily the result of our net loss, increases in inventory and decreases in accounts payable offset by increases in deferred revenue and non-cash charges for stock based compensation and fair value changes on debt. Our goal is to increase revenues, return to profitability and decrease our inventory levels during 2016, thereby providing positive cash flows from operations, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in this regard. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Investing activities: </td> <td>$881,047 of net cash provided by investing activities.

We satisfied the Equity Conditions\u201d on February 13, 2015, the restriction on the $1.5 million was lifted and the funds became available for working capital needs. In 2015, we replaced and upgraded our internal servers and infrastructure including upgrades to our enterprise software.

The term of the agreement was 42 months after the date Dragoneye began full scale production of the product, which commenced in August 2010 and final certification of the product was obtained. The agreement had minimum purchase requirements of 1,000 units per period over three commitment periods. On January 31, 2012, the agreement was amended to reduce the minimum purchase commitment over the second and third years by 52% of the original commitment. We agreed to release our world-wide right to exclusively market the product to the law enforcement community in exchange for the reduction in the purchase commitment.\nThe agreement originally required minimum order quantities that represent a remaining unfulfilled commitment to acquire $634,680 of product as of December 31, 2014. Dragoneye is responsible for all warranty, damage or other claims, losses or liabilities related to the product and is obligated to defend and indemnify us against such risks. We held approximately $1,318,000 of such products in finished goods inventory as of December 31, 2015 and had sold approximately 1,010 units since the beginning of the agreement through December 31, 2015.\nWe filed a lawsuit on June 15, 2013 against Dragoneye for breaching the contract and participated in a mediation of the lawsuit on August 12, 2015 that resulted in a settlement on August 25, 2015. The settlement includes the repair of all LaserAlly units we currently hold and future customer returned units exhibiting the same failure. See Litigation\u201d below for further details.\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLitigation.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings arising from normal business operations. Although there can be no assurances, based on the information currently available, we believe that it is probable that the ultimate outcome of each of the actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. However, an adverse outcome in certain of the actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the period in which it is recorded.\nOn June 5, 2013, we filed a lawsuit in the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas against Dragoneye. We had entered into a supply and distribution agreement with Dragoneye on May 1, 2010 under which we were granted the right to sell and distribute a proprietary law enforcement speed measurement device and derivatives to our customers under the trade name LaserAlly. The parties amended the agreement on January 31, 2012. In our complaint we alleged that Dragoneye breached the contract because it failed to maintain as confidential information our customer list; it infringed on our trademarks, including LaserAlly and Digital Ally; it tortiously interfered with our existing contracts and business relationships with our dealers, distributors, customers and trading partners; and it engaged in unfair competition and violated the Kansas Uniform Trade Secrets Statutes. We amended the complaint to include claims regarding alleged material defects in the products supplied under the agreement. We participated in a mediation of the lawsuit on August 12, 2015 and agreed to an omnibus resolution of the matter. The settlement included the return of and repair free of charge of all LaserAlly units we held and future customer returned units exhibiting the same or similar failure. Dragoneye was allowed no more than 120 days from October 1, 2015 to repair all units, upgrade all units to current firmware release and to re-certify the units. We will remit the unpaid balance of approximately $191,000 ($91,684.47 remaining at December 31, 2015) currently recorded in accounts payable to Dragoneye in five payments concurrent with the repair and return of units by Dragoneye. Furthermore, all of the remaining minimum contractual purchase requirements were voided. On August 25, 2015, the judge approved the parties' joint stipulation of dismissal with prejudice, which finalized the settlement.\nOn October 25, 2013, we filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas to eliminate threats by a competitor, Utility Associates, Inc. ( Utility\u201d), of alleged patent infringement regarding U.S. Patent No. 6,831,556 (the '556 patent\u201d). Specifically, the lawsuit seeks a declaration that our mobile video surveillance systems do not infringe any claim of the '556 patent. We became aware that Utility had mailed letters to current and prospective purchasers of our mobile video surveillance systems threatening that the use of such systems purchased from third parties not licensed to the '556 patent would create liability for them for patent infringement. We reject Utility's assertion and will vigorously defend the right of end-users to purchase such systems from providers other than Utility. The United States District Court for the District of Kansas dismissed the lawsuit because it decided that Kansas was not the proper jurisdictional forum for the dispute. The District Court's decision was not a ruling on the merits of the case. We appealed the decision and the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court's previous decision.\nIn addition, we began proceedings to invalidate the '556 patent through a request for inter partes review of the '556 patent at the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO\u201d). On July 27, 2015, the USPTO invalidated key claims in Utility's '556 Patent. The Final Decision from the USPTO significantly curtails Utility's ability to threaten law enforcement agencies, municipalities, and others with infringement of the '556 Patent. Utility has appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Briefs have not yet been filed and no schedule for oral argument has been issued. We believe Utility will have a difficult time convincing the appellate court to overturn the decision of the USPTO.\nOn June 4, 2014 we filed an Unfair Competition lawsuit against Utility Associates, Inc. ( Utility\u201d) in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. In the lawsuit we contend that Utility has defamed us and illegally interfered with our contracts, customer relationships and business expectancies by falsely asserting to our customers and others that our products violate the '556 Patent, of which Utility claims to be the holder.\nOur suit also includes claims against Utility for tortious interference with contract and violation of the Kansas Uniform Trade Secrets Act, arising out of Utility's employment of one of our employees, in violation of that employee's Non-Competition and Confidentiality agreements with us. In addition to damages, we are seeking temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief, prohibiting Utility from, among other things, continuing to threaten or otherwise interfere with our customers. On March 4, 2015, an initial hearing was held upon our request for injunctive relief.\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased upon facts revealed at the March 4, 2015 hearing, on March 16, 2015, we sought leave to amend our Complaint in the Kansas suit to assert additional claims against Utility. Those new claims include claims of actual or attempted monopolization, in violation of \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act, claims arising under a new Georgia statute that prohibits threats of patent infringement in bad faith,\u201d and additional claims of unfair competition/false advertising in violation of \u00a7 63(a) of the Lanham Act. As these statutes expressly provide, we are seeking treble damages, punitive damages and attorneys' fees, as well as injunctive relief. The Court concluded its hearing on April 22, 2015, and allowed us leave to amend our complaint, but denied our preliminary injunction. The case is now in the discovery stage. However, we believe that the USPTO's final decision issued on July 27, 2015 will provide us with substantial basis to pursue our claims either through court trial or by summary judgment motions. We intend to pursue recovery from Utility, its insurers and other parties, as appropriate.\nOn June 13, 2014, Utility filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against us alleging infringement of the '556 patent. The suit was served on us on June 20, 2014. As alleged in our first filed lawsuit described above, we believe the '556 patent is both invalid and not infringed. Further, the USPTO issued its final decision invalidating 23 of the 25 claims asserted in the '556 Patent, as noted above. We believe that the suit filed by Utility is without merit and we will vigorously defend the claims asserted against us. An adverse resolution of the foregoing litigation or patent proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The Court stayed all proceedings with respect to this lawsuit pending the outcome of the patent review performed by the USPTO and the appellate court. Based on the USPTO's final decision to invalidate substantially all claims contained in the '556 patent, we intend to file for summary judgment in our favor if Utility does not request outright dismissal.\nThe Company received notice in April 2015 that TASER International, Inc. ( Taser\u201d), one of our competitors, had commenced an action in the USPTO for a re-examination of our U.S. Patent No. 8,781,292 ( the '292 Patent). A re-examination is essentially a request that the USPTO review whether the patent should have issued in its present form in view of the prior art,\u201d e.g., other patents in the same technology field. The prior art used by Taser to request the re-examination is a patent application (which never issued into a patent) assigned to an unrelated third party and was not the result of any of Taser's own research and development efforts.\nOur '292 Patent is directed to a system that determines when a recording device, such as a law enforcement officer's body camera or in-car video recorder, begins recording and automatically instructs other recording devices to begin recording. The technology described in the '292 Patent is incorporated in our VuLink product.\nOn August 17, 2015 the USPTO issued a first, non-final action rejecting all 20 claims of the '292 Patent respecting our'292 Patent, which was undergoing an ex parte re-examination. We were provided the opportunity to discuss the merits of the prior art and the scope of the patent claims with the patent Examiner handling the reexamination and to amend the patent claims. On January 14, 2016 the USPTO ultimately rejected Taser's efforts and confirmed the validity of the '292 patent with 59 claims covering various aspects of our auto-activation technology. On February 2, 2016 the USPTO issued another patent relating our auto-activation technology for law enforcement cameras. U.S. Patent No. 9,253,452 ( the '452 patent\u201d) generally covers the automatic activation and coordination of multiple recording devices in response to a triggering event such as a law enforcement officer activating the light bar on the vehicle.\nThe Company filed suit on January 15, 2016 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas (Case No: 2:16-cv-02032) against Taser, alleging that Taser willfully infringed the '292 Patent by selling and offering to sell its Axon camera product line and Signal Performance Power Magazine. The lawsuit was initiated after the USPTO reconfirmed the validity of the '292 patent. On February 2, 2016, we amended our complaint against Taser, further alleging that Taser is directly and indirectly liable for infringing the '452 Patent. Our amended complaint seeks both monetary damages and a permanent injunction against Taser for infringing both the '452 and '292 Patents.\nIn addition to the '452 Patent infringement claims, the February 2, 2016 amended complaint added a new set of claims to the lawsuit alleging that Taser conspired to keep us out of the marketplace by engaging in improper, unethical, and unfair competition. The amended lawsuit alleges Taser bribed officials and otherwise conspired to secure no-bid contracts for its products in violation of both state law and federal antitrust law. Our lawsuit also seeks monetary and injunctive relief, including treble damages, for these alleged violations.\nOn February 19, 2016 TASER asked for and was granted an extension of time to answer or otherwise plead to the complaint alleging willful patent infringement, the bribery of officials and otherwise conspired to secure no-bid contracts for its products in violation of both state law and federal antitrust law. On March 4, 2016, TASER filed a motion to dismiss our complaint which is now pending before the court.\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn or about May 22, 2014, Stephen Gans, a former director and former principal shareholder of us, filed a complaint in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada that asserts claims against us and Stanton E. Ross, Leroy C. Richie, Daniel F. Hutchins and Elliot M. Kaplan (the Defendant Directors\u201d), who are members of its Board of Directors. We were served with the complaint on May 28, 2014. Among other things, the complaint alleged (i) that the Defendant Directors breached their fiduciary duties by failing to consider a financing proposal offered by Mr. Gans and his affiliates; and (ii) that the Defendant Directors, acting at the direction of Stanton E. Ross, did not independently and objectively evaluate Mr. Gans' protestations about certain alleged transactions between us and Infinity Energy Resources, Inc., and by so doing, breached their fiduciary duties. We and the Defendant Directors vigorously defended the claims asserted against us and them. We and the Defendant Directors filed a response denying all of the plaintiff's allegations and have asserted counter-claims that allege that Gans committed improper acts that included: (a) failing to disclose the nature and substance of an SEC investigation of Gans; (b) engaging in potential insider trading; (c) misappropriating our confidential information; (d) attempting to use his position as a director to personally enrich himself; and (e) making unauthorized, misleading, and factually inaccurate filings to the SEC about us.\nOn December 11, 2014, the parties agreed in principle to compromise and dismiss with prejudice substantially all of their claims. Within the scope of that settlement are each of the shareholder derivative claims\u201d that Gans had asserted against us and the Defendant Directors. The settlement to which the parties agreed resulted in no monetary recovery by any party. On April 7, 2015 the Court approved the settlement of all shareholder derivative claims.\nWe are also involved as a plaintiff and defendant in ordinary, routine litigation and administrative proceedings incidental to its business from time to time, including customer collections, vendor and employment-related matters. We believe that the likely outcome of any other pending cases and proceedings will not be material to our business or financial condition.\nSponsorship. On April 16, 2015 we entered into a Title Sponsorship Agreement under which we became the title sponsor for a Web.com Tour golf tournament (the Tournament\u201d) held annually in the Kansas City Metropolitan area. Such Agreement provides us with naming rights and other benefits for the 2015 through 2019 annual Tournament in exchange for the following sponsorship fee:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>Year </td> <td> </td> <td>Sponsorship fee </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>375,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>475,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>475,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have the right to sell and retain the proceeds from the sale of additional sponsorships, including but not limited to a presenting sponsorship, a concert sponsorship and founding partnerships for the Tournament. We recorded a net sponsorship expense of $173,335 relating to the 2015 Tournament during the year ended December 31, 2015. Such expense was included in sales and promotional expense in the accompanying statement of operations.\nStock Repurchase Program. On August 25, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $2.5 million of the Company's common stock in the open market, or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchases, if and when made, will be subject to market conditions, applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other factors. The repurchase program will be funded using a portion of cash and cash equivalents, along with cash flow from operations. Purchases may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time. We have not repurchased any shares under this program as of December 31, 2015.\n(k) Plan. We sponsor a 401(k) retirement savings plan for the benefit of our employees. The plan, as amended, requires us to provide 100% matching contributions for employees, who elect to contribute up to 3% of their compensation to the plan and 50% matching contributions for employee's elective deferrals on the next 2% of their contributions. We made matching contributions totaling $163,227 and $156,071 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Each participant is 100% vested at all times in employee and employer matching contributions.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1, Financial Statements\u201d, of this report. While the selection and application of any accounting policy may involve some level of subjective judgments and estimates, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to our financial statements, potentially involve the most subjective judgments in their selection and application, and are the most susceptible to uncertainties and changing conditions:\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Revenue Recognition / Allowance for Doubtful Accounts; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Allowance for Excess and Obsolete Inventory; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Warranty Reserves; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Stock-based Compensation Expense; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Accounting for Income Taxes; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Determination of Fair Value Calculation for Financial Instruments and Derivatives. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition / Allowances for Doubtful Accounts. Revenue is recognized for the shipment of products or delivery of service when all four of the following conditions are met:\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(i) </td> <td>Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>(ii) </td> <td>Delivery has occurred; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>(iii) </td> <td>The price is fixed or determinable; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>(iv) </td> <td>Collectability is reasonably assured. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe review all significant, unusual or nonstandard shipments of product or delivery of services as a routine part of our accounting and financial reporting process to determine compliance with these requirements. Extended warranties are offered on selected products and when a customer purchases an extended warranty the associated proceeds are treated as deferred revenue and recognized over the term of the extended warranty.\nOur principal customers are state, local and federal law enforcement agencies, which historically have been low risks for uncollectible accounts. We also have commercial customers and international distributors who may present a greater risk for uncollectible accounts than such law enforcement customers and we consider a specific reserve for bad debts based on their individual circumstances. Our historical bad debts have been negligible, with less than $195,000 charged off as uncollectible on cumulative revenues of $185.8 million since we commenced deliveries during 2006. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had provided a reserve for doubtful accounts of $74,997 and $65,977, respectively.\nWe periodically perform a specific review of significant individual receivables outstanding for risk of loss due to uncollectibility. Based on such review, we consider our reserve for doubtful accounts to be adequate as of December 31, 2015. However, if the balance due from any significant customer ultimately becomes uncollectible, then our allowance for bad debts will not be sufficient to cover the charge-off and we will be required to record additional bad debt expense in our statement of operations.\nAllowance for Excess and Obsolete Inventory. We record valuation reserves on our inventory for estimated excess or obsolete inventory items. The amount of the reserve is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. On a quarterly basis, management performs an analysis of the underlying inventory to identify reserves needed for excess and obsolescence. We use our best judgment to estimate appropriate reserves based on this analysis. In addition, we adjust the carrying value of inventory if the current market value of that inventory is below its cost.\nInventories consisted of the following at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Raw material and component parts </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,833,873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,987,124 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Work-in-process </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134,641 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>280,429 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Finished goods </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,895,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,576,480 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Subtotal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,864,177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,844,033 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Reserve for excess and obsolete inventory </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,202,411 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(600,578 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,661,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,243,455 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to our customers against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to changing technology and customer requirements. As reflected above, our inventory reserves represented 10.1% of the gross inventory balance at December 31, 2015, compared to 6.1% of the gross inventory balance at December 31, 2014. We had $1,202,411 and $600,578 in reserves for obsolete and excess inventories at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Total raw materials and component parts were $3,833,873 and $2,987,124 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, an increase of $846,749 (28%). The increase in raw materials and component parts is primarily attributable to increased forecasts of sales for the FirstVU HD and the need to secure long lead component inventory items in advance of production. Finished goods balances were $7,895,663 and $6,576,480 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, an increase of $1,319,183 (20%). The increase in finished goods was primarily in DVM-750 products and additional cameras for our various products. Finished goods at December 31, 2015 consist primarily of the Laser Ally products, normal levels of our DVM-500 Plus product and the increased DVM-750 product inventories in anticipation of the closing of several significant international contracts. The increase in the inventory reserve is primarily due to the change in sales mix of our products which has resulted in a higher level of excess component parts of the older versions of our legacy products. We believe the reserves are appropriate given our inventory levels at December 31, 2015.\nIf actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or significant engineering changes to our products that are not anticipated and appropriately managed, additional inventory write-downs may be required in excess of the inventory reserves already established.\nWarranty Reserves. We generally provide up to a two-year parts and labor warranty on our products to our customers. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims. We actively study trends of claims and take action to improve product quality and minimize claims. Our warranty reserves were decreased to $159,838 as of December 31, 2015 compared to $247,082 as of December 31, 2014. We have limited experience with the FirstVU HD and DVM-800 and will monitor our reserve for all warranty claims related to these two newer products. There is a risk that we will have higher warranty claim frequency rates and average cost of claims than our history has indicated on our legacy mirror products on our new products for which we have limited experience. Actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods.\nStock-based Compensation Expense. We grant stock options to our employees and directors and such benefits provided are share-based payment awards which require us to make significant estimates related to determining the value of our share-based compensation. In 2015, we issued no stock options as we continued our trend of issuing restricted common shares subject to vesting requirements. As such, stock based compensation is now based upon the grant date market value of the restricted shares which is an objective measure.\nAccounting for Income Taxes. Accounting for income taxes requires significant estimates and judgments on the part of management. Such estimates and judgments include, but are not limited to, the effective tax rate anticipated to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future, the sufficiency of taxable income in future periods to realize the benefits of net deferred tax assets and net operating losses currently recorded and the likelihood that tax positions taken in tax returns will be sustained on audit.\nAs required by authoritative guidance, we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Authoritative guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2014, cumulative valuation allowances in the amount of $12,692,000 were recorded in connection with the net deferred income tax assets. Based on a review of our deferred tax assets and recent operating performance, we determined that our valuation allowance should be increased to $18,105,000 to fully reserve our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2015. We determined that it was appropriate to continue to provide a full valuation reserve on our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 because of the overall net operating loss carryforwards available. We expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets. To the extent we determine that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not based upon expected future taxable income, a portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed. Such a reversal would be recorded as an income tax benefit and, for some portion related to deductions for stock option exercises, an increase in shareholders' equity.\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs required by authoritative guidance, we have performed a comprehensive review of our portfolio of uncertain tax positions in accordance with recognition standards established by the FASB, an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return, that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. We have no recorded liability as of December 31, 2015 representing uncertain tax positions.\nWe have generated substantial deferred income tax assets related to our operations primarily from the charge to compensation expense taken for stock options, certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards. For us to realize the income tax benefit of these assets, we must generate sufficient taxable income in future periods when such deductions are allowed for income tax purposes. In some cases where deferred taxes were the result of compensation expense recognized on stock options, our ability to realize the income tax benefit of these assets is also dependent on our share price increasing to a point where these options have intrinsic value at least equal to the grant date fair value and are exercised. In assessing whether a valuation allowance is needed in connection with our deferred income tax assets, we have evaluated our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to utilize the benefit of the deferred income tax assets. We continue to evaluate our ability to use recorded deferred income tax asset balances. If we fail to generate taxable income for financial reporting in future years, no additional tax benefit would be recognized for those losses, since we will not have accumulated enough positive evidence to support our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards in the future. Therefore, we may be required to increase our valuation allowance in future periods should our assumptions regarding the generation of future taxable income not be realized.\nDetermination of Fair Value for Financial Instruments and Derivatives. During 2014 in two separate transactions we issued a total of $6.0 million of Secured Convertible Notes with detachable warrants to purchase common stock. We elected to record the Secured Convertible Notes on their fair value basis. In addition, the warrants to purchase common stock contained anti-dilution provisions that required them to be accounted for as derivative liabilities. We were required to determine the fair value of these financial instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 for financial reporting purposes. The entire principal balance of the Secured Convertible Notes had been converted and all warrants had been exercised, except for warrants to acquire 12,200 common shares at $7.32 per share, as of December 31, 2015.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820\u201d), we utilize the market approach to measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, liabilities or a group of assets or liabilities, such as a business.\nASC 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Level 2 - Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Level 3 - Significant unobservable inputs (including the Company's own assumptions in determining the fair value) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table represents our hierarchy for our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Level 1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Level 2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Level 3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Warrant derivative liability </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,053 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,053 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,053 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,053 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInflation and Seasonality\nInflation has not materially affected us during the past fiscal year. We do not believe that our business is seasonal in nature; however, we generally generate higher revenues during the second half of the calendar year compared to the first half.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

We have the ability to integrate electronic, radio, computer, mechanical, and multi-media technologies to create unique solutions to our customers' requests. We began shipping our flagship digital video mirror product in March 2006. We have developed additional products to complement our DVM-500 and DVM-750, our original in-car digital video products, including lower priced in-car digital video mirrors (the DVM-100, DVM-400, DVM-800 and MicroVU HD), and body worn camera (FirstVU HD) products designed for law enforcement usage. Since 2011 we have launched the following new products: the FirstVU HD; DVM-800; the MicroVU HD; the patented VuLink product which integrates our body-worn cameras with our in-car systems by providing hands-free automatic activation; and the new line of digital video mirrors (the DVM-250 and DVM-250 Plus) that serve as event recorders\u201d for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets in order to expand our customer base beyond the traditional law enforcement agencies. We have additional research and development projects that we anticipate will result in several new product launches in 2016. We believe that the launch of these new products will help to diversify and broaden the market for our product offerings.\n 16 \n \nWe experienced operating losses for all of the quarters during 2015 and 2014.

These variations result from the timing of large individual orders and the traction gained by our new products, such as the FirstVU HD, MicroVU HD, FleetVU and DVM-800. We reported an operating loss of $2,700,529 on revenues of $5,051,119 for fourth quarter 2015 compared to an operating loss of $2,140,785 on revenues of $5,096,088 for third quarter 2015, an operating loss of $816,962 on revenues of $5,634,237 for second quarter 2015, and an operating loss of $1,963,195 on revenues of $4,248,764 for first quarter 2015. Our fourth quarter 2015 revenues decreased slightly from third quarter 2015. Our gross margin percentage decreased to 31.0% in the fourth quarter from 40.0% in the third quarter 2015 and 54.9% in the second quarter 2015. During the third quarter 2015, we decided to upgrade the connectors contained in the camera cable assembly on our FirstVU HD product to improve functionality and reliability. This upgrade was applied to all deployed units in the field as well as in our inventory, which required us to rework the camera assemblies and scrap a portion of the original cable assembly. Total scrap costs recognized in third and fourth quarter 2015 approximated $1,615,000, which adversely affected our gross margins and other operating results. Management believes the FirstVU HD connector upgrade implemented to all deployed units during the third and fourth quarter 2015 will resolve the cable assembly issue and that gross margins should return to more normal levels in future quarters. Our selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses were higher in the fourth quarter 2015 compared to the first three quarters of 2015. The primary reason for the increased SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter 2015 over the three prior quarters of 2015 was the addition of technical support staff to handle field inquiries and installation matters because our installed customer base has expanded and additional technical support staff required for our new products, such as the FirstVU HD and DVM-800. Many of our customers require extensive information technology infrastructure planning to manage and store the audio/video evidence gathered by our systems, which often requires new and larger data servers. Our international revenues during 2015 decreased to $148,667 from $961,763 in 2014.\n 17 \n \nThere have been a number of factors and trends affecting our recent performance, which include:\n \u25cf Revenues decreased in fourth quarter 2015 to $5,051,119 from $5,096,088 in third quarter 2015 and $5,634,237 in second quarter 2015. We believe the decline in revenues in the fourth quarter 2015 and third quarter 2015 was attributable to a competitor, TASER International, Inc. ( Taser\u201d) stating in one of its press releases that all the claims in one of our patents were determined to be unpatentable.\u201d We believe its press release was misleading and incorrect, causing confusion and concern in our marketplace, customer base and potential customers. Taser commenced an action in the United States Patent & Trademark Office ( USPTO\u201d) for a reexamination of our U.S. Patent No. 8,781,292 (the '292 Patent\u201d). A reexamination is essentially a request that the USPTO review whether the patent should have issued in its present form in view of the prior art,\u201d e.g., other patents in the same technology field. The '292 Patent relates to the \u2018automatic trigger\u201d that allows our body camera and our in-car system to automatically begin recording without the need for law enforcement officers to manually turn them on. The automatic trigger covered by our '292 Patent is incorporated in our VuLink product. Such product has been popular and consequently the confusion and misinformation caused by our competitor has impacted our revenues of our VuLink product and body-worn and in-car systems. Ultimately, the USPTO rejected Taser's efforts and reconfirmed the validity of the '292 patent on January 16, 2016 and we have filed suit alleging willful patent infringement against Taser and included claims of commercial bribery and other unfair trade practices. See Litigation for details. \u25cf Recognizing a critical limitation in law enforcement camera technology, during 2014 we pioneered the development of our VuLink ecosystem that provided intuitive auto-activation functionality as well as coordination between multiple recording devices. The USPTO has recognized these pioneering efforts by granting us multiple patents with claims covering numerous features, such as automatically activating an officer's cameras when the light bar is activated or a data-recording device such as a smart weapon is activated. Additionally, Digital Ally's patent claims cover automatic coordination between multiple recording devices. Prior to this work, officers were forced to manually activate each device while responding to emergency scenarios - a requirement that both decreased the usefulness of the existing camera systems and diverted officers' attention during critical moments. We are seeing a trend in which law enforcement agencies have recognized the value of our VuLink technology and are seeking information on auto-activation\u201d features in requests for bids and requests for information involving the procurement process of body-worn cameras and in-car systems. We believe this trend may result in our patented VuLink technology becoming the de-facto standard\u201d for agencies engaged in deploying state-of-the-art body-worn and in-car camera systems. We expect that this technology will have a significant impact on our revenues in the long-term particularly if we are successful in our prosecution of the patent infringement litigation currently pending with Taser. \u25cf We believe recently highly publicized law enforcement incidents have provided federal, state and municipal governments with an opportunity to reassess spending priorities, moving from the militarization of the police to increasing transparency and accountability. This underlying shift in priorities has redirected and increased law enforcement budgets and funding to our products and offerings. We are hopeful this trend continues into 2016 and beyond. In that regard, our FirstVU body-worn camera revenues increased to 20% of total 2015 revenues from 11% of revenues in 2014. \u25cf We have launched additional products to complement our legacy in-car video products for law enforcement agencies in an effort to diversify our sources of revenue to new market channels. In that regard, we have expanded our product offerings to include incident recorders designed to meet commercial fleet owners' needs. We believe these commercial fleet offerings will be appealing to prospective customers who want to monitor, manage and train their drivers and to provide liability protection. Such fleet customers may include ambulance service providers, taxicab fleets, limousine services, off-premises airport parking services, over the road trucks and others who maintain a fleet of vehicles. We expect that our commercial fleet business will be a significant growth provider for us in the future. Revenues derived from our commercial business reached to 10% of total revenues in 2015 compared to 5% for 2014. \u25cf Our gross margin percentage decreased to 31.0% in the fourth quarter 2015 from 40.0% in the third quarter, 54.9% in the second quarter and 38.9% in the first quarter of 2015. Our gross margin decline is primarily attributable to the camera cable connector upgrade implemented in the third and fourth quarter 2015 to our FirstVU HD product that caused us to rework our entire installed base of FirstVU HD's and scrap a portion of the original cable assembly. This upgrade contributed to total scrap costs approximating $1,615,000 that adversely affected our fourth and third quarter 2015 gross margins. Management believes the FirstVU HD connector upgrade implemented to all deployed units during the third quarter and fourth quarter 2015 will resolve the cable assembly issue and that gross margins should return to more normal levels in future quarters. \u25cf Our international revenues were less than expected for the year ends December 31, 2015 and 2014, with total international revenues of $148,667 (1% of total revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $961,763 (6% of total revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014. Unfavorable changes in the foreign exchange rate in many countries have impacted our international sales. We were disappointed in our international revenues given the high level of bidding activity. We provided bids to a number of international customers; however, international sale cycles generally take longer than domestic business. We are hopeful that our new products will appeal to international customers, in particular the DVM-800 and FirstVU HD, although we can make no assurances in this regard. \n 18 \n \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations) or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have material current or future effect on financial conditions, changes in the financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or significant components of revenue or expenses.\nWe are a party to operating leases, title sponsorship, and license agreements that represent commitments for future payments (described in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements) and we have issued purchase orders in the ordinary course of business that represent commitments to future payments for goods and services.\nFor the

Revenue is recorded when the product is shipped to the end customer. \u25cf Sales to international customers are made through independent distributors who purchase products from us at a wholesale price and sell to the end user (typically law enforcement agencies or a commercial customer) at a retail price. The distributor retains the margin as its compensation for its role in the transaction. The distributor generally maintains product inventory, customer receivables and all related risks and rewards of ownership. Revenue is recorded when the product is shipped to the distributor consistent with the terms of the distribution agreement. \u25cf Repair parts and services for domestic and international customers are generally handled by our inside customer service employees. Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the repair parts and acceptance of the service or materials by the end customer. \nWe may discount our prices on specific orders when considering the size of the order, the specific customer and the competitive landscape. We believe that our systems are cost competitive compared to our principal competitors and generally are lower priced when considering comparable features and capabilities.\n 20 \n \nRevenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were derived from the following sources:\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>DVM-800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FirstVu HD and FirstVu </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>DVM-250 & DVM- 250 Plus </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>DVM-100 & DVM-400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>DVM-500 Plus </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>VuLink </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>DVM-750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Laser Ally </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Repair and service </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accessories and other revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe experienced a change in the sales mix of our products for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Our newer products, the DVM-800 and the FirstVU HD, contributed 56% of total sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, compared to 51% for the comparable period ending December 31, 2014. We expect the sales mix will continue to transition from our legacy M-500 Plus and DVM -750 product lines to the newer products during 2016. In addition, our commercial event recorders increased from 5% to 10% of total revenues. We expect this trend to continue because of the appeal of our new FleetVU driver management and monitoring tool.\nRevenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $20,030,208 and $17,444,419, respectively, an increase of $2,585,789 (15%), due to the following factors:\n \u25cf Our revenues increased significantly for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 (15%). We believe the improvement is attributable to the increased attention to the benefits of video evidence caused by the civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri and other cities in the United States and the features of our newer products. We have had a large increase in inquiries, test and evaluation units for our FirstVU and DVM-800 products in our pilot programs for prospective clients since the events in Ferguson, Missouri and elsewhere and are hopeful these will culminate in sales as the potential customers evaluate our body-worn and in-car video camera solutions. We believe that there has been a shift in buying patterns of our customers to emphasize our products because of the transparency and accountability they provide to the general public. \u25cf We shipped twenty-two individual orders in excess of $100,000, for a total of approximately $3,727,000 in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to six individual orders in excess of $100,000, for a total of approximately $2,500,000 in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. Eight of the large orders were for a package including our in-car video system, our FirstVU body worn camera and our patented VULink connectivity system. Additionally, six of the large orders were for our commercial event recorders and most of those orders included our FleetVu driver management and monitoring tool. Our average order size increased to approximately $3,060 in the year ended December 31, 2015 from $2,615 during the year ended September 30, 2014. \u25cf The DVM-800 and FirstVU HD, introduced in 2013, contributed 56% of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 51% for the comparable period ending December 31, 2014. We expect the sales mix will continue to migrate from the DVM 500-Plus and DVM-750 product lines to the newer products in 2016. \u25cf Our international revenues decreased to $148,667, representing 1% of total revenues, during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $961,763, representing 6% of total revenues, during the year ended December 31, 2014. Our international revenues during 2015 were negatively impacted by the unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates for our international customers. In particular the Mexican peso exchange rate deterioration has delayed purchases by several of our largest customers and opportunities. We were disappointed in our international revenues given the high level of bidding activity. We have provided bids to a number of international customers; however, international sale cycles generally take longer than domestic business. We also believe that our new products may appeal to international customers, in particular the DVM-800 and FirstVU HD, although we can make no assurances in this regard. \n 21 \n \nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue on units sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $11,680,853 and $7,521,626, respectively, an increase of $4,159,227 (55%). The increase in cost of goods sold is partially due to the 15% increase in revenues. In addition, we encountered printed circuit board issues in our FirstVU HD body-worn cameras early in 2015 and in response upgraded the entire installed base of FirstVUs in the third and fourth quarter 2015. The upgrade involved the replacement of a connector contained in the camera cable assembly on our FirstVU HD product that dramatically increased rework and scrap rates on our FirstVU HD. Our scrap costs were approximately $1,615,000 for third and fourth quarter 2015. We also increased our inventory reserve in 2015 due to changes in the sales mix to the DVM-800 platform, which has resulted in a higher level of excess component parts of older versions of our legacy products. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased to 58% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 43% for the year ended December 31, 2014. We believe that the FirstVU HD connector upgrade implemented to all deployed units during the third and fourth quarter 2015 will resolve the cable assembly issue and that gross margins should return to more normal levels in 2016. Our goal is to maintain cost of sales as a percentage of revenues at 40% or less during 2016. We expect that our newer product offerings, in particular the DVM-800, VuLink and FirstVU HD, should improve our cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales in the longer term. We do not expect to incur significant capital expenditures to ramp up production of our current products because our internal process is largely assembling subcomponents, testing and shipping of completed products or we use contract manufacturers. We rely on our subcontractors to produce finished circuit boards that represent the primary components of our products, thereby reducing our need to purchase capital equipment.\nWe had $1,202,411 and $600,578 in reserves for obsolete and excess inventories at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Total raw materials and component parts were $3,833,873 and $2,987,124 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, an increase of $846,749 (28%). The increase in raw materials and component parts is primarily attributable to our forecasts of sales for the FirstVU HD, and VuLink and the need to secure long lead component inventory items in advance of production. Finished goods balances were $7,895,663 and $6,576,480 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, an increase of $1,319,183 (20%). The increase in finished goods was primarily for the DVM-750 product for anticipated international customer orders and additional cameras for our various products. Finished goods at December 31, 2015 consist primarily of the Laser Ally products and our DVM-500 Plus and DVM-750 products for expected orders. The increase in the inventory reserve is primarily due to the change in sales mix of our products which has resulted in a higher level of excess component parts of the older versions of our legacy products. We believe the reserves are appropriate given our inventory levels at December 31, 2015.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $8,349,355 and $9,922,793, respectively, a decrease of $1,573,438 (16%). The decrease is a result of the cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increasing to 58% during the year ended December 31, 2015 from 43% for the year ended December 31, 2014 offset by the 15% increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our goal is to improve our margins to 60% over the longer term based on the expected margins of our newer products, in particular the DVM-800 and FirstVU HD, as they continue to gain traction in the marketplace and we increase commercial production in 2016. In addition, as revenues increase from these products, we will seek to further improve our margins from them through economies of scale and more efficiently utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components. We plan to continue our initiative on more efficient management of our supply chain through outsourcing production, quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices.\n 22 \n \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $15,970,826 and $12,811,987 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $3,158,839 (25%). Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 80% in 2015 from 74% in 2014. The significant components of selling, general and administrative expenses are as follows:\nThe significant components of selling, general and administrative expenses are as follows:\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,980,807 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,905,407 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selling, advertising and promotional expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,965,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,340,764 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock-based compensation expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,623,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>834,593 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional fees and expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,368,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,153,985 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Executive, sales, and administrative staff payroll </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,941,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,012,552 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,091,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,564,686 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,970,826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,811,987 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expense. We continue to focus on bringing new products to market, including updates and improvements to current products. Our research and development expenses totaled $2,980,807 and $2,905,407 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $75,400 (3%). We employed a total of 25 engineers at December 31, 2015 compared to 22 engineers at December 31, 2014, most of whom are dedicated to research and development activities for new products. We are increasing our engineering staff of web-based developers as we expand our offerings to include cloud-based evidence storage and management for our law enforcement customers (VuVault.net) and our web-based commercial fleet driver monitoring and management tool (FleetVU). Research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 15% in 2015 compared to 17% in 2014. We have active research and development projects on several new products, as well as upgrades to our existing product lines. We consider our research and development capabilities and new product focus to be a competitive advantage and will continue to invest in this area on a prudent basis.\nSelling, advertising and promotional expenses. Selling, advertising and promotional expense totaled $3,965,400 and $3,340,764 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $624,636 (19%). Salaries and commissions to our sales personnel represent the primary components of these costs and were $3,116,729 and $2,729,589 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $387,140 (14%), which is commensurate with our 15% increase in revenues. The effective commission rate was 15.6% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nPromotional and advertising expenses totaled $848,671 during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $611,175 during the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $237,496 (39%). The increase is primarily attributable to the Company becoming the title sponsor of the Web.com Tour golf tournament held annually in the Kansas City Metropolitan area. Our net promotional expense related to sponsorship of the 2015 tournament totaled $172,623. Additionally, we had increased participation in trade shows and media advertising in trade publications and other marketing initiatives designed to help penetrate commercial markets for our DVM-250 Plus event recorders, and to increase awareness of our FirstVU HD, MicroVu HD, VuLink and the DVM-800 within our law enforcement channel during 2015.\nStock-based compensation expense. Stock based compensation expense totaled $1,623,033 and $834,593 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $788,440 (94%). The increase is primarily due to the amortization of the restricted stock granted during 2015 to our officers, directors, and other employees that had the effect of increasing the stock compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. The total number of restricted shares granted and our market stock price was higher on the specific dates of the 2015 stock grants compared to previous years, which increased the grant date fair value attributable to the restricted stock grants.\nThe total number of restricted shares granted to the Board of Directors, officers and employees increased to 326,500 shares during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 192,500 shares during the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, the weighted average grant date price of the shares increased to $8.42 per share compared to $5.33 per share during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nProfessional fees and expense. Professional fees and expenses totaled $1,368,758 and $1,153,985 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $214,773 (19%). Professional fees during 2014 and 2015 were related primarily to normal public company matters, intellectual property matters and litigation matters. The increase in professional fees and expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to higher accounting fees and litigation expenses related to the Utility and Taser matters. See Litigation for further discussion.\n 23 \n \nExecutive, sales and administrative staff payroll. Executive, sales and administrative staff payroll expenses totaled $2,941,151 and $2,012,552 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $928,599 (46%). This increase is primarily attributable to the hiring of additional technical support staff to handle field inquiries and installation matters because our installed customer base has expanded and the need for additional technical support staff for our new products, such as the DVM-800, FirstVU HD, VuVault.com and FleetVU. In addition, the Company established a bonus plan during 2015, which resulted in approximately $260,000 in compensation expense and the Company incurred an increase of approximately $250,000 in employee-based retention expenses.\nOther. Other selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $3,091,677 and $2,564,686 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $526,991 (21%). The increase in other expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to increased consulting, contract labor and insurance expenses. We are utilizing consultants to help develop engineering and manufacturing standard processes with a goal of achieving ISO 13485, ISO 9001, FDA cGMPs, and MD Directive 93/42/EEC certifications. We also utilized consultants to help design, develop and launch a new corporate website in 2015.\nOperating Loss\nFor the reasons previously stated, our operating loss was $7,621,471 and $2,889,194 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a deterioration of $4,732,277 (164%). Operating loss as a percentage of revenues increased to 38% in 2015 from 17% in 2014.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased to $21,156 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $13,660 in 2014. The increase is attributable to an increase in average cash and cash equivalents balances related to our $12.0 million registered direct offering which was completed in July 2015.\nChange in Warrant Derivative Liabilities\nDetachable warrants to purchase a total of 398,916 common shares, as adjusted, were issued in conjunction with the Secured Convertible Notes ( Secured Convertible Notes\u201d) during March and August 2014. The warrants were required to be treated as derivative liabilities because of their anti-dilution and down-round provisions. Accordingly, we estimated the fair value of such warrants as of their respective date of issuance and record a corresponding derivative liability in the balance sheet. Upon exercise of the warrants we recognized a gain/loss based on the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise. In addition, the warrant derivative liability is adjusted to the estimated fair value of any unexercised warrants as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nThe holder of the Secured Convertible Notes exercised a portion of such warrants in August 2014 and in September 2014 with the change in value of the warrant derivative totaling $3,233,068 being recognized as a non-cash charge to operations during the year ended December 31, 2014 representing the increase in our stock price over the exercise price at the respective exercise dates. The changes in the fair value of the warrant derivatives related to unexercised warrants totaled $1,193,694 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in warrant derivative liabilities totaled $4,426,762 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the warrant derivative liability balance was $2,186,214 as of December 31, 2014.\nThe holder of the Secured Convertible Notes exercised a portion of its warrants in March 2015 and April 2015 with the change in value of the warrant derivative through the date of exercise resulting in a gain of $336,373 compared to the estimated warrant derivative liability balance. The resulting derivative balance of $1,748,155 was offset against the warrant derivative liability during the year ended December 31, 2015. The changes in the fair value of the warrant derivatives related to unexercised warrants resulted in a gain of $34,633 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The change in warrant derivative liabilities resulted in a gain of $371,006 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the warrant derivative liability balance was $67,053 as of December 31, 2015.\n 24 \n \nChange in Fair Value of Secured Convertible Notes Payable\nWe elected to account for and record the Secured Convertible Notes on their fair value basis. The holder of the Secured Convertible Notes exercised its right to convert such notes to 316,716 common shares during July 2014 through September 2014. The change in fair market value of the Secured Convertible Notes associated with the conversion of debt was $384,614 during the year ended December 31, 2014, representing the increase in our stock price over the conversion price as of the respective conversion dates. On December 4, 2014, the holder of the Secured Convertible Note exercised its right to convert $36,600 principal amount into 6,000 shares of our common stock at the conversion price of $6.10 per share. The increase in fair market value of these 6,000 shares over the $36,600 principal retired was $89,400, representing the increase in our stock price over the conversion price as of the conversion date. As of December 31, 2014 the fair market value of the remaining Secured Convertible Note was $3,273,431 representing a change in fair market value for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaling $302,552. Accordingly, the total change in fair value of the two Secured Convertible Notes payable was $776,566 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe holder of the Secured Convertible Notes exercised its right to convert the remaining principal balance of such Notes into 655,738 shares of common stock and 5,475 shares for accrued interest thereon at a conversion price of $7.32 per share in separate transactions between February 13 and 25, 2015. The increase in fair market value of the 655,213 shares over the $3,963,780 principal retired was $4,434,383, representing the increase in our stock price over the conversion price as of the conversion dates. Accordingly, the total change in fair value of the Secured Convertible Notes payable was a $4,434,383 loss for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nSecured Convertible Notes Issuance Expenses\nWe elected to account for and record our Secured Convertible Notes on a fair value basis. Accordingly, we were required to expense the related issuance costs to other expense which totaled $93,845 and $579,066 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 2015 expenses were attributable to the proxy costs incurred for our Special Meeting of Shareholders held on February 13, 2015 to approve the issuance of shares above the Nasdaq Share Cap in connection with the issuance of the Secured Convertible Note in August 2014. The December 31, 2014 expenses included a $360,000 placement agent fee and the remainder was primarily legal fees.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income increased to $1,878 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from ($5,589) in 2014.\nInterest Expense\nWe incurred interest expense of $282,233 and $499,744 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $217,511 (44%). We issued an aggregate of $2.5 million principal amount of subordinated notes during 2011, which bore interest at the rate of 8% per annum until the notes were paid in full on July 24, 2015. On March 24, 2014, we issued the $2.0 million Secured Convertible Note that remained outstanding until its full conversion in three separate tranches between July 1, 2014 and September 19, 2014. On August 28, 2014, we issued the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note bearing interest at the rate of 6% per annum that remained outstanding until its full conversion in eight separate tranches between February 13, 2015 and February 25, 2015.\nWe amortized to interest expense $55,187 and $132,447, representing the discount associated with the $2.5 million subordinated note during years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The total remaining unamortized discount was $0 and $55,187 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nLoss before Income Tax Benefit\nAs a result of the above, we reported a loss before income tax benefit of $12,037,892 and $9,163,261 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a deterioration of $2,874,631 (31%).\nIncome Tax Benefit\nWe did not record an income tax benefit related to our losses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, due to our overall net operating loss carryforwards available. We have further determined to continue providing a full valuation reserve on our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015. During 2015, we increased our valuation reserve on deferred tax assets by $5,413,000 whereby our deferred tax assets continue to be fully reserved due to our recent operating losses.\n 25 \n \nWe had approximately $30,700,000 of net operating loss carryforwards and $1,747,000 of research and development tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2015 available to offset future net taxable income.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the above, we reported net losses of $12,037,892 and $9,163,261 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a deterioration of $2,874,631 (31%).\nBasic and Diluted Loss per Share\nThe basic and diluted loss per share was $2.77 and $3.54 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for the reasons previously noted. All outstanding stock options were considered antidilutive and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 because of the net loss reported for each period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverall:\nDuring 2011, we borrowed a total of $2.5 million under an unsecured credit facility with a private, third-party lender. The $2.5 million of subordinated notes bore interest at the rate of 8% per annum and are payable interest only on a monthly basis. The subordinated notes were subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness; as such term is defined in the Notes. On December 4, 2013, we entered into an agreement with the lender that extended the maturity dates of the subordinated notes from May 30, 2014 to May 30, 2015, which was later extended to August 15, 2015. The subordinated notes were unsecured and did not prevent us from obtaining new senior secured financings. On July 24, 2015, we paid the entire $2.5 million of outstanding principal together with all accrued interest in full.\nOn March 24, 2014, we completed a private placement of the $2.0 million Secured Convertible Note, which bore interest at 6% per annum, payable quarterly, and was secured by all of our assets. In addition, we issued the holder detachable warrants to acquire 130,000 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share (the March 2014 Warrant\u201d). On July 10, 2014 we and the holder of the $2.0 million Secured Convertible Note entered into an agreement under which we reduced the conversion price of the Senior Secured Note to $6.25 per share during the period from July 11 to July 14, 2014. During the foregoing period the holder converted $1,777,778 principal amount and $2,963 accrued interest on the Secured Convertible Note into 284,928 shares of our common stock. On July 15, 2014 the conversion price returned to $8.55 per share. The holder of the $2.0 million Secured Convertible Note exercised its right to convert the remaining outstanding principal into 26,263 shares of common stock in two separate tranches on August 28, 2014 and September 19, 2014. In addition, the holder exercised its warrant to purchase 130,000 shares of common stock resulting in cash proceeds of $951,600 during 2014 and utilized the cashless exercise feature for the remaining 6,621 shares.\nOn August 28, 2014, we completed a second private placement to the holder of the $2.0 million Secured Convertible Note and issued the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note, which bore interest at 6% per annum, payable quarterly, and was secured by all assets of the Company. Principal payments were not required until the sixth month after origination and continued ratably for the remaining 18-month term. The principal and interest payments could be made through the payment of cash or in-kind by transferring unrestricted and fully registered shares in an amount equivalent to 80% of the volume weighted average trading price for the 20 consecutive trading days preceding the payment date. The $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note was convertible into shares of common stock at the holder's option at a conversion price of $6.10 per share at any time it was outstanding. In addition, we could force conversion if the market price exceeded $12.20 per share for 20 consecutive trading days. In connection with the second private placement we issued a warrant exercisable to purchase 262,295 shares of common stock at $7.32 per share (the August Warrant\u201d), which was exercisable immediately and expires August 28, 2019.\n 26 \n \nOn December 4, 2014, the holder of the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note converted $36,600 of principal into 6,000 shares of common stock and in February 2015 the holder exercised its conversion rights on the remaining principal and accrued interest balances in exchange for an additional 655,213 shares of common stock. The $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note and August Warrant contained anti-dilution provisions and restricted the incurrence of additional secured indebtedness. We paid a placement agent fee of $240,000 and approximately $101,500 of other third party costs in connection with the transaction, which included legal fees. We used the funds generated by this credit facility to provide the working capital for our operations in 2015.\nIn connection with the anti-dilution provisions of the March 2014 Warrant, the Company was required to increase the number of shares to be issued upon the exercise of the March 2014 Warrant to 136,621 from 100,000 and to reduce the exercise price to $7.32 from $10.00 per share in connection with the August 2014 private placement.\nIn accordance with the terms of the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note we were required to maintain minimum cash balance of not less than $1.5 million until such time as we satisfied all of the Equity Conditions,\u201d as defined in the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note. Such Equity Conditions included our shareholders approving the issuance of shares above the Nasdaq Share Cap. The $1.5 million minimum cash balance was reported as restricted cash separate from cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014. On February 13, 2015, the shareholders approved the issuance of shares above the Nasdaq Share Cap, thereby releasing the restriction on the cash balances.\nBetween February 13 and 25, 2015 the holder of the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note exercised its right to convert the remaining principal on the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note into 655,738 shares of common stock and 5,475 shares for accrued interest at the conversion price of $7.32 per share. In addition, the holder also exercised part of its August Warrant to purchase 212,295 shares of common stock resulting in cash proceeds of $1,553,999 during first quarter 2015. The holder exercised part of its August Warrant to purchase 37,800 shares resulting in cash proceeds of $276,690 during second quarter 2015. Warrants to purchase a total of 12,200 common shares for $7.32 remain outstanding as of December 31, 2015.\nOn July 22, 2015, we closed a $12.0 million offering of our common stock and common stock purchase warrants in an at-the-market registered direct offering and a concurrent private placement of two series of common stock purchase warrants with two investors. At the closing we sold an aggregate of 879,766 shares of our common stock at a per share price of $13.64 in a registered direct offering to the investors. We also issued a registered short-term warrant to the investors exercisable to purchase a total of 437,086 shares of common stock in such offering. Additionally, in a concurrent private placement, we issued to the investors short-term warrants exercisable to purchase a total of 222,738 shares of common stock and long-term warrants exercisable to purchase a total of 879,766 shares of common stock. Both the short-term registered and private placement warrants are immediately exercisable, have an exercise price of $13.43 per share and expire 24 months from the date of issuance. The long-term warrants are immediately exercisable, have an exercise price of $13.43 per share and expire five and one-half years from the date of issuance. After placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses, the net offering proceeds to us totaled approximately $11.2 million prior to any exercise of the warrants. The warrants issued in this transaction did not contain terms that would require us to record derivative warrant liabilities that could affect our financial statements. Proceeds of the offering were used to repay the $2.5 million principal amount of subordinated notes plus accrued interest in full and for working capital purposes.\nAfter completion of the $12.0 million offering on July 22, 2015 and the payment of the $2.5 million principal amount of subordinated notes, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to support our operations for 2016. In addition, if the need arises, we may seek commercial credit facilities including traditional bank borrowings to improve our liquidity position and to finance growth opportunities or future capital needs that may arise.\nWe have warrants outstanding to purchase 1,599,290 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price $13.25 per share outstanding as of December 31, 2015. In addition, there are common stock purchase options outstanding covering 328,690 shares at an average price of $20.43 per share. The exercise of these common stock equivalents would provide us with an additional potential source of liquidity.\nWe had $6,924,079 of available cash and equivalents and net working capital of approximately $18.7 million as of December 31, 2015. Net working capital as of December 31, 2015 includes approximately $3.4 million of accounts receivable and $10.7 million of inventory.\n 27 \n \nCash and cash equivalents balances: As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents with an aggregate balance of $6,924,079, an increase from a balance of $3,049,716 at December 31, 2014. Summarized immediately below and discussed in more detail in the subsequent subsections are the main elements of the $3,874,363 net increase in cash during the year ended December 31, 2015:\n \u25cf Operating activities: $7,686,769 of net cash used in operating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $7,686,769 and $3,172,812 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a deterioration of $4,513,957. The deterioration was primarily the result of our net loss, increases in inventory and decreases in accounts payable offset by increases in deferred revenue and non-cash charges for stock based compensation and fair value changes on debt. Our goal is to increase revenues, return to profitability and decrease our inventory levels during 2016, thereby providing positive cash flows from operations, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in this regard. \u25cf Investing activities: $881,047 of net cash provided by investing activities. Cash provided by investing activities was $881,047 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to cash used in investing activities of $1,348,319 for the year ended December 31, 2014. In connection with the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note issued in August 2014, we were required to maintain a minimum cash balance of not less than $1.5 million until we satisfied all of the Equity Conditions,\u201d as defined in the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note (see Note 7). We satisfied the Equity Conditions\u201d on February 13, 2015, the restriction on the $1.5 million was lifted and the funds became available for working capital needs. In 2015, we replaced and upgraded our internal servers and infrastructure including upgrades to our enterprise software. In 2014 and 2015, we incurred costs for patent applications on our proprietary technology utilized in our new products and included in intangible assets. \u25cf Financing activities: $10,680,085 of net cash provided by financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $10,680,085 and $7,115,869 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. On July 22, 2015 we closed a $12.0 million offering of our common stock and common stock purchase warrants. After placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses, the net offering proceeds to us totaled approximately $11.2 million prior to any exercise of the warrants. Proceeds of the offering were used to repay the $2.5 million principal amount of the subordinated notes. We received $2,133,889 of proceeds in the year ended December 31, 2015 from the exercise of common stock warrants and options. On March 24, 2014, we issued the $2.0 million Secured Convertible Note, the proceeds of which were used for general working capital purposes. On August 25, 2014 we issued the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note. We paid $93,845 and $579,066 of debt issuance costs in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the $2.0 and $4.0 million Secured Convertible Notes. During 2015 we acquired capital equipment financed through capital lease obligations and payments on such obligations represented the cash used in financing activities. \nThe net result of these activities was an increase in cash of $3,874,363 to $6,924,079 for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCommitments:\nWe had $6,924,079 of cash and cash equivalent balances and net positive working capital approximating $18.7 million as of December 31, 2015. Accounts receivable balances represented $3,368,909 of our net working capital at December 31, 2015. We intend to collect our outstanding receivables on a timely basis and reduce the overall level during 2016, which would help to provide positive cash flow to support our operations during 2016. Inventory represented $10,661,766 of our net working capital at December 31, 2015 and finished goods represented $7,895,663 of total inventory. We are actively managing the level of inventory and our goal is to reduce such levels during 2016 by our sales activities, which should provide additional cash flow to help support our operations during 2016.\n 28 \n \nCapital Expenditures. We had no material commitments for capital expenditures at December 31, 2015.\nLease commitments-Operating Leases. We have a long-term operating lease agreement for office and warehouse space that expires in April 2020. We have also entered into month-to-month leases for equipment and facilities. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $401,845 and $398,624, respectively, related to these leases. Following are our minimum lease payments for each year and in total.\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>Year ending December 31: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>439,707 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>445,449 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>451,248 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>457,327 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>154,131 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,974,862 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLicense agreements. We have several license agreements under which we have been assigned the rights to certain licensed materials used in our products. Certain of these agreements require us to pay ongoing royalties based on the number of products shipped containing the licensed material on a quarterly basis. Royalty expense related to these agreements aggregated $26,454 and $27,053 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFollowing is a summary of our licenses as of December 31, 2015:\n License Type Effective Date Expiration Date Terms Production software license agreement April 2005 April 2016 Automatically renews for one-year periods unless terminated by either party. Software sublicense agreement October 2007 October 2016 Automatically renews for one-year periods unless terminated by either party. Media analytics June 2015 May 2016 Either party may unilaterally terminate this agreement by written notice to the other party. \nSupply and distribution agreement.\nWe entered into a supply and distribution agreement with Dragoneye on May 1, 2010 under which it was granted the exclusive world-wide right to sell and distribute a proprietary law enforcement speed measurement device and derivatives to its customers. The term of the agreement was 42 months after the date Dragoneye began full scale production of the product, which commenced in August 2010 and final certification of the product was obtained. The agreement had minimum purchase requirements of 1,000 units per period over three commitment periods. On January 31, 2012, the agreement was amended to reduce the minimum purchase commitment over the second and third years by 52% of the original commitment. We agreed to release our world-wide right to exclusively market the product to the law enforcement community in exchange for the reduction in the purchase commitment.\nThe agreement originally required minimum order quantities that represent a remaining unfulfilled commitment to acquire $634,680 of product as of December 31, 2014. Dragoneye is responsible for all warranty, damage or other claims, losses or liabilities related to the product and is obligated to defend and indemnify us against such risks. We held approximately $1,318,000 of such products in finished goods inventory as of December 31, 2015 and had sold approximately 1,010 units since the beginning of the agreement through December 31, 2015.\nWe filed a lawsuit on June 15, 2013 against Dragoneye for breaching the contract and participated in a mediation of the lawsuit on August 12, 2015 that resulted in a settlement on August 25, 2015. The settlement includes the repair of all LaserAlly units we currently hold and future customer returned units exhibiting the same failure. See Litigation\u201d below for further details.\n 29 \n \nLitigation.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings arising from normal business operations. Although there can be no assurances, based on the information currently available, we believe that it is probable that the ultimate outcome of each of the actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. However, an adverse outcome in certain of the actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the period in which it is recorded.\nOn June 5, 2013, we filed a lawsuit in the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas against Dragoneye. We had entered into a supply and distribution agreement with Dragoneye on May 1, 2010 under which we were granted the right to sell and distribute a proprietary law enforcement speed measurement device and derivatives to our customers under the trade name LaserAlly. The parties amended the agreement on January 31, 2012. In our complaint we alleged that Dragoneye breached the contract because it failed to maintain as confidential information our customer list; it infringed on our trademarks, including LaserAlly and Digital Ally; it tortiously interfered with our existing contracts and business relationships with our dealers, distributors, customers and trading partners; and it engaged in unfair competition and violated the Kansas Uniform Trade Secrets Statutes. We amended the complaint to include claims regarding alleged material defects in the products supplied under the agreement. We participated in a mediation of the lawsuit on August 12, 2015 and agreed to an omnibus resolution of the matter. The settlement included the return of and repair free of charge of all LaserAlly units we held and future customer returned units exhibiting the same or similar failure. Dragoneye was allowed no more than 120 days from October 1, 2015 to repair all units, upgrade all units to current firmware release and to re-certify the units. We will remit the unpaid balance of approximately $191,000 ($91,684.47 remaining at December 31, 2015) currently recorded in accounts payable to Dragoneye in five payments concurrent with the repair and return of units by Dragoneye. Furthermore, all of the remaining minimum contractual purchase requirements were voided. On August 25, 2015, the judge approved the parties' joint stipulation of dismissal with prejudice, which finalized the settlement.\nOn October 25, 2013, we filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas to eliminate threats by a competitor, Utility Associates, Inc. ( Utility\u201d), of alleged patent infringement regarding U.S. Patent No. 6,831,556 (the '556 patent\u201d). Specifically, the lawsuit seeks a declaration that our mobile video surveillance systems do not infringe any claim of the '556 patent. We became aware that Utility had mailed letters to current and prospective purchasers of our mobile video surveillance systems threatening that the use of such systems purchased from third parties not licensed to the '556 patent would create liability for them for patent infringement. We reject Utility's assertion and will vigorously defend the right of end-users to purchase such systems from providers other than Utility. The United States District Court for the District of Kansas dismissed the lawsuit because it decided that Kansas was not the proper jurisdictional forum for the dispute. The District Court's decision was not a ruling on the merits of the case. We appealed the decision and the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court's previous decision.\nIn addition, we began proceedings to invalidate the '556 patent through a request for inter partes review of the '556 patent at the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO\u201d). On July 27, 2015, the USPTO invalidated key claims in Utility's '556 Patent. The Final Decision from the USPTO significantly curtails Utility's ability to threaten law enforcement agencies, municipalities, and others with infringement of the '556 Patent. Utility has appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Briefs have not yet been filed and no schedule for oral argument has been issued. We believe Utility will have a difficult time convincing the appellate court to overturn the decision of the USPTO.\nOn June 4, 2014 we filed an Unfair Competition lawsuit against Utility Associates, Inc. ( Utility\u201d) in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. In the lawsuit we contend that Utility has defamed us and illegally interfered with our contracts, customer relationships and business expectancies by falsely asserting to our customers and others that our products violate the '556 Patent, of which Utility claims to be the holder.\nOur suit also includes claims against Utility for tortious interference with contract and violation of the Kansas Uniform Trade Secrets Act, arising out of Utility's employment of one of our employees, in violation of that employee's Non-Competition and Confidentiality agreements with us. In addition to damages, we are seeking temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief, prohibiting Utility from, among other things, continuing to threaten or otherwise interfere with our customers. On March 4, 2015, an initial hearing was held upon our request for injunctive relief.\n 30 \n \nBased upon facts revealed at the March 4, 2015 hearing, on March 16, 2015, we sought leave to amend our Complaint in the Kansas suit to assert additional claims against Utility. Those new claims include claims of actual or attempted monopolization, in violation of \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act, claims arising under a new Georgia statute that prohibits threats of patent infringement in bad faith,\u201d and additional claims of unfair competition/false advertising in violation of \u00a7 63(a) of the Lanham Act. As these statutes expressly provide, we are seeking treble damages, punitive damages and attorneys' fees, as well as injunctive relief. The Court concluded its hearing on April 22, 2015, and allowed us leave to amend our complaint, but denied our preliminary injunction. The case is now in the discovery stage. However, we believe that the USPTO's final decision issued on July 27, 2015 will provide us with substantial basis to pursue our claims either through court trial or by summary judgment motions. We intend to pursue recovery from Utility, its insurers and other parties, as appropriate.\nOn June 13, 2014, Utility filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against us alleging infringement of the '556 patent. The suit was served on us on June 20, 2014. As alleged in our first filed lawsuit described above, we believe the '556 patent is both invalid and not infringed. Further, the USPTO issued its final decision invalidating 23 of the 25 claims asserted in the '556 Patent, as noted above. We believe that the suit filed by Utility is without merit and we will vigorously defend the claims asserted against us. An adverse resolution of the foregoing litigation or patent proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The Court stayed all proceedings with respect to this lawsuit pending the outcome of the patent review performed by the USPTO and the appellate court. Based on the USPTO's final decision to invalidate substantially all claims contained in the '556 patent, we intend to file for summary judgment in our favor if Utility does not request outright dismissal.\nThe Company received notice in April 2015 that TASER International, Inc. ( Taser\u201d), one of our competitors, had commenced an action in the USPTO for a re-examination of our U.S. Patent No. 8,781,292 ( the '292 Patent). A re-examination is essentially a request that the USPTO review whether the patent should have issued in its present form in view of the prior art,\u201d e.g., other patents in the same technology field. The prior art used by Taser to request the re-examination is a patent application (which never issued into a patent) assigned to an unrelated third party and was not the result of any of Taser's own research and development efforts.\nOur '292 Patent is directed to a system that determines when a recording device, such as a law enforcement officer's body camera or in-car video recorder, begins recording and automatically instructs other recording devices to begin recording. The technology described in the '292 Patent is incorporated in our VuLink product.\nOn August 17, 2015 the USPTO issued a first, non-final action rejecting all 20 claims of the '292 Patent respecting our'292 Patent, which was undergoing an ex parte re-examination. We were provided the opportunity to discuss the merits of the prior art and the scope of the patent claims with the patent Examiner handling the reexamination and to amend the patent claims. On January 14, 2016 the USPTO ultimately rejected Taser's efforts and confirmed the validity of the '292 patent with 59 claims covering various aspects of our auto-activation technology. On February 2, 2016 the USPTO issued another patent relating our auto-activation technology for law enforcement cameras. U.S. Patent No. 9,253,452 ( the '452 patent\u201d) generally covers the automatic activation and coordination of multiple recording devices in response to a triggering event such as a law enforcement officer activating the light bar on the vehicle.\nThe Company filed suit on January 15, 2016 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas (Case No: 2:16-cv-02032) against Taser, alleging that Taser willfully infringed the '292 Patent by selling and offering to sell its Axon camera product line and Signal Performance Power Magazine. The lawsuit was initiated after the USPTO reconfirmed the validity of the '292 patent. On February 2, 2016, we amended our complaint against Taser, further alleging that Taser is directly and indirectly liable for infringing the '452 Patent. Our amended complaint seeks both monetary damages and a permanent injunction against Taser for infringing both the '452 and '292 Patents.\nIn addition to the '452 Patent infringement claims, the February 2, 2016 amended complaint added a new set of claims to the lawsuit alleging that Taser conspired to keep us out of the marketplace by engaging in improper, unethical, and unfair competition. The amended lawsuit alleges Taser bribed officials and otherwise conspired to secure no-bid contracts for its products in violation of both state law and federal antitrust law. Our lawsuit also seeks monetary and injunctive relief, including treble damages, for these alleged violations.\nOn February 19, 2016 TASER asked for and was granted an extension of time to answer or otherwise plead to the complaint alleging willful patent infringement, the bribery of officials and otherwise conspired to secure no-bid contracts for its products in violation of both state law and federal antitrust law. On March 4, 2016, TASER filed a motion to dismiss our complaint which is now pending before the court.\n 31 \n \nOn or about May 22, 2014, Stephen Gans, a former director and former principal shareholder of us, filed a complaint in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada that asserts claims against us and Stanton E. Ross, Leroy C. Richie, Daniel F. Hutchins and Elliot M. Kaplan (the Defendant Directors\u201d), who are members of its Board of Directors. We were served with the complaint on May 28, 2014. Among other things, the complaint alleged (i) that the Defendant Directors breached their fiduciary duties by failing to consider a financing proposal offered by Mr. Gans and his affiliates; and (ii) that the Defendant Directors, acting at the direction of Stanton E. Ross, did not independently and objectively evaluate Mr. Gans' protestations about certain alleged transactions between us and Infinity Energy Resources, Inc., and by so doing, breached their fiduciary duties. We and the Defendant Directors vigorously defended the claims asserted against us and them. We and the Defendant Directors filed a response denying all of the plaintiff's allegations and have asserted counter-claims that allege that Gans committed improper acts that included: (a) failing to disclose the nature and substance of an SEC investigation of Gans; (b) engaging in potential insider trading; (c) misappropriating our confidential information; (d) attempting to use his position as a director to personally enrich himself; and (e) making unauthorized, misleading, and factually inaccurate filings to the SEC about us.\nOn December 11, 2014, the parties agreed in principle to compromise and dismiss with prejudice substantially all of their claims. Within the scope of that settlement are each of the shareholder derivative claims\u201d that Gans had asserted against us and the Defendant Directors. The settlement to which the parties agreed resulted in no monetary recovery by any party. On April 7, 2015 the Court approved the settlement of all shareholder derivative claims.\nWe are also involved as a plaintiff and defendant in ordinary, routine litigation and administrative proceedings incidental to its business from time to time, including customer collections, vendor and employment-related matters. We believe that the likely outcome of any other pending cases and proceedings will not be material to our business or financial condition.\nSponsorship. On April 16, 2015 we entered into a Title Sponsorship Agreement under which we became the title sponsor for a Web.com Tour golf tournament (the Tournament\u201d) held annually in the Kansas City Metropolitan area. Such Agreement provides us with naming rights and other benefits for the 2015 through 2019 annual Tournament in exchange for the following sponsorship fee:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>Year </td> <td> </td> <td>Sponsorship fee </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>375,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>475,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>475,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have the right to sell and retain the proceeds from the sale of additional sponsorships, including but not limited to a presenting sponsorship, a concert sponsorship and founding partnerships for the Tournament. We recorded a net sponsorship expense of $173,335 relating to the 2015 Tournament during the year ended December 31, 2015. Such expense was included in sales and promotional expense in the accompanying statement of operations.\nStock Repurchase Program. On August 25, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $2.5 million of the Company's common stock in the open market, or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchases, if and when made, will be subject to market conditions, applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other factors. The repurchase program will be funded using a portion of cash and cash equivalents, along with cash flow from operations. Purchases may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time. We have not repurchased any shares under this program as of December 31, 2015.\n(k) Plan. We sponsor a 401(k) retirement savings plan for the benefit of our employees. The plan, as amended, requires us to provide 100% matching contributions for employees, who elect to contribute up to 3% of their compensation to the plan and 50% matching contributions for employee's elective deferrals on the next 2% of their contributions. We made matching contributions totaling $163,227 and $156,071 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Each participant is 100% vested at all times in employee and employer matching contributions.\n 32 \n \nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1, Financial Statements\u201d, of this report. While the selection and application of any accounting policy may involve some level of subjective judgments and estimates, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to our financial statements, potentially involve the most subjective judgments in their selection and application, and are the most susceptible to uncertainties and changing conditions:\n \u25cf Revenue Recognition / Allowance for Doubtful Accounts; \u25cf Allowance for Excess and Obsolete Inventory; \u25cf Warranty Reserves; \u25cf Stock-based Compensation Expense; and \u25cf Accounting for Income Taxes; and \u25cf Determination of Fair Value Calculation for Financial Instruments and Derivatives. \nRevenue Recognition / Allowances for Doubtful Accounts. Revenue is recognized for the shipment of products or delivery of service when all four of the following conditions are met:\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(i) </td> <td>Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>(ii) </td> <td>Delivery has occurred; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>(iii) </td> <td>The price is fixed or determinable; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>(iv) </td> <td>Collectability is reasonably assured. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe review all significant, unusual or nonstandard shipments of product or delivery of services as a routine part of our accounting and financial reporting process to determine compliance with these requirements. Extended warranties are offered on selected products and when a customer purchases an extended warranty the associated proceeds are treated as deferred revenue and recognized over the term of the extended warranty.\nOur principal customers are state, local and federal law enforcement agencies, which historically have been low risks for uncollectible accounts. We also have commercial customers and international distributors who may present a greater risk for uncollectible accounts than such law enforcement customers and we consider a specific reserve for bad debts based on their individual circumstances. Our historical bad debts have been negligible, with less than $195,000 charged off as uncollectible on cumulative revenues of $185.8 million since we commenced deliveries during 2006. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had provided a reserve for doubtful accounts of $74,997 and $65,977, respectively.\nWe periodically perform a specific review of significant individual receivables outstanding for risk of loss due to uncollectibility. Based on such review, we consider our reserve for doubtful accounts to be adequate as of December 31, 2015. However, if the balance due from any significant customer ultimately becomes uncollectible, then our allowance for bad debts will not be sufficient to cover the charge-off and we will be required to record additional bad debt expense in our statement of operations.\nAllowance for Excess and Obsolete Inventory. We record valuation reserves on our inventory for estimated excess or obsolete inventory items. The amount of the reserve is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. On a quarterly basis, management performs an analysis of the underlying inventory to identify reserves needed for excess and obsolescence. We use our best judgment to estimate appropriate reserves based on this analysis. In addition, we adjust the carrying value of inventory if the current market value of that inventory is below its cost.\nInventories consisted of the following at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Raw material and component parts </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,833,873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,987,124 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Work-in-process </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134,641 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>280,429 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Finished goods </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,895,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,576,480 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Subtotal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,864,177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,844,033 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Reserve for excess and obsolete inventory </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,202,411 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(600,578 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,661,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,243,455 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 33 \n \nWe balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to our customers against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to changing technology and customer requirements. As reflected above, our inventory reserves represented 10.1% of the gross inventory balance at December 31, 2015, compared to 6.1% of the gross inventory balance at December 31, 2014. We had $1,202,411 and $600,578 in reserves for obsolete and excess inventories at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Total raw materials and component parts were $3,833,873 and $2,987,124 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, an increase of $846,749 (28%). The increase in raw materials and component parts is primarily attributable to increased forecasts of sales for the FirstVU HD and the need to secure long lead component inventory items in advance of production. Finished goods balances were $7,895,663 and $6,576,480 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, an increase of $1,319,183 (20%). The increase in finished goods was primarily in DVM-750 products and additional cameras for our various products. Finished goods at December 31, 2015 consist primarily of the Laser Ally products, normal levels of our DVM-500 Plus product and the increased DVM-750 product inventories in anticipation of the closing of several significant international contracts. The increase in the inventory reserve is primarily due to the change in sales mix of our products which has resulted in a higher level of excess component parts of the older versions of our legacy products. We believe the reserves are appropriate given our inventory levels at December 31, 2015.\nIf actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or significant engineering changes to our products that are not anticipated and appropriately managed, additional inventory write-downs may be required in excess of the inventory reserves already established.\nWarranty Reserves. We generally provide up to a two-year parts and labor warranty on our products to our customers. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims. We actively study trends of claims and take action to improve product quality and minimize claims. Our warranty reserves were decreased to $159,838 as of December 31, 2015 compared to $247,082 as of December 31, 2014. We have limited experience with the FirstVU HD and DVM-800 and will monitor our reserve for all warranty claims related to these two newer products. There is a risk that we will have higher warranty claim frequency rates and average cost of claims than our history has indicated on our legacy mirror products on our new products for which we have limited experience. Actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods.\nStock-based Compensation Expense. We grant stock options to our employees and directors and such benefits provided are share-based payment awards which require us to make significant estimates related to determining the value of our share-based compensation. In 2015, we issued no stock options as we continued our trend of issuing restricted common shares subject to vesting requirements. As such, stock based compensation is now based upon the grant date market value of the restricted shares which is an objective measure.\nAccounting for Income Taxes. Accounting for income taxes requires significant estimates and judgments on the part of management. Such estimates and judgments include, but are not limited to, the effective tax rate anticipated to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future, the sufficiency of taxable income in future periods to realize the benefits of net deferred tax assets and net operating losses currently recorded and the likelihood that tax positions taken in tax returns will be sustained on audit.\nAs required by authoritative guidance, we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Authoritative guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2014, cumulative valuation allowances in the amount of $12,692,000 were recorded in connection with the net deferred income tax assets. Based on a review of our deferred tax assets and recent operating performance, we determined that our valuation allowance should be increased to $18,105,000 to fully reserve our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2015. We determined that it was appropriate to continue to provide a full valuation reserve on our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 because of the overall net operating loss carryforwards available. We expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets. To the extent we determine that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not based upon expected future taxable income, a portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed. Such a reversal would be recorded as an income tax benefit and, for some portion related to deductions for stock option exercises, an increase in shareholders' equity.\n 34 \n \nAs required by authoritative guidance, we have performed a comprehensive review of our portfolio of uncertain tax positions in accordance with recognition standards established by the FASB, an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return, that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. We have no recorded liability as of December 31, 2015 representing uncertain tax positions.\nWe have generated substantial deferred income tax assets related to our operations primarily from the charge to compensation expense taken for stock options, certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards. For us to realize the income tax benefit of these assets, we must generate sufficient taxable income in future periods when such deductions are allowed for income tax purposes. In some cases where deferred taxes were the result of compensation expense recognized on stock options, our ability to realize the income tax benefit of these assets is also dependent on our share price increasing to a point where these options have intrinsic value at least equal to the grant date fair value and are exercised. In assessing whether a valuation allowance is needed in connection with our deferred income tax assets, we have evaluated our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to utilize the benefit of the deferred income tax assets. We continue to evaluate our ability to use recorded deferred income tax asset balances. If we fail to generate taxable income for financial reporting in future years, no additional tax benefit would be recognized for those losses, since we will not have accumulated enough positive evidence to support our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards in the future. Therefore, we may be required to increase our valuation allowance in future periods should our assumptions regarding the generation of future taxable income not be realized.\nDetermination of Fair Value for Financial Instruments and Derivatives. During 2014 in two separate transactions we issued a total of $6.0 million of Secured Convertible Notes with detachable warrants to purchase common stock. We elected to record the Secured Convertible Notes on their fair value basis. In addition, the warrants to purchase common stock contained anti-dilution provisions that required them to be accounted for as derivative liabilities. We were required to determine the fair value of these financial instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 for financial reporting purposes. The entire principal balance of the Secured Convertible Notes had been converted and all warrants had been exercised, except for warrants to acquire 12,200 common shares at $7.32 per share, as of December 31, 2015.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820\u201d), we utilize the market approach to measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, liabilities or a group of assets or liabilities, such as a business.\nASC 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:\n \u25cf Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities \u25cf Level 2 - Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities) \u25cf Level 3 - Significant unobservable inputs (including the Company's own assumptions in determining the fair value) \n 35 \n \nThe following table represents our hierarchy for our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Level 1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Level 2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Level 3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Warrant derivative liability </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,053 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,053 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,053 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,053 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInflation and Seasonality\nInflation has not materially affected us during the past fiscal year. We do not believe that our business is seasonal in nature; however, we generally generate higher revenues during the second half of the calendar year compared to the first half.", "item_7_text": "Item 7.

We have the ability to integrate electronic, radio, computer, mechanical, and multi-media technologies to create unique solutions to our customers' requests. We began shipping our flagship digital video mirror product in March 2006. We have developed additional products to complement our DVM-500 and DVM-750, our original in-car digital video products, including lower priced in-car digital video mirrors (the DVM-100, DVM-400, DVM-800 and MicroVU HD), and body worn camera (FirstVU HD) products designed for law enforcement usage. Since 2011 we have launched the following new products: the FirstVU HD; DVM-800; the MicroVU HD; the patented VuLink product which integrates our body-worn cameras with our in-car systems by providing hands-free automatic activation; and the new line of digital video mirrors (the DVM-250 and DVM-250 Plus) that serve as event recorders\u201d for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets in order to expand our customer base beyond the traditional law enforcement agencies. We have additional research and development projects that we anticipate will result in several new product launches in 2016. We believe that the launch of these new products will help to diversify and broaden the market for our product offerings.\n 16 \n \nWe experienced operating losses for all of the quarters during 2015 and 2014. The following is a summary of our recent operating results on a quarterly basis:\n\nOur business is subject to substantial fluctuations on a quarterly basis as reflected in the significant variations in revenues and operating results in the above table. These variations result from the timing of large individual orders and the traction gained by our new products, such as the FirstVU HD, MicroVU HD, FleetVU and DVM-800. We reported an operating loss of $2,700,529 on revenues of $5,051,119 for fourth quarter 2015 compared to an operating loss of $2,140,785 on revenues of $5,096,088 for third quarter 2015, an operating loss of $816,962 on revenues of $5,634,237 for second quarter 2015, and an operating loss of $1,963,195 on revenues of $4,248,764 for first quarter 2015. Our fourth quarter 2015 revenues decreased slightly from third quarter 2015. Our gross margin percentage decreased to 31.0% in the fourth quarter from 40.0% in the third quarter 2015 and 54.9% in the second quarter 2015. During the third quarter 2015, we decided to upgrade the connectors contained in the camera cable assembly on our FirstVU HD product to improve functionality and reliability. This upgrade was applied to all deployed units in the field as well as in our inventory, which required us to rework the camera assemblies and scrap a portion of the original cable assembly. Total scrap costs recognized in third and fourth quarter 2015 approximated $1,615,000, which adversely affected our gross margins and other operating results. Management believes the FirstVU HD connector upgrade implemented to all deployed units during the third and fourth quarter 2015 will resolve the cable assembly issue and that gross margins should return to more normal levels in future quarters. Our selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses were higher in the fourth quarter 2015 compared to the first three quarters of 2015. The primary reason for the increased SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter 2015 over the three prior quarters of 2015 was the addition of technical support staff to handle field inquiries and installation matters because our installed customer base has expanded and additional technical support staff required for our new products, such as the FirstVU HD and DVM-800. Many of our customers require extensive information technology infrastructure planning to manage and store the audio/video evidence gathered by our systems, which often requires new and larger data servers. Our international revenues during 2015 decreased to $148,667 from $961,763 in 2014.\n 17 \n \nThere have been a number of factors and trends affecting our recent performance, which include:\n \u25cf Revenues decreased in fourth quarter 2015 to $5,051,119 from $5,096,088 in third quarter 2015 and $5,634,237 in second quarter 2015. We believe the decline in revenues in the fourth quarter 2015 and third quarter 2015 was attributable to a competitor, TASER International, Inc. ( Taser\u201d) stating in one of its press releases that all the claims in one of our patents were determined to be unpatentable.\u201d We believe its press release was misleading and incorrect, causing confusion and concern in our marketplace, customer base and potential customers. Taser commenced an action in the United States Patent & Trademark Office ( USPTO\u201d) for a reexamination of our U.S. Patent No. 8,781,292 (the '292 Patent\u201d). A reexamination is essentially a request that the USPTO review whether the patent should have issued in its present form in view of the prior art,\u201d e.g., other patents in the same technology field. The '292 Patent relates to the \u2018automatic trigger\u201d that allows our body camera and our in-car system to automatically begin recording without the need for law enforcement officers to manually turn them on. The automatic trigger covered by our '292 Patent is incorporated in our VuLink product. Such product has been popular and consequently the confusion and misinformation caused by our competitor has impacted our revenues of our VuLink product and body-worn and in-car systems. Ultimately, the USPTO rejected Taser's efforts and reconfirmed the validity of the '292 patent on January 16, 2016 and we have filed suit alleging willful patent infringement against Taser and included claims of commercial bribery and other unfair trade practices. See Litigation for details. \u25cf Recognizing a critical limitation in law enforcement camera technology, during 2014 we pioneered the development of our VuLink ecosystem that provided intuitive auto-activation functionality as well as coordination between multiple recording devices. The USPTO has recognized these pioneering efforts by granting us multiple patents with claims covering numerous features, such as automatically activating an officer's cameras when the light bar is activated or a data-recording device such as a smart weapon is activated. Additionally, Digital Ally's patent claims cover automatic coordination between multiple recording devices. Prior to this work, officers were forced to manually activate each device while responding to emergency scenarios - a requirement that both decreased the usefulness of the existing camera systems and diverted officers' attention during critical moments. We are seeing a trend in which law enforcement agencies have recognized the value of our VuLink technology and are seeking information on auto-activation\u201d features in requests for bids and requests for information involving the procurement process of body-worn cameras and in-car systems. We believe this trend may result in our patented VuLink technology becoming the de-facto standard\u201d for agencies engaged in deploying state-of-the-art body-worn and in-car camera systems. We expect that this technology will have a significant impact on our revenues in the long-term particularly if we are successful in our prosecution of the patent infringement litigation currently pending with Taser. \u25cf We believe recently highly publicized law enforcement incidents have provided federal, state and municipal governments with an opportunity to reassess spending priorities, moving from the militarization of the police to increasing transparency and accountability. This underlying shift in priorities has redirected and increased law enforcement budgets and funding to our products and offerings. We are hopeful this trend continues into 2016 and beyond. In that regard, our FirstVU body-worn camera revenues increased to 20% of total 2015 revenues from 11% of revenues in 2014. \u25cf We have launched additional products to complement our legacy in-car video products for law enforcement agencies in an effort to diversify our sources of revenue to new market channels. In that regard, we have expanded our product offerings to include incident recorders designed to meet commercial fleet owners' needs. We believe these commercial fleet offerings will be appealing to prospective customers who want to monitor, manage and train their drivers and to provide liability protection. Such fleet customers may include ambulance service providers, taxicab fleets, limousine services, off-premises airport parking services, over the road trucks and others who maintain a fleet of vehicles. We expect that our commercial fleet business will be a significant growth provider for us in the future. Revenues derived from our commercial business reached to 10% of total revenues in 2015 compared to 5% for 2014. \u25cf Our gross margin percentage decreased to 31.0% in the fourth quarter 2015 from 40.0% in the third quarter, 54.9% in the second quarter and 38.9% in the first quarter of 2015. Our gross margin decline is primarily attributable to the camera cable connector upgrade implemented in the third and fourth quarter 2015 to our FirstVU HD product that caused us to rework our entire installed base of FirstVU HD's and scrap a portion of the original cable assembly. This upgrade contributed to total scrap costs approximating $1,615,000 that adversely affected our fourth and third quarter 2015 gross margins. Management believes the FirstVU HD connector upgrade implemented to all deployed units during the third quarter and fourth quarter 2015 will resolve the cable assembly issue and that gross margins should return to more normal levels in future quarters. \u25cf Our international revenues were less than expected for the year ends December 31, 2015 and 2014, with total international revenues of $148,667 (1% of total revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $961,763 (6% of total revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014. Unfavorable changes in the foreign exchange rate in many countries have impacted our international sales. We were disappointed in our international revenues given the high level of bidding activity. We provided bids to a number of international customers; however, international sale cycles generally take longer than domestic business. We are hopeful that our new products will appeal to international customers, in particular the DVM-800 and FirstVU HD, although we can make no assurances in this regard. \n 18 \n \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations) or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have material current or future effect on financial conditions, changes in the financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or significant components of revenue or expenses.\nWe are a party to operating leases, title sponsorship, and license agreements that represent commitments for future payments (described in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements) and we have issued purchase orders in the ordinary course of business that represent commitments to future payments for goods and services.\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nResults of Operations\nSummarized immediately below and discussed in more detail in the subsequent sub-sections is an analysis of our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, represented as a percentage of total revenues for each respective year:\n\n 19 \n \nRevenues\nOur current product offerings include the following:\n\nWe sell our products and services to law enforcement and commercial customers in the following manner:\n \u25cf Sales to domestic customers are made directly to the end customer (typically a law enforcement agency or a commercial customer) through our direct sales force, comprised of our employees. Revenue is recorded when the product is shipped to the end customer. \u25cf Sales to international customers are made through independent distributors who purchase products from us at a wholesale price and sell to the end user (typically law enforcement agencies or a commercial customer) at a retail price. The distributor retains the margin as its compensation for its role in the transaction. The distributor generally maintains product inventory, customer receivables and all related risks and rewards of ownership. Revenue is recorded when the product is shipped to the distributor consistent with the terms of the distribution agreement. \u25cf Repair parts and services for domestic and international customers are generally handled by our inside customer service employees. Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the repair parts and acceptance of the service or materials by the end customer. \nWe may discount our prices on specific orders when considering the size of the order, the specific customer and the competitive landscape. We believe that our systems are cost competitive compared to our principal competitors and generally are lower priced when considering comparable features and capabilities.\n 20 \n \nRevenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were derived from the following sources:\n\nWe experienced a change in the sales mix of our products for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Our newer products, the DVM-800 and the FirstVU HD, contributed 56% of total sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, compared to 51% for the comparable period ending December 31, 2014. We expect the sales mix will continue to transition from our legacy M-500 Plus and DVM -750 product lines to the newer products during 2016. In addition, our commercial event recorders increased from 5% to 10% of total revenues. We expect this trend to continue because of the appeal of our new FleetVU driver management and monitoring tool.\nRevenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $20,030,208 and $17,444,419, respectively, an increase of $2,585,789 (15%), due to the following factors:\n \u25cf Our revenues increased significantly for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 (15%). We believe the improvement is attributable to the increased attention to the benefits of video evidence caused by the civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri and other cities in the United States and the features of our newer products. We have had a large increase in inquiries, test and evaluation units for our FirstVU and DVM-800 products in our pilot programs for prospective clients since the events in Ferguson, Missouri and elsewhere and are hopeful these will culminate in sales as the potential customers evaluate our body-worn and in-car video camera solutions. We believe that there has been a shift in buying patterns of our customers to emphasize our products because of the transparency and accountability they provide to the general public. \u25cf We shipped twenty-two individual orders in excess of $100,000, for a total of approximately $3,727,000 in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to six individual orders in excess of $100,000, for a total of approximately $2,500,000 in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. Eight of the large orders were for a package including our in-car video system, our FirstVU body worn camera and our patented VULink connectivity system. Additionally, six of the large orders were for our commercial event recorders and most of those orders included our FleetVu driver management and monitoring tool. Our average order size increased to approximately $3,060 in the year ended December 31, 2015 from $2,615 during the year ended September 30, 2014. \u25cf The DVM-800 and FirstVU HD, introduced in 2013, contributed 56% of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 51% for the comparable period ending December 31, 2014. We expect the sales mix will continue to migrate from the DVM 500-Plus and DVM-750 product lines to the newer products in 2016. \u25cf Our international revenues decreased to $148,667, representing 1% of total revenues, during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $961,763, representing 6% of total revenues, during the year ended December 31, 2014. Our international revenues during 2015 were negatively impacted by the unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates for our international customers. In particular the Mexican peso exchange rate deterioration has delayed purchases by several of our largest customers and opportunities. We were disappointed in our international revenues given the high level of bidding activity. We have provided bids to a number of international customers; however, international sale cycles generally take longer than domestic business. We also believe that our new products may appeal to international customers, in particular the DVM-800 and FirstVU HD, although we can make no assurances in this regard. \n 21 \n \nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue on units sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $11,680,853 and $7,521,626, respectively, an increase of $4,159,227 (55%). The increase in cost of goods sold is partially due to the 15% increase in revenues. In addition, we encountered printed circuit board issues in our FirstVU HD body-worn cameras early in 2015 and in response upgraded the entire installed base of FirstVUs in the third and fourth quarter 2015. The upgrade involved the replacement of a connector contained in the camera cable assembly on our FirstVU HD product that dramatically increased rework and scrap rates on our FirstVU HD. Our scrap costs were approximately $1,615,000 for third and fourth quarter 2015. We also increased our inventory reserve in 2015 due to changes in the sales mix to the DVM-800 platform, which has resulted in a higher level of excess component parts of older versions of our legacy products. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased to 58% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 43% for the year ended December 31, 2014. We believe that the FirstVU HD connector upgrade implemented to all deployed units during the third and fourth quarter 2015 will resolve the cable assembly issue and that gross margins should return to more normal levels in 2016. Our goal is to maintain cost of sales as a percentage of revenues at 40% or less during 2016. We expect that our newer product offerings, in particular the DVM-800, VuLink and FirstVU HD, should improve our cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales in the longer term. We do not expect to incur significant capital expenditures to ramp up production of our current products because our internal process is largely assembling subcomponents, testing and shipping of completed products or we use contract manufacturers. We rely on our subcontractors to produce finished circuit boards that represent the primary components of our products, thereby reducing our need to purchase capital equipment.\nWe had $1,202,411 and $600,578 in reserves for obsolete and excess inventories at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Total raw materials and component parts were $3,833,873 and $2,987,124 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, an increase of $846,749 (28%). The increase in raw materials and component parts is primarily attributable to our forecasts of sales for the FirstVU HD, and VuLink and the need to secure long lead component inventory items in advance of production. Finished goods balances were $7,895,663 and $6,576,480 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, an increase of $1,319,183 (20%). The increase in finished goods was primarily for the DVM-750 product for anticipated international customer orders and additional cameras for our various products. Finished goods at December 31, 2015 consist primarily of the Laser Ally products and our DVM-500 Plus and DVM-750 products for expected orders. The increase in the inventory reserve is primarily due to the change in sales mix of our products which has resulted in a higher level of excess component parts of the older versions of our legacy products. We believe the reserves are appropriate given our inventory levels at December 31, 2015.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $8,349,355 and $9,922,793, respectively, a decrease of $1,573,438 (16%). The decrease is a result of the cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increasing to 58% during the year ended December 31, 2015 from 43% for the year ended December 31, 2014 offset by the 15% increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our goal is to improve our margins to 60% over the longer term based on the expected margins of our newer products, in particular the DVM-800 and FirstVU HD, as they continue to gain traction in the marketplace and we increase commercial production in 2016. In addition, as revenues increase from these products, we will seek to further improve our margins from them through economies of scale and more efficiently utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components. We plan to continue our initiative on more efficient management of our supply chain through outsourcing production, quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices.\n 22 \n \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $15,970,826 and $12,811,987 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $3,158,839 (25%). Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 80% in 2015 from 74% in 2014. The significant components of selling, general and administrative expenses are as follows:\nThe significant components of selling, general and administrative expenses are as follows:\n\nResearch and development expense. We continue to focus on bringing new products to market, including updates and improvements to current products. Our research and development expenses totaled $2,980,807 and $2,905,407 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $75,400 (3%). We employed a total of 25 engineers at December 31, 2015 compared to 22 engineers at December 31, 2014, most of whom are dedicated to research and development activities for new products. We are increasing our engineering staff of web-based developers as we expand our offerings to include cloud-based evidence storage and management for our law enforcement customers (VuVault.net) and our web-based commercial fleet driver monitoring and management tool (FleetVU). Research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 15% in 2015 compared to 17% in 2014. We have active research and development projects on several new products, as well as upgrades to our existing product lines. We consider our research and development capabilities and new product focus to be a competitive advantage and will continue to invest in this area on a prudent basis.\nSelling, advertising and promotional expenses. Selling, advertising and promotional expense totaled $3,965,400 and $3,340,764 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $624,636 (19%). Salaries and commissions to our sales personnel represent the primary components of these costs and were $3,116,729 and $2,729,589 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $387,140 (14%), which is commensurate with our 15% increase in revenues. The effective commission rate was 15.6% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nPromotional and advertising expenses totaled $848,671 during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $611,175 during the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $237,496 (39%). The increase is primarily attributable to the Company becoming the title sponsor of the Web.com Tour golf tournament held annually in the Kansas City Metropolitan area. Our net promotional expense related to sponsorship of the 2015 tournament totaled $172,623. Additionally, we had increased participation in trade shows and media advertising in trade publications and other marketing initiatives designed to help penetrate commercial markets for our DVM-250 Plus event recorders, and to increase awareness of our FirstVU HD, MicroVu HD, VuLink and the DVM-800 within our law enforcement channel during 2015.\nStock-based compensation expense. Stock based compensation expense totaled $1,623,033 and $834,593 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $788,440 (94%). The increase is primarily due to the amortization of the restricted stock granted during 2015 to our officers, directors, and other employees that had the effect of increasing the stock compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. The total number of restricted shares granted and our market stock price was higher on the specific dates of the 2015 stock grants compared to previous years, which increased the grant date fair value attributable to the restricted stock grants.\nThe total number of restricted shares granted to the Board of Directors, officers and employees increased to 326,500 shares during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 192,500 shares during the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, the weighted average grant date price of the shares increased to $8.42 per share compared to $5.33 per share during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nProfessional fees and expense. Professional fees and expenses totaled $1,368,758 and $1,153,985 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $214,773 (19%). Professional fees during 2014 and 2015 were related primarily to normal public company matters, intellectual property matters and litigation matters. The increase in professional fees and expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to higher accounting fees and litigation expenses related to the Utility and Taser matters. See Litigation for further discussion.\n 23 \n \nExecutive, sales and administrative staff payroll. Executive, sales and administrative staff payroll expenses totaled $2,941,151 and $2,012,552 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $928,599 (46%). This increase is primarily attributable to the hiring of additional technical support staff to handle field inquiries and installation matters because our installed customer base has expanded and the need for additional technical support staff for our new products, such as the DVM-800, FirstVU HD, VuVault.com and FleetVU. In addition, the Company established a bonus plan during 2015, which resulted in approximately $260,000 in compensation expense and the Company incurred an increase of approximately $250,000 in employee-based retention expenses.\nOther. Other selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $3,091,677 and $2,564,686 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $526,991 (21%). The increase in other expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to increased consulting, contract labor and insurance expenses. We are utilizing consultants to help develop engineering and manufacturing standard processes with a goal of achieving ISO 13485, ISO 9001, FDA cGMPs, and MD Directive 93/42/EEC certifications. We also utilized consultants to help design, develop and launch a new corporate website in 2015.\nOperating Loss\nFor the reasons previously stated, our operating loss was $7,621,471 and $2,889,194 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a deterioration of $4,732,277 (164%). Operating loss as a percentage of revenues increased to 38% in 2015 from 17% in 2014.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased to $21,156 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $13,660 in 2014. The increase is attributable to an increase in average cash and cash equivalents balances related to our $12.0 million registered direct offering which was completed in July 2015.\nChange in Warrant Derivative Liabilities\nDetachable warrants to purchase a total of 398,916 common shares, as adjusted, were issued in conjunction with the Secured Convertible Notes ( Secured Convertible Notes\u201d) during March and August 2014. The warrants were required to be treated as derivative liabilities because of their anti-dilution and down-round provisions. Accordingly, we estimated the fair value of such warrants as of their respective date of issuance and record a corresponding derivative liability in the balance sheet. Upon exercise of the warrants we recognized a gain/loss based on the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise. In addition, the warrant derivative liability is adjusted to the estimated fair value of any unexercised warrants as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nThe holder of the Secured Convertible Notes exercised a portion of such warrants in August 2014 and in September 2014 with the change in value of the warrant derivative totaling $3,233,068 being recognized as a non-cash charge to operations during the year ended December 31, 2014 representing the increase in our stock price over the exercise price at the respective exercise dates. The changes in the fair value of the warrant derivatives related to unexercised warrants totaled $1,193,694 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in warrant derivative liabilities totaled $4,426,762 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the warrant derivative liability balance was $2,186,214 as of December 31, 2014.\nThe holder of the Secured Convertible Notes exercised a portion of its warrants in March 2015 and April 2015 with the change in value of the warrant derivative through the date of exercise resulting in a gain of $336,373 compared to the estimated warrant derivative liability balance. The resulting derivative balance of $1,748,155 was offset against the warrant derivative liability during the year ended December 31, 2015. The changes in the fair value of the warrant derivatives related to unexercised warrants resulted in a gain of $34,633 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The change in warrant derivative liabilities resulted in a gain of $371,006 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the warrant derivative liability balance was $67,053 as of December 31, 2015.\n 24 \n \nChange in Fair Value of Secured Convertible Notes Payable\nWe elected to account for and record the Secured Convertible Notes on their fair value basis. The holder of the Secured Convertible Notes exercised its right to convert such notes to 316,716 common shares during July 2014 through September 2014. The change in fair market value of the Secured Convertible Notes associated with the conversion of debt was $384,614 during the year ended December 31, 2014, representing the increase in our stock price over the conversion price as of the respective conversion dates. On December 4, 2014, the holder of the Secured Convertible Note exercised its right to convert $36,600 principal amount into 6,000 shares of our common stock at the conversion price of $6.10 per share. The increase in fair market value of these 6,000 shares over the $36,600 principal retired was $89,400, representing the increase in our stock price over the conversion price as of the conversion date. As of December 31, 2014 the fair market value of the remaining Secured Convertible Note was $3,273,431 representing a change in fair market value for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaling $302,552. Accordingly, the total change in fair value of the two Secured Convertible Notes payable was $776,566 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe holder of the Secured Convertible Notes exercised its right to convert the remaining principal balance of such Notes into 655,738 shares of common stock and 5,475 shares for accrued interest thereon at a conversion price of $7.32 per share in separate transactions between February 13 and 25, 2015. The increase in fair market value of the 655,213 shares over the $3,963,780 principal retired was $4,434,383, representing the increase in our stock price over the conversion price as of the conversion dates. Accordingly, the total change in fair value of the Secured Convertible Notes payable was a $4,434,383 loss for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nSecured Convertible Notes Issuance Expenses\nWe elected to account for and record our Secured Convertible Notes on a fair value basis. Accordingly, we were required to expense the related issuance costs to other expense which totaled $93,845 and $579,066 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 2015 expenses were attributable to the proxy costs incurred for our Special Meeting of Shareholders held on February 13, 2015 to approve the issuance of shares above the Nasdaq Share Cap in connection with the issuance of the Secured Convertible Note in August 2014. The December 31, 2014 expenses included a $360,000 placement agent fee and the remainder was primarily legal fees.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income increased to $1,878 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from ($5,589) in 2014.\nInterest Expense\nWe incurred interest expense of $282,233 and $499,744 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $217,511 (44%). We issued an aggregate of $2.5 million principal amount of subordinated notes during 2011, which bore interest at the rate of 8% per annum until the notes were paid in full on July 24, 2015. On March 24, 2014, we issued the $2.0 million Secured Convertible Note that remained outstanding until its full conversion in three separate tranches between July 1, 2014 and September 19, 2014. On August 28, 2014, we issued the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note bearing interest at the rate of 6% per annum that remained outstanding until its full conversion in eight separate tranches between February 13, 2015 and February 25, 2015.\nWe amortized to interest expense $55,187 and $132,447, representing the discount associated with the $2.5 million subordinated note during years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The total remaining unamortized discount was $0 and $55,187 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nLoss before Income Tax Benefit\nAs a result of the above, we reported a loss before income tax benefit of $12,037,892 and $9,163,261 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a deterioration of $2,874,631 (31%).\nIncome Tax Benefit\nWe did not record an income tax benefit related to our losses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, due to our overall net operating loss carryforwards available. We have further determined to continue providing a full valuation reserve on our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015. During 2015, we increased our valuation reserve on deferred tax assets by $5,413,000 whereby our deferred tax assets continue to be fully reserved due to our recent operating losses.\n 25 \n \nWe had approximately $30,700,000 of net operating loss carryforwards and $1,747,000 of research and development tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2015 available to offset future net taxable income.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the above, we reported net losses of $12,037,892 and $9,163,261 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a deterioration of $2,874,631 (31%).\nBasic and Diluted Loss per Share\nThe basic and diluted loss per share was $2.77 and $3.54 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for the reasons previously noted. All outstanding stock options were considered antidilutive and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 because of the net loss reported for each period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverall:\nDuring 2011, we borrowed a total of $2.5 million under an unsecured credit facility with a private, third-party lender. The $2.5 million of subordinated notes bore interest at the rate of 8% per annum and are payable interest only on a monthly basis. The subordinated notes were subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness; as such term is defined in the Notes. On December 4, 2013, we entered into an agreement with the lender that extended the maturity dates of the subordinated notes from May 30, 2014 to May 30, 2015, which was later extended to August 15, 2015. The subordinated notes were unsecured and did not prevent us from obtaining new senior secured financings. On July 24, 2015, we paid the entire $2.5 million of outstanding principal together with all accrued interest in full.\nOn March 24, 2014, we completed a private placement of the $2.0 million Secured Convertible Note, which bore interest at 6% per annum, payable quarterly, and was secured by all of our assets. In addition, we issued the holder detachable warrants to acquire 130,000 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share (the March 2014 Warrant\u201d). On July 10, 2014 we and the holder of the $2.0 million Secured Convertible Note entered into an agreement under which we reduced the conversion price of the Senior Secured Note to $6.25 per share during the period from July 11 to July 14, 2014. During the foregoing period the holder converted $1,777,778 principal amount and $2,963 accrued interest on the Secured Convertible Note into 284,928 shares of our common stock. On July 15, 2014 the conversion price returned to $8.55 per share. The holder of the $2.0 million Secured Convertible Note exercised its right to convert the remaining outstanding principal into 26,263 shares of common stock in two separate tranches on August 28, 2014 and September 19, 2014. In addition, the holder exercised its warrant to purchase 130,000 shares of common stock resulting in cash proceeds of $951,600 during 2014 and utilized the cashless exercise feature for the remaining 6,621 shares.\nOn August 28, 2014, we completed a second private placement to the holder of the $2.0 million Secured Convertible Note and issued the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note, which bore interest at 6% per annum, payable quarterly, and was secured by all assets of the Company. Principal payments were not required until the sixth month after origination and continued ratably for the remaining 18-month term. The principal and interest payments could be made through the payment of cash or in-kind by transferring unrestricted and fully registered shares in an amount equivalent to 80% of the volume weighted average trading price for the 20 consecutive trading days preceding the payment date. The $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note was convertible into shares of common stock at the holder's option at a conversion price of $6.10 per share at any time it was outstanding. In addition, we could force conversion if the market price exceeded $12.20 per share for 20 consecutive trading days. In connection with the second private placement we issued a warrant exercisable to purchase 262,295 shares of common stock at $7.32 per share (the August Warrant\u201d), which was exercisable immediately and expires August 28, 2019.\n 26 \n \nOn December 4, 2014, the holder of the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note converted $36,600 of principal into 6,000 shares of common stock and in February 2015 the holder exercised its conversion rights on the remaining principal and accrued interest balances in exchange for an additional 655,213 shares of common stock. The $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note and August Warrant contained anti-dilution provisions and restricted the incurrence of additional secured indebtedness. We paid a placement agent fee of $240,000 and approximately $101,500 of other third party costs in connection with the transaction, which included legal fees. We used the funds generated by this credit facility to provide the working capital for our operations in 2015.\nIn connection with the anti-dilution provisions of the March 2014 Warrant, the Company was required to increase the number of shares to be issued upon the exercise of the March 2014 Warrant to 136,621 from 100,000 and to reduce the exercise price to $7.32 from $10.00 per share in connection with the August 2014 private placement.\nIn accordance with the terms of the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note we were required to maintain minimum cash balance of not less than $1.5 million until such time as we satisfied all of the Equity Conditions,\u201d as defined in the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note. Such Equity Conditions included our shareholders approving the issuance of shares above the Nasdaq Share Cap. The $1.5 million minimum cash balance was reported as restricted cash separate from cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014. On February 13, 2015, the shareholders approved the issuance of shares above the Nasdaq Share Cap, thereby releasing the restriction on the cash balances.\nBetween February 13 and 25, 2015 the holder of the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note exercised its right to convert the remaining principal on the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note into 655,738 shares of common stock and 5,475 shares for accrued interest at the conversion price of $7.32 per share. In addition, the holder also exercised part of its August Warrant to purchase 212,295 shares of common stock resulting in cash proceeds of $1,553,999 during first quarter 2015. The holder exercised part of its August Warrant to purchase 37,800 shares resulting in cash proceeds of $276,690 during second quarter 2015. Warrants to purchase a total of 12,200 common shares for $7.32 remain outstanding as of December 31, 2015.\nOn July 22, 2015, we closed a $12.0 million offering of our common stock and common stock purchase warrants in an at-the-market registered direct offering and a concurrent private placement of two series of common stock purchase warrants with two investors. At the closing we sold an aggregate of 879,766 shares of our common stock at a per share price of $13.64 in a registered direct offering to the investors. We also issued a registered short-term warrant to the investors exercisable to purchase a total of 437,086 shares of common stock in such offering. Additionally, in a concurrent private placement, we issued to the investors short-term warrants exercisable to purchase a total of 222,738 shares of common stock and long-term warrants exercisable to purchase a total of 879,766 shares of common stock. Both the short-term registered and private placement warrants are immediately exercisable, have an exercise price of $13.43 per share and expire 24 months from the date of issuance. The long-term warrants are immediately exercisable, have an exercise price of $13.43 per share and expire five and one-half years from the date of issuance. After placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses, the net offering proceeds to us totaled approximately $11.2 million prior to any exercise of the warrants. The warrants issued in this transaction did not contain terms that would require us to record derivative warrant liabilities that could affect our financial statements. Proceeds of the offering were used to repay the $2.5 million principal amount of subordinated notes plus accrued interest in full and for working capital purposes.\nAfter completion of the $12.0 million offering on July 22, 2015 and the payment of the $2.5 million principal amount of subordinated notes, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to support our operations for 2016. In addition, if the need arises, we may seek commercial credit facilities including traditional bank borrowings to improve our liquidity position and to finance growth opportunities or future capital needs that may arise.\nWe have warrants outstanding to purchase 1,599,290 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price $13.25 per share outstanding as of December 31, 2015. In addition, there are common stock purchase options outstanding covering 328,690 shares at an average price of $20.43 per share. The exercise of these common stock equivalents would provide us with an additional potential source of liquidity.\nWe had $6,924,079 of available cash and equivalents and net working capital of approximately $18.7 million as of December 31, 2015. Net working capital as of December 31, 2015 includes approximately $3.4 million of accounts receivable and $10.7 million of inventory.\n 27 \n \nCash and cash equivalents balances: As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents with an aggregate balance of $6,924,079, an increase from a balance of $3,049,716 at December 31, 2014. Summarized immediately below and discussed in more detail in the subsequent subsections are the main elements of the $3,874,363 net increase in cash during the year ended December 31, 2015:\n \u25cf Operating activities: $7,686,769 of net cash used in operating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $7,686,769 and $3,172,812 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a deterioration of $4,513,957. The deterioration was primarily the result of our net loss, increases in inventory and decreases in accounts payable offset by increases in deferred revenue and non-cash charges for stock based compensation and fair value changes on debt. Our goal is to increase revenues, return to profitability and decrease our inventory levels during 2016, thereby providing positive cash flows from operations, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in this regard. \u25cf Investing activities: $881,047 of net cash provided by investing activities. Cash provided by investing activities was $881,047 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to cash used in investing activities of $1,348,319 for the year ended December 31, 2014. In connection with the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note issued in August 2014, we were required to maintain a minimum cash balance of not less than $1.5 million until we satisfied all of the Equity Conditions,\u201d as defined in the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note (see Note 7). We satisfied the Equity Conditions\u201d on February 13, 2015, the restriction on the $1.5 million was lifted and the funds became available for working capital needs. In 2015, we replaced and upgraded our internal servers and infrastructure including upgrades to our enterprise software. In 2014 and 2015, we incurred costs for patent applications on our proprietary technology utilized in our new products and included in intangible assets. \u25cf Financing activities: $10,680,085 of net cash provided by financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $10,680,085 and $7,115,869 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. On July 22, 2015 we closed a $12.0 million offering of our common stock and common stock purchase warrants. After placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses, the net offering proceeds to us totaled approximately $11.2 million prior to any exercise of the warrants. Proceeds of the offering were used to repay the $2.5 million principal amount of the subordinated notes. We received $2,133,889 of proceeds in the year ended December 31, 2015 from the exercise of common stock warrants and options. On March 24, 2014, we issued the $2.0 million Secured Convertible Note, the proceeds of which were used for general working capital purposes. On August 25, 2014 we issued the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Note. We paid $93,845 and $579,066 of debt issuance costs in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the $2.0 and $4.0 million Secured Convertible Notes. During 2015 we acquired capital equipment financed through capital lease obligations and payments on such obligations represented the cash used in financing activities. \nThe net result of these activities was an increase in cash of $3,874,363 to $6,924,079 for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCommitments:\nWe had $6,924,079 of cash and cash equivalent balances and net positive working capital approximating $18.7 million as of December 31, 2015. Accounts receivable balances represented $3,368,909 of our net working capital at December 31, 2015. We intend to collect our outstanding receivables on a timely basis and reduce the overall level during 2016, which would help to provide positive cash flow to support our operations during 2016. Inventory represented $10,661,766 of our net working capital at December 31, 2015 and finished goods represented $7,895,663 of total inventory. We are actively managing the level of inventory and our goal is to reduce such levels during 2016 by our sales activities, which should provide additional cash flow to help support our operations during 2016.\n 28 \n \nCapital Expenditures. We had no material commitments for capital expenditures at December 31, 2015.\nLease commitments-Operating Leases. We have a long-term operating lease agreement for office and warehouse space that expires in April 2020. We have also entered into month-to-month leases for equipment and facilities. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $401,845 and $398,624, respectively, related to these leases. Following are our minimum lease payments for each year and in total.\n\nLicense agreements. We have several license agreements under which we have been assigned the rights to certain licensed materials used in our products. Certain of these agreements require us to pay ongoing royalties based on the number of products shipped containing the licensed material on a quarterly basis. Royalty expense related to these agreements aggregated $26,454 and $27,053 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFollowing is a summary of our licenses as of December 31, 2015:\n License Type Effective Date Expiration Date Terms Production software license agreement April 2005 April 2016 Automatically renews for one-year periods unless terminated by either party. Software sublicense agreement October 2007 October 2016 Automatically renews for one-year periods unless terminated by either party. Media analytics June 2015 May 2016 Either party may unilaterally terminate this agreement by written notice to the other party. \nSupply and distribution agreement.\nWe entered into a supply and distribution agreement with Dragoneye on May 1, 2010 under which it was granted the exclusive world-wide right to sell and distribute a proprietary law enforcement speed measurement device and derivatives to its customers. The term of the agreement was 42 months after the date Dragoneye began full scale production of the product, which commenced in August 2010 and final certification of the product was obtained. The agreement had minimum purchase requirements of 1,000 units per period over three commitment periods. On January 31, 2012, the agreement was amended to reduce the minimum purchase commitment over the second and third years by 52% of the original commitment. We agreed to release our world-wide right to exclusively market the product to the law enforcement community in exchange for the reduction in the purchase commitment.\nThe agreement originally required minimum order quantities that represent a remaining unfulfilled commitment to acquire $634,680 of product as of December 31, 2014. Dragoneye is responsible for all warranty, damage or other claims, losses or liabilities related to the product and is obligated to defend and indemnify us against such risks. We held approximately $1,318,000 of such products in finished goods inventory as of December 31, 2015 and had sold approximately 1,010 units since the beginning of the agreement through December 31, 2015.\nWe filed a lawsuit on June 15, 2013 against Dragoneye for breaching the contract and participated in a mediation of the lawsuit on August 12, 2015 that resulted in a settlement on August 25, 2015. The settlement includes the repair of all LaserAlly units we currently hold and future customer returned units exhibiting the same failure. See Litigation\u201d below for further details.\n 29 \n \nLitigation.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings arising from normal business operations. Although there can be no assurances, based on the information currently available, we believe that it is probable that the ultimate outcome of each of the actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. However, an adverse outcome in certain of the actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the period in which it is recorded.\nOn June 5, 2013, we filed a lawsuit in the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas against Dragoneye. We had entered into a supply and distribution agreement with Dragoneye on May 1, 2010 under which we were granted the right to sell and distribute a proprietary law enforcement speed measurement device and derivatives to our customers under the trade name LaserAlly. The parties amended the agreement on January 31, 2012. In our complaint we alleged that Dragoneye breached the contract because it failed to maintain as confidential information our customer list; it infringed on our trademarks, including LaserAlly and Digital Ally; it tortiously interfered with our existing contracts and business relationships with our dealers, distributors, customers and trading partners; and it engaged in unfair competition and violated the Kansas Uniform Trade Secrets Statutes. We amended the complaint to include claims regarding alleged material defects in the products supplied under the agreement. We participated in a mediation of the lawsuit on August 12, 2015 and agreed to an omnibus resolution of the matter. The settlement included the return of and repair free of charge of all LaserAlly units we held and future customer returned units exhibiting the same or similar failure. Dragoneye was allowed no more than 120 days from October 1, 2015 to repair all units, upgrade all units to current firmware release and to re-certify the units. We will remit the unpaid balance of approximately $191,000 ($91,684.47 remaining at December 31, 2015) currently recorded in accounts payable to Dragoneye in five payments concurrent with the repair and return of units by Dragoneye. Furthermore, all of the remaining minimum contractual purchase requirements were voided. On August 25, 2015, the judge approved the parties' joint stipulation of dismissal with prejudice, which finalized the settlement.\nOn October 25, 2013, we filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas to eliminate threats by a competitor, Utility Associates, Inc. ( Utility\u201d), of alleged patent infringement regarding U.S. Patent No. 6,831,556 (the '556 patent\u201d). Specifically, the lawsuit seeks a declaration that our mobile video surveillance systems do not infringe any claim of the '556 patent. We became aware that Utility had mailed letters to current and prospective purchasers of our mobile video surveillance systems threatening that the use of such systems purchased from third parties not licensed to the '556 patent would create liability for them for patent infringement. We reject Utility's assertion and will vigorously defend the right of end-users to purchase such systems from providers other than Utility. The United States District Court for the District of Kansas dismissed the lawsuit because it decided that Kansas was not the proper jurisdictional forum for the dispute. The District Court's decision was not a ruling on the merits of the case. We appealed the decision and the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court's previous decision.\nIn addition, we began proceedings to invalidate the '556 patent through a request for inter partes review of the '556 patent at the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO\u201d). On July 27, 2015, the USPTO invalidated key claims in Utility's '556 Patent. The Final Decision from the USPTO significantly curtails Utility's ability to threaten law enforcement agencies, municipalities, and others with infringement of the '556 Patent. Utility has appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Briefs have not yet been filed and no schedule for oral argument has been issued. We believe Utility will have a difficult time convincing the appellate court to overturn the decision of the USPTO.\nOn June 4, 2014 we filed an Unfair Competition lawsuit against Utility Associates, Inc. ( Utility\u201d) in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. In the lawsuit we contend that Utility has defamed us and illegally interfered with our contracts, customer relationships and business expectancies by falsely asserting to our customers and others that our products violate the '556 Patent, of which Utility claims to be the holder.\nOur suit also includes claims against Utility for tortious interference with contract and violation of the Kansas Uniform Trade Secrets Act, arising out of Utility's employment of one of our employees, in violation of that employee's Non-Competition and Confidentiality agreements with us. In addition to damages, we are seeking temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief, prohibiting Utility from, among other things, continuing to threaten or otherwise interfere with our customers. On March 4, 2015, an initial hearing was held upon our request for injunctive relief.\n 30 \n \nBased upon facts revealed at the March 4, 2015 hearing, on March 16, 2015, we sought leave to amend our Complaint in the Kansas suit to assert additional claims against Utility. Those new claims include claims of actual or attempted monopolization, in violation of \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act, claims arising under a new Georgia statute that prohibits threats of patent infringement in bad faith,\u201d and additional claims of unfair competition/false advertising in violation of \u00a7 63(a) of the Lanham Act. As these statutes expressly provide, we are seeking treble damages, punitive damages and attorneys' fees, as well as injunctive relief. The Court concluded its hearing on April 22, 2015, and allowed us leave to amend our complaint, but denied our preliminary injunction. The case is now in the discovery stage. However, we believe that the USPTO's final decision issued on July 27, 2015 will provide us with substantial basis to pursue our claims either through court trial or by summary judgment motions. We intend to pursue recovery from Utility, its insurers and other parties, as appropriate.\nOn June 13, 2014, Utility filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against us alleging infringement of the '556 patent. The suit was served on us on June 20, 2014. As alleged in our first filed lawsuit described above, we believe the '556 patent is both invalid and not infringed. Further, the USPTO issued its final decision invalidating 23 of the 25 claims asserted in the '556 Patent, as noted above. We believe that the suit filed by Utility is without merit and we will vigorously defend the claims asserted against us. An adverse resolution of the foregoing litigation or patent proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The Court stayed all proceedings with respect to this lawsuit pending the outcome of the patent review performed by the USPTO and the appellate court. Based on the USPTO's final decision to invalidate substantially all claims contained in the '556 patent, we intend to file for summary judgment in our favor if Utility does not request outright dismissal.\nThe Company received notice in April 2015 that TASER International, Inc. ( Taser\u201d), one of our competitors, had commenced an action in the USPTO for a re-examination of our U.S. Patent No. 8,781,292 ( the '292 Patent). A re-examination is essentially a request that the USPTO review whether the patent should have issued in its present form in view of the prior art,\u201d e.g., other patents in the same technology field. The prior art used by Taser to request the re-examination is a patent application (which never issued into a patent) assigned to an unrelated third party and was not the result of any of Taser's own research and development efforts.\nOur '292 Patent is directed to a system that determines when a recording device, such as a law enforcement officer's body camera or in-car video recorder, begins recording and automatically instructs other recording devices to begin recording. The technology described in the '292 Patent is incorporated in our VuLink product.\nOn August 17, 2015 the USPTO issued a first, non-final action rejecting all 20 claims of the '292 Patent respecting our'292 Patent, which was undergoing an ex parte re-examination. We were provided the opportunity to discuss the merits of the prior art and the scope of the patent claims with the patent Examiner handling the reexamination and to amend the patent claims. On January 14, 2016 the USPTO ultimately rejected Taser's efforts and confirmed the validity of the '292 patent with 59 claims covering various aspects of our auto-activation technology. On February 2, 2016 the USPTO issued another patent relating our auto-activation technology for law enforcement cameras. U.S. Patent No. 9,253,452 ( the '452 patent\u201d) generally covers the automatic activation and coordination of multiple recording devices in response to a triggering event such as a law enforcement officer activating the light bar on the vehicle.\nThe Company filed suit on January 15, 2016 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas (Case No: 2:16-cv-02032) against Taser, alleging that Taser willfully infringed the '292 Patent by selling and offering to sell its Axon camera product line and Signal Performance Power Magazine. The lawsuit was initiated after the USPTO reconfirmed the validity of the '292 patent. On February 2, 2016, we amended our complaint against Taser, further alleging that Taser is directly and indirectly liable for infringing the '452 Patent. Our amended complaint seeks both monetary damages and a permanent injunction against Taser for infringing both the '452 and '292 Patents.\nIn addition to the '452 Patent infringement claims, the February 2, 2016 amended complaint added a new set of claims to the lawsuit alleging that Taser conspired to keep us out of the marketplace by engaging in improper, unethical, and unfair competition. The amended lawsuit alleges Taser bribed officials and otherwise conspired to secure no-bid contracts for its products in violation of both state law and federal antitrust law. Our lawsuit also seeks monetary and injunctive relief, including treble damages, for these alleged violations.\nOn February 19, 2016 TASER asked for and was granted an extension of time to answer or otherwise plead to the complaint alleging willful patent infringement, the bribery of officials and otherwise conspired to secure no-bid contracts for its products in violation of both state law and federal antitrust law. On March 4, 2016, TASER filed a motion to dismiss our complaint which is now pending before the court.\n 31 \n \nOn or about May 22, 2014, Stephen Gans, a former director and former principal shareholder of us, filed a complaint in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada that asserts claims against us and Stanton E. Ross, Leroy C. Richie, Daniel F. Hutchins and Elliot M. Kaplan (the Defendant Directors\u201d), who are members of its Board of Directors. We were served with the complaint on May 28, 2014. Among other things, the complaint alleged (i) that the Defendant Directors breached their fiduciary duties by failing to consider a financing proposal offered by Mr. Gans and his affiliates; and (ii) that the Defendant Directors, acting at the direction of Stanton E. Ross, did not independently and objectively evaluate Mr. Gans' protestations about certain alleged transactions between us and Infinity Energy Resources, Inc., and by so doing, breached their fiduciary duties. We and the Defendant Directors vigorously defended the claims asserted against us and them. We and the Defendant Directors filed a response denying all of the plaintiff's allegations and have asserted counter-claims that allege that Gans committed improper acts that included: (a) failing to disclose the nature and substance of an SEC investigation of Gans; (b) engaging in potential insider trading; (c) misappropriating our confidential information; (d) attempting to use his position as a director to personally enrich himself; and (e) making unauthorized, misleading, and factually inaccurate filings to the SEC about us.\nOn December 11, 2014, the parties agreed in principle to compromise and dismiss with prejudice substantially all of their claims. Within the scope of that settlement are each of the shareholder derivative claims\u201d that Gans had asserted against us and the Defendant Directors. The settlement to which the parties agreed resulted in no monetary recovery by any party. On April 7, 2015 the Court approved the settlement of all shareholder derivative claims.\nWe are also involved as a plaintiff and defendant in ordinary, routine litigation and administrative proceedings incidental to its business from time to time, including customer collections, vendor and employment-related matters. We believe that the likely outcome of any other pending cases and proceedings will not be material to our business or financial condition.\nSponsorship. On April 16, 2015 we entered into a Title Sponsorship Agreement under which we became the title sponsor for a Web.com Tour golf tournament (the Tournament\u201d) held annually in the Kansas City Metropolitan area. Such Agreement provides us with naming rights and other benefits for the 2015 through 2019 annual Tournament in exchange for the following sponsorship fee:\n\nWe have the right to sell and retain the proceeds from the sale of additional sponsorships, including but not limited to a presenting sponsorship, a concert sponsorship and founding partnerships for the Tournament. We recorded a net sponsorship expense of $173,335 relating to the 2015 Tournament during the year ended December 31, 2015. Such expense was included in sales and promotional expense in the accompanying statement of operations.\nStock Repurchase Program. On August 25, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $2.5 million of the Company's common stock in the open market, or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchases, if and when made, will be subject to market conditions, applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other factors. The repurchase program will be funded using a portion of cash and cash equivalents, along with cash flow from operations. Purchases may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time. We have not repurchased any shares under this program as of December 31, 2015.\n(k) Plan. We sponsor a 401(k) retirement savings plan for the benefit of our employees. The plan, as amended, requires us to provide 100% matching contributions for employees, who elect to contribute up to 3% of their compensation to the plan and 50% matching contributions for employee's elective deferrals on the next 2% of their contributions. We made matching contributions totaling $163,227 and $156,071 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Each participant is 100% vested at all times in employee and employer matching contributions.\n 32 \n \nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1, Financial Statements\u201d, of this report. While the selection and application of any accounting policy may involve some level of subjective judgments and estimates, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to our financial statements, potentially involve the most subjective judgments in their selection and application, and are the most susceptible to uncertainties and changing conditions:\n \u25cf Revenue Recognition / Allowance for Doubtful Accounts; \u25cf Allowance for Excess and Obsolete Inventory; \u25cf Warranty Reserves; \u25cf Stock-based Compensation Expense; and \u25cf Accounting for Income Taxes; and \u25cf Determination of Fair Value Calculation for Financial Instruments and Derivatives. \nRevenue Recognition / Allowances for Doubtful Accounts. Revenue is recognized for the shipment of products or delivery of service when all four of the following conditions are met:\n\nWe review all significant, unusual or nonstandard shipments of product or delivery of services as a routine part of our accounting and financial reporting process to determine compliance with these requirements. Extended warranties are offered on selected products and when a customer purchases an extended warranty the associated proceeds are treated as deferred revenue and recognized over the term of the extended warranty.\nOur principal customers are state, local and federal law enforcement agencies, which historically have been low risks for uncollectible accounts. We also have commercial customers and international distributors who may present a greater risk for uncollectible accounts than such law enforcement customers and we consider a specific reserve for bad debts based on their individual circumstances. Our historical bad debts have been negligible, with less than $195,000 charged off as uncollectible on cumulative revenues of $185.8 million since we commenced deliveries during 2006. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had provided a reserve for doubtful accounts of $74,997 and $65,977, respectively.\nWe periodically perform a specific review of significant individual receivables outstanding for risk of loss due to uncollectibility. Based on such review, we consider our reserve for doubtful accounts to be adequate as of December 31, 2015. However, if the balance due from any significant customer ultimately becomes uncollectible, then our allowance for bad debts will not be sufficient to cover the charge-off and we will be required to record additional bad debt expense in our statement of operations.\nAllowance for Excess and Obsolete Inventory. We record valuation reserves on our inventory for estimated excess or obsolete inventory items. The amount of the reserve is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. On a quarterly basis, management performs an analysis of the underlying inventory to identify reserves needed for excess and obsolescence. We use our best judgment to estimate appropriate reserves based on this analysis. In addition, we adjust the carrying value of inventory if the current market value of that inventory is below its cost.\nInventories consisted of the following at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\n\n 33 \n \nWe balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to our customers against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to changing technology and customer requirements. As reflected above, our inventory reserves represented 10.1% of the gross inventory balance at December 31, 2015, compared to 6.1% of the gross inventory balance at December 31, 2014. We had $1,202,411 and $600,578 in reserves for obsolete and excess inventories at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Total raw materials and component parts were $3,833,873 and $2,987,124 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, an increase of $846,749 (28%). The increase in raw materials and component parts is primarily attributable to increased forecasts of sales for the FirstVU HD and the need to secure long lead component inventory items in advance of production. Finished goods balances were $7,895,663 and $6,576,480 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, an increase of $1,319,183 (20%). The increase in finished goods was primarily in DVM-750 products and additional cameras for our various products. Finished goods at December 31, 2015 consist primarily of the Laser Ally products, normal levels of our DVM-500 Plus product and the increased DVM-750 product inventories in anticipation of the closing of several significant international contracts. The increase in the inventory reserve is primarily due to the change in sales mix of our products which has resulted in a higher level of excess component parts of the older versions of our legacy products. We believe the reserves are appropriate given our inventory levels at December 31, 2015.\nIf actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or significant engineering changes to our products that are not anticipated and appropriately managed, additional inventory write-downs may be required in excess of the inventory reserves already established.\nWarranty Reserves. We generally provide up to a two-year parts and labor warranty on our products to our customers. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims. We actively study trends of claims and take action to improve product quality and minimize claims. Our warranty reserves were decreased to $159,838 as of December 31, 2015 compared to $247,082 as of December 31, 2014. We have limited experience with the FirstVU HD and DVM-800 and will monitor our reserve for all warranty claims related to these two newer products. There is a risk that we will have higher warranty claim frequency rates and average cost of claims than our history has indicated on our legacy mirror products on our new products for which we have limited experience. Actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods.\nStock-based Compensation Expense. We grant stock options to our employees and directors and such benefits provided are share-based payment awards which require us to make significant estimates related to determining the value of our share-based compensation. In 2015, we issued no stock options as we continued our trend of issuing restricted common shares subject to vesting requirements. As such, stock based compensation is now based upon the grant date market value of the restricted shares which is an objective measure.\nAccounting for Income Taxes. Accounting for income taxes requires significant estimates and judgments on the part of management. Such estimates and judgments include, but are not limited to, the effective tax rate anticipated to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future, the sufficiency of taxable income in future periods to realize the benefits of net deferred tax assets and net operating losses currently recorded and the likelihood that tax positions taken in tax returns will be sustained on audit.\nAs required by authoritative guidance, we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Authoritative guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2014, cumulative valuation allowances in the amount of $12,692,000 were recorded in connection with the net deferred income tax assets. Based on a review of our deferred tax assets and recent operating performance, we determined that our valuation allowance should be increased to $18,105,000 to fully reserve our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2015. We determined that it was appropriate to continue to provide a full valuation reserve on our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 because of the overall net operating loss carryforwards available. We expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets. To the extent we determine that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not based upon expected future taxable income, a portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed. Such a reversal would be recorded as an income tax benefit and, for some portion related to deductions for stock option exercises, an increase in shareholders' equity.\n 34 \n \nAs required by authoritative guidance, we have performed a comprehensive review of our portfolio of uncertain tax positions in accordance with recognition standards established by the FASB, an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return, that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. We have no recorded liability as of December 31, 2015 representing uncertain tax positions.\nWe have generated substantial deferred income tax assets related to our operations primarily from the charge to compensation expense taken for stock options, certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards. For us to realize the income tax benefit of these assets, we must generate sufficient taxable income in future periods when such deductions are allowed for income tax purposes. In some cases where deferred taxes were the result of compensation expense recognized on stock options, our ability to realize the income tax benefit of these assets is also dependent on our share price increasing to a point where these options have intrinsic value at least equal to the grant date fair value and are exercised. In assessing whether a valuation allowance is needed in connection with our deferred income tax assets, we have evaluated our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to utilize the benefit of the deferred income tax assets. We continue to evaluate our ability to use recorded deferred income tax asset balances. If we fail to generate taxable income for financial reporting in future years, no additional tax benefit would be recognized for those losses, since we will not have accumulated enough positive evidence to support our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards in the future. Therefore, we may be required to increase our valuation allowance in future periods should our assumptions regarding the generation of future taxable income not be realized.\nDetermination of Fair Value for Financial Instruments and Derivatives. During 2014 in two separate transactions we issued a total of $6.0 million of Secured Convertible Notes with detachable warrants to purchase common stock. We elected to record the Secured Convertible Notes on their fair value basis. In addition, the warrants to purchase common stock contained anti-dilution provisions that required them to be accounted for as derivative liabilities. We were required to determine the fair value of these financial instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 for financial reporting purposes. The entire principal balance of the Secured Convertible Notes had been converted and all warrants had been exercised, except for warrants to acquire 12,200 common shares at $7.32 per share, as of December 31, 2015.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820\u201d), we utilize the market approach to measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, liabilities or a group of assets or liabilities, such as a business.\nASC 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:\n \u25cf Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities \u25cf Level 2 - Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities) \u25cf Level 3 - Significant unobservable inputs (including the Company's own assumptions in determining the fair value) \n 35 \n \nThe following table represents our hierarchy for our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015.\n\nInflation and Seasonality\nInflation has not materially affected us during the past fiscal year. We do not believe that our business is seasonal in nature; however, we generally generate higher revenues during the second half of the calendar year compared to the first half.", "item_7_tables":

Key factors impacting performance were product issues with their FirstVU cameras requiring upgrades and related inventory write-downs, as well as competitive pressures.\n\nKey Financial Trends\n- Revenue declined slightly to $20 million in 2015 from $17.4 million in 2014. New products like the FirstVU body camera and DVM-800 in-car system made up over 50% of sales.\n- Gross margins fell from 57% in 2014 to 42% in 2015, largely due to $1.6 million in inventory write-downs for the FirstVU upgrades. \n- Operating expenses rose with more spending on R&D, sales & marketing, and staff to support products and customers. This resulted in a wider operating loss of $7.6 million compared to $2.9 million in 2014.\n- Litigation expenses were incurred related to patent disputes with competitors. Settlement was reached in one case related to a speed measurement device provided by a supplier.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- The company raised $12 million from a stock offering in 2015 to provide working capital and repay debt.  \n- Inventory balances grew by 20% putting pressure on cash balances, so reducing inventory is a priority for 2016.\n- Cash used in operations increased to $7.7 million in 2015 from $3.2 million in 2014 due to the net loss and inventory growth.\n\nThe report provides details on financial performance, legal matters, new products, and liquidity challenges facing Digital Ally. Returning to profitability and managing inventory appear to be main areas of focus going forward."}
